2,644822b3-8dcb-3da0-a288-d11a79652993,RRC,2023-04-15,An Intrinsic Calculation For Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) Suggests It's 25% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-range-resources-corporation-120740144.html,1681560460,STORY,['RRC'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Range Resources fair value estimate is US$36.48Current share price of US$27.26 suggests Range Resources is potentially 25% undervalued Analyst price target for RRC is US$31.83 which is 13% below our fair value estimateToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Range Resources The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$560.6mUS$747.1mUS$1.14bUS$983.0mUS$755.0mUS$752.0mUS$754.6mUS$761.1mUS$770.4mUS$781.8mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -0.40%Est @ 0.34%Est @ 0.86%Est @ 1.22%Est @ 1.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10.0% US$510US$618US$856US$672US$469US$425US$388US$356US$327US$302(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.9bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$782m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10.0%– 2.1%) = US$10bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$10b÷ ( 1 + 10.0%)10= US$3.9bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$8.8b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$27.3, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Range Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.332. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Range ResourcesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Eli Lilly’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+25.4% vs. +10.3%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others. Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes already launched and cancer drug Jaypirca already approved.Mounjaro is off to a solid start. However, the CRL for donanemab and mirikizumab will probably delay potential launch of the candidates by several months.Generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drug, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are a few top-line headwinds. Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of Q1 results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+3.0% vs. -11.1%). The company’s robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.During the fourth quarter, the company opened a new bioanalytical lab in Richmond, VA to support its clinical research business. The integration of PPD is largely complete and drove strong returns for the shareholders with outstanding execution and business performance throughout the year.However, revenues within Europe declined in the low teens. The same in Asia Pacific fell in the mid-single digits, while China registered a decline in the mid-single digits. Revenues in the rest of the world declined in high-single digits.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+7.0% vs. -0.1%). The company enjoys a consistent level of contract flows, and subsequent backlog growth bolsters its long-term revenue prospects.It remains the largest U.S. defense contractor that has a steady order inflow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The U.S. budgetary provisions boost LMT’s business. Lockheed expects to deliver 147 to 153 F-35 aircraft in 2023 and 2024.However, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results.

(ISRG). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Thermo Fisher Scientific has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Intuitive Surgical, Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that TMO is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TMO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 24.92, while ISRG has a forward P/E of 50.55. We also note that TMO has a PEG ratio of 1.99. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ISRG currently has a PEG ratio of 4.24.Another notable valuation metric for TMO is its P/B ratio of 5.27. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ISRG has a P/B of 8.48.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help TMO earn a Value grade of B, while ISRG has been given a Value grade of D.TMO stands above ISRG thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that TMO is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

13,ae82bac9-8d56-36e2-9bb3-47149161158a,TMO,2023-04-15,Is Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-tmo-130030622.html,1681477230,STORY,['TMO'],"[Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Net Debt?As you can see below, Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$34.4b of debt, at December 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. On the flip side, it has US$8.52b in cash leading to net debt of about US$25.8b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$17.0b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$36.0b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$8.52b and US$9.43b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$35.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Of course, Thermo Fisher Scientific has a titanic market capitalization of US$228.0b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Thermo Fisher Scientific's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.2 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 18.9 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Unfortunately, Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT flopped 17% over the last four quarters. If earnings continue to decline at that rate then handling the debt will be more difficult than taking three children under 5 to a fancy pants restaurant. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Thermo Fisher Scientific's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific recorded free cash flow worth 76% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewBoth Thermo Fisher Scientific's ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT and its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow gave us comfort that it can handle its debt. In contrast, our confidence was undermined by its apparent struggle to grow its EBIT. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Thermo Fisher Scientific is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Thermo Fisher Scientific .If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

A similar suit filed by Washington, DC, was dismissed in 2021.“Many of the complaint’s allegations are inaccurate,” a spokesperson for Amazon said. “We look forward to presenting the facts to the court.”Amazon has previously said in its defense that sellers set their own prices in the company’s online store.“There is no shortage of evidence showing that the ‘Everything store’ is costing consumers more for just about everything,” Bonta said in a statement.A San Francisco state judge in March denied Amazon’s request for dismissal of California’s claims, saying he was “unpersuaded” by the company’s argument that the state didn’t adequately allege how pricing practices had a market-wide anticompetitive effect.Story continuesInternal documents show an Amazon executive saying that expanded penalties “may generate pushback given recent positive press about our change to remove the previous price parity clause” from agreements with merchants that prevented third-party sellers from offering lower prices on other sites. The company expected the media and sellers would claim the policy “was not only trivial but a trick and an attempt to garner goodwill with policy makers amid increasing competition concerns,” according to the complaint.The 2022 suit came three years after Bloomberg reported that the company’s policies were forcing sellers to charge more on competing sites like Walmart because Amazon would bury their products in search results if they offered lower prices elsewhere.Read more: Amazon Squeezes Sellers That Offer Better Prices on WalmartAmazon’s vice president of pricing told the account manager of a seller who complained in 2019 about having to lower prices on Amazon to match his own online store that the merchant should should “control prices across all his channels,” according to internal communications cited in the complaint.“[Y]ou might want to ask him to check if his sales on other sites directly or through distributors is putting him and us at a relative competitive disadvantage,” the executive wrote in a message that included a smiley emoji. “He might get the hint :)”California’s probe into Amazon’s practices also highlighted concerns that ads on the platform are unhelpful for customers.“Amazon’s chief economist himself bemoaned the ‘secondary impacts on customer experience at Amazon stores” of ads to the extent they “reduce selection, are not relevant to the customer’s search, and/or lead to increases in prices,’” the state said in its complaint.The unsealed court filings include negative feedback from customers. “I can’t see how Amazon needs that much advertising,” one shopper wrote. “Amazon is not taxed, makes huge profits every year, yet they waste my time w/ products that are not relevant to my search.”Amazon advertising revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter, to $11.6 billion. The fast-growing revenue source helps prop up Amazon’s otherwise low-margin online retail business that carries the high expense of operating warehouses around the country and delivering orders to shoppers’ homes.--With assistance from Spencer Soper.(Updates with Amazon’s statement)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Repo Man Returns as More Americans Fall Behind on Car PaymentsAmericans Go Deeper Into Debt as They Use Buy Now, Pay Later Apps for GroceriesRepublicans Fight a Solar Boom That’s Made Texas King of Clean EnergySan Jose Plans Robocar Network Instead of Airport ShuttlePeople Are Using AI for Therapy, Even Though ChatGPT Wasn’t Built for It©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

But Canada’s New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh is not a fan.“The truth is Loblaws makes $1 million in EXCESS profits a day,” Singh says in a tweet. “And while you struggle, Liberals and Conservatives take donations from them and stay silent.”Loblaws Companies (TSE:L) operates one of the largest grocery store chains in Canada. It has more than 2,400 stores across the country, including the Loblaws banner and other popular brands such as Shoppers Drug Mart, No Frills and Real Canadian Superstore.Don't miss: Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate Market: Here’s How You Can Act Now Before It’s Too LateSo how much profit does the company actually make?A Lucrative Business2022 was a difficult year for some industries, but Loblaws continued to grow both its top and bottom lines.For the year, the company brought in C$56.5 billion of revenue, representing a 6.3% increase year over year. Adjusted earnings came in at C$2.26 billion, up 18.4% from 2021.It’s no surprise, though. Around 90% of Canadians live within 10 kilometers of one of Loblaw’s locations. And no matter what happens to the economy, people still need to buy food.Plus, in times of rampant inflation, established grocery store operators can often pass along rising costs to consumers.By running a resilient and profitable business, Loblaws also increased its dividend last year. In fact, grocers have long been a staple for investors looking for passive income.Of course, you don’t need to go north of the border to tap into the segment. There are plenty of grocery store companies in the U.S. that reward shareholders with reliable and increasing dividends. Here’s a look at two of them.Kroger (NYSE: KR)Supermarket giant Kroger hasn’t been a market favorite over the past year as shares tumbled nearly 20%. But its business is still heading in the right direction.Story continuesIn the company’s fiscal 2022, which ended Jan. 28, 2023, total sales increased 7.5% to $148.3 billion. Same-store sales, a critical measure of a retailer’s performance, grew 5.6%.At the bottom line, Kroger generated adjusted earnings of $4.23 per share in fiscal 2022, up 15% from the prior fiscal year.Notably, despite dealing with rising costs due to inflation, Kroger’s cost savings exceeded $1 billion for the fifth consecutive year.Last summer, the company announced a 24% increase to its quarterly dividend to 26 cents per share.That marked Kroger’s 16th consecutive annual dividend hike. At the current share price, the company offers an annual dividend yield of 2.3%.In the latest earnings release, Kroger said that it “expects to continue to pay its quarterly dividend and expects this to increase over time, subject to board approval.”Walmart (NYSE: WMT)When it comes to paying dividends in the grocery business, few companies have done a better job than Walmart.Since declaring its first annual dividend in March 1974, Walmart has increased its payout every single year.The latest dividend hike arrived this February when Walmart’s board approved a 2% increase to the annual cash dividend to $2.28 per share. That marked the company’s 50th consecutive year of dividend increases.Those dividend hikes are backed by Walmart’s deeply entrenched market position. The company has over 10,500 stores and numerous e-commerce websites in 20 countries, attracting around 240 million customers every week.Due to its sheer size, Walmart’s numbers dwarf most competitors, but they are still increasing. In the 12 months that ended Jan. 31, total revenue grew 6.7% to $611.3 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have increased by 7.4% to $615.1 billion.The company currently offers an annual dividend yield of 1.5%. If you are searching for high-yield ideas, it might be worthwhile to look beyond the stock market. These days, it’s easy for investors to tap into real, income-producing assets like multifamily real estate, even if you are not an ultra-high net worth individual.Check Out More from BenzingaRooted In Stability: How Farmland Investments Have Outperformed in Uncertain Economic Climates'People-First' Real Estate Fund Shares Rent With Tenants While Generating Strong Returns For Investors Photo courtesy of Paul McKinnon on ShutterstockDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Notably, the strategy aims to link stores and services to expedite deliveries, expanding online offerings, and add cheaper merchandise at its Rack off-price stores. Increased focus on distribution capabilities, along with improved connectivity of physical and digital inventory, is likely to contribute to Nordstrom Rack sales by $2 billion in the long term.As part of the strategy, Nordstrom earlier issued a long-term outlook. It predicted revenue growth in the low-single digits on an annual basis, with operating income likely to outpace revenues in the long term.

That would be the first ever casino in the country. And it could present a new opportunity for the gambling company, which has had success in China's Macau region prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns. You see there, the stock, though, down just slightly, though, about 0.1%. But an interesting development there for the city of Osaka.DAVE BRIGGS: It certainly is. You might have expected a little more reaction from investors, given the opportunity there. Now, Macau, we're talking about pre-COVID. Obviously, they've had so many issues with COVID shutdowns time after time after time. But pre-COVID, we're talking about in the neighborhood of $30 billion annually in gaming revenue.So this is a huge opportunity, although it's interesting digging into the story a little bit, Rachelle, not exactly well received in Japan, not right now, at least. There's a few polls namely with the major newspapers there that show about 45% oppose gaming there, and only 30% to 35% are approving of it. So it's not met with open arms. And that's part of the reason they're making this a real cultural center. That's part of the game, the plan that they've laid out with MGM and their local partner there. And so it should be an interesting story to play out. 2029, I think, when they're talking about opening.]"

Europe now takes in only 8% of Russia's oil exports, per Kpler.""Both China and Russia are taking advantage of discounted Russian crude, benefiting from the sanctions applied on Russian materials by other countries,"" Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler, told Insider Friday.Behind China and India, Turkey and Bulgaria are the biggest buyers of Russian crude.Even before Vladimir Putin launched his war on Ukraine, China was already a top buyer of Russian crude, importing 25% of its crude from the country in 2021. That's since climbed to 36%, Kpler data shows.India, the world's third-largest oil importer, relied on Russia for about 1% of its total volumes prior to the war, but now buys 51% of its oil from Russia.The US has led Europe and other Western nations in imposing sanctions and energy price caps on Russia, designed to maintain market flows while curtailing Moscow's export revenue.Story continuesEuropean Central Bank calculations show trade volume between the euro area and Russia has halved since February 2022, with the bloc's imports of Russian imports seeing particularly steep declines following the bans on coal in August 2022, crude oil in December 2022, and refined oil products in February 2023.The ECB chart below shows a similar pattern illustrated in Kpler's data, with Russian seaborne crude exports shifting toward Asian buyers and away from Europe.European Central Bank, ECB Economic BulletinTo be sure, the revenue Russia generates from its energy exports has fallen along with the drop in prices, even as volumes remain elevated.The International Energy Agency said Friday that Moscow's revenue is down about 43% compared to the same time last year.But oil prices are heading back up as China's reopening economy drives demand while OPEC and Russia pinch supplies.Earlier this month, OPEC+ announced a surprise production cut of over 1 million barrels a day, with Russia extending its 500,000-barrel-a-day pullback through mid-2023.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

OPEC+ announced a surprise production cut earlier this month of over 1 million barrels a day. Russia, which is a member of OPEC+, said it would extend its cut of 500,000 barrels a day cut through mid-2023.""Our oil market balances were already set to tighten in the second half of 2023, with the potential for a substantial supply deficit to emerge. The latest cuts risk exacerbating those strains, pushing both crude and product prices higher. Consumers currently under siege from inflation will suffer even more from higher prices, especially in emerging and developing economies,"" the IEA said.Oil prices briefly spiked into the triple-digits last year as Russia's invasion of Ukraine created chaos in markets. Prices have since eased, but the new cuts from OPEC+ would likely more than counteract any non-OPEC+ production increases this year, the IEA said.West Texas Intermediate crude is up 2.4% year to date, and Brent crude, the international benchmark, is up 1.6%.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

Here's what it means,USA TODAY,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1db970d6-0d94-3c53-b5e4-ae17473ca936/why-are-gas-prices-rising%3F.html,1681491091,STORY,['CL=F'],"[The weather is heating up, and so are gas prices.The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline rose eight cents since last week to $3.66 due to the rise in oil prices, nonprofit federation of motor clubs AAA said on Thursday. Oil, gas’ main ingredient, accounts for more than half the price of a gallon of gas.Though a gallon of gas is still 41 cents less than a year ago, analysts warn prices still have room to rise in the near-term and put a crimp in people’s budgets.“Consumers confronted by inflated prices for basic necessities will now have to spread their budgets even more thinly,” International Energy Agency (IEA) said in an oil outlook on Friday. “This augurs badly for the economic recovery and growth.”Gas price prediction: Gas prices are down but projected to rise again. How much will gas cost in 2023?Why are oil (and gas) prices rising?Oil prices initially got a boost earlier in April after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries surprisingly announced it would cut production starting in May by 1.66 million barrels per day.On Friday morning, oil rose further after IEA predicted global oil demand will climb by 2 million barrels a day this year to a record 101.9 million barrels per day, “buoyed by a resurgent China.” It estimates 90% of the growth in oil demand will come from China.In the U.S., refineries also are performing routine spring maintenance and transitioning to producing summer gas, which temporarily constricts supply and boosts prices. Summer gas produces less emissions and is more expensive to produce, whereas cheaper winter gas ignites more easily to start your car in cold temperaturesWarm weather usually draws out more drivers, too, boosting demand for gas.All these factors helped pushed America’s West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices to a four-month high around $83 per barrel on Friday.“When the cost of crude oil crosses the $80 a barrel mark, that puts a lot of upward pressure on what we pay at the pump,” said Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson.Story continuesGreen energy: Biden boosts clean energy in coal country despite facing pushback from Congress on climateRisky cheap gas move: Cheaper gas in the Midwest could actually be over a billion dollar risk for some statesGas prices are displayed at a Mobil gas station in Prospect Heights, Ill., Sunday, Jan. 29, 2023.How high will gas prices rise?No one expects average nationwide gas prices to challenge last June’s record $5.016 per gallon, but analysts generally expect prices to continue ticking higher over the next couple of months.“$4.50 (per gallon) might be something we could see later this spring or summer, but it comes with huge uncertainty,” said Nikolai Roussanov, Wharton finance professor. “The economy is slowing. If the economy slows enough to reduce demand, then we won’t see gas prices go as high. I think gas will probably be somewhere between here and $4.50.”Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, expects gas prices to start sliding again in June.“Expect the upward trend to continue through much of the rest of spring, but once the transition to summer gasoline and refinery maintenance are behind us, April and May jumps could bring June slumps,” he said.

For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark rose 2.3% from the March 6 settlement of $80.70.London-traded Brent, the global benchmark for crude, settled up 22 cents, or 0.3%, at $86.31. For the week, Brent gained 1.4%.Crude prices lost much of their upward momentum after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, one of the central bank’s biggest hawks on interest rates, said he desires more monetary tightening despite evidence that inflation in the United States was coming off four-decade highs. Higher rates benefit the dollar.Oil markets rallied earlier in the day after the Paris-based International Energy Agency, IEA, said demand for crude could hit a record peak in 2023, helped by a spike in consumption by top importer China.But the IEA also warned that the surprise oil output cut announced earlier this month by producer group OPEC+ risks exacerbating a projected supply deficit and could scupper economic recovery.“Consumers confronted by inflated prices for basic necessities will now have to spread their budgets even more thinly,” the IEA said. “This augurs badly for the economic recovery and growth.”OPEC+ groups the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with 10 independent oil producers, including Russia. The wider alliance announced on April 3 that it will cut a further 1.7 million barrels daily from its output, adding to an earlier pledge from November to take off 2.0M barrels per day.OPEC+, however, has a history of over-promising and under-delivering on production cuts. While the group achieved over-compliance on promised cuts in the aftermath of the 2020 coronavirus breakout, experts say that was more a result of battered demand that led to minimal production, rather than a will to cut barrels as pledged.Story continuesRelated ArticlesOil up as IEA sees 2023 demand spike; Strong dollar cuts gainsNatural gas sees first weekly gain in six; Sub-$2 risk still highOil rises, logs weekly gains after IEA predicts record demand]"

However, in absolute term, inflation remains well above the Fed’s 2% target. With market participants adopting a cautious approach in view of the positive and the negative factors, U.S. stock markets have witnessed rangebound trading in the past two weeks.Moreover, continued worries over the regional banking system and the fallout from the forced UBS-Credit Suisse tie-up means that volatile trading in U.S. stocks is expected to continue for some time. We believe that more visibility regarding the future market direction will only be available after first-quarter 2023 earnings results, along with management guidance and business outlook.Till then, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures a winning option on your hands. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through.

38,86690a72-5816-3647-9a68-5b49846ce691,CRM,2023-04-15,Wall Street Analysts Think Salesforce.com (CRM) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-salesforce-133001276.html,1681479001,STORY,['CRM'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Salesforce.com (CRM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.81, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.81 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.5% and 5.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Salesforce.com, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is CRM Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $7.11.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.

39,767c3c58-0cd0-31ab-9734-b18aa87e6457,MRO,2023-04-15,"Buy These 2 Oil Stocks, Analysts Say, Predicting Strong Gains Ahead",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-2-oil-stocks-analysts-132851715.html,1681478931,STORY,"['MRO', 'NOG']","[Last week, OPEC announced significant production cuts to be implemented on May 1, totaling approximately 1.16 million barrels of oil per day. This reduction in supply comes at a time when demand is expected to accelerate during the summer travel season, with projections of demand reaching 102 million bpd later this year. As a result, we can expect an anticipated shortfall in supplies, which will likely result in higher prices at the pump and a potential boost to inflation.For investors, however, there will be opportunities. While the impact of higher oil prices on the broader economy is likely to be negative, the narrower energy sector is looking at a potential windfall of increased earnings. Investors can cash in, too, by finding solid oil stocks with potential for gains in what otherwise promises to be a turbulent summer.We’ve taken the first step, and used TipRanks, the world’s biggest database of analysts and research, to pull up the details on two oil stocks that are primed for gains under the new conditions of the energy market. Each stock has its own unique history – but right now, the Street’s analysts are predicting strong gains, up to 30% or better, for the coming year. Let’s take closer look.Northern Oil and Gas (NOG)We’ll start with Northern Oil and Gas, an exploration and production company working in the North American hydrocarbon sector. Northern operates in three main geographical areas of the continental US: the Williston Basin of Montana and the Dakotas; the Permian Basin of Texas-New Mexico; and the Marcellus formation of western Pennsylvania. The Williston Basin makes up the bulk of Northern’s activities, accounting for approximately 64% of the company’s production.Northern recently concluded an acquisition that expanded its positions and operations in Texas into the Midland Basin, a subsection of the larger Permian. In January, the company closed on its previously announced deal with MPDC to acquire the Mascot project. The closing gave Northern a 39.958% working interest in the Mascot Project. Northern paid a total of $320 million in cash for the acquisition, which includes $43 million paid up front at the signing.Story continuesA quick look at the company’s latest earnings will show the extent of the growth, and the potential. Northern’s Q4 production averaged 78,854 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing a 23% year-over-year increase. Of that total, 59.5% was oil, and the remainder was a mix of natural gas and natural gas liquids. The company’s revenue for the period was $445.6 million, which exceeded expectations by $37.56 million. However, Northern fell short on the bottom-line, missing the predicted non-GAAP EPS of $1.63 by $0.20. The actual EPS for the period was $1.43.Northern reported a cash flow from operations of $234.4 million during the quarter, up 48% from the previous year. This figure includes a 23% year-over-year increase in free cash flow, which amounted to $87 million after accounting for changes in net working capital. Additionally, the company increased its revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion, further bolstering its overall liquidity.All of this backed up Northern’s ability to maintain its common share dividend. In its last declaration, Northern set the next dividend payment for April 28, at 34 cents per common share. This represents an increase of 13% from the prior payout, and the annualized rate of $1.36 per common share gives an above-average yield of 4.1%.Covering this stock for RBC, 5-star analyst Scott Hanold sees plenty of potential for Northern to return value to investors, writing: “NOG’s Permian position should gain significant scale through 2023 and along with its leading edge analytics enhance future growth opportunities. The company has diligently hedged and this should allow further enhancements to its shareholder returns… At strip commodity prices, we estimate a 5-6% annualized dividend yield.”In line with this outlook, Hanold rates NOG shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target, now set at $46, implies a one-year upside potential of 36%. (To watch Hanold’s track record, click here)The RBC view is hardly the only bullish take on NOG, as the stock has 9 recent analyst reviews on file – all positive, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently trading for $33.82 and their $47.11 average price target suggests a gain of 39% over the next 12 months. (See NOG stock forecast)Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)Next up is Marathon Oil, an industry leader sporting a $16 billion market cap and more than $7.5 billion in annual revenues. The company is a business descendant of Standard Oil, one of the oldest names in the North American oil industry, and in its current form embodies the hydrocarbon exploration and production (E&amp;P) arm of Marathon Petroleum, from which it spun off in 2011. Currently, Marathon operates in some of the richest oil and gas regions on the continent, including the Bakken of North Dakota and the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basins of Texas.Marathon operates as an independent E&amp;P firm, and its assets are well balanced, with a nearly 50-50 split between oil and natural gas. The Houston-based company has a record of generating strong profits and is committed to returning capital to shareholders. In addition to its US oil and gas plays, Marathon also operates a ‘well-integrated’ natural gas exploitation play in Equatorial Guinea.In its last quarterly financial report (4Q22), Marathon reported mixed headline numbers. The company’s revenue was $173 billion, which grew 3.75% year-over-year but missed the forecast by $40 million. On the other hand, the company’s non-GAAP EPS was 88 cents, up 11 cents year-over-year and 3 cents higher than expectations. Although the company’s net cash from operations in Q4 decreased slightly to $1.13 billion from $1.15 billion in the year-ago quarter, it still generated a free cash flow of $794 million for the quarter, underpinning Marathon’s ability to return capital to its shareholders.On that front, Marathon returned 55% of its FCF to shareholders in 2022 through a combination of share buybacks and dividend payments. The company spent $2.8 billion on buybacks for the full year, and its Q4 dividend payment of 10 cents per share, paid out in March, marked the seventh dividend increase in the last 10 quarters.This oil major has caught the eye of analyst Derrick Whitfield, of Stifel, who writes, “The company has delivered meaningful value (production growth, portfolio simplification, and free cash flow generation) for its investors since 2018. With an above-average 2023E FCF yield (16% versus a peer average of 12%), the company offers investors one of the most attractive return of capital profiles in the sector. Regarding long-term fundamentals, the company screens as second best on our seven variable quantitative analysis tool.”“Net net,” the analyst summed up “Marathon’s exceptional asset quality, balance sheet strength, and long-term upside leave us constructive on the stock.”Looking ahead, Whitfield gives Marathon a Buy rating, with a $37 price target to suggest a 44% upside potential for the coming year. (To watch Whitfield’s track record, click here)Overall, Marathon’s shares have a Moderate Buy rating from Wall Street’s analysts, based on 15 analyst reviews that include 12 Buys, 1 Hold, and 2 Sells. With a $25.66 current trading price and an average price target of $34.53, Marathon sports an upside potential of ~35% for the next 12 months.

The document doesn’t list the company’s purpose, and Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the existence of the entity.Musk has frequently publicly criticized OpenAI, the highest-profile AI startup. In February, tech news site the Information said that Musk had approached researchers about forming a new AI research lab to rival the ChatGPT and Dall-E creator. Igor Babuschkin, a former employee at Alphabet Inc.’s DeepMind, said that he and Musk had discussed putting together a team.The efforts could be part of Musk’s larger ambitions to create a superapp. The chief executive officer of Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter, has long talked about creating an “everything app” called X. He recently merged Twitter into a parent corporation called X Corp. He has said that the social network will be an “accelerant” for creating X.On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Musk is holding discussions with Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. investors about helping fund an AI startup, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.The billionaire has acquired thousands of processors from Nvidia Corp. for the new project, the paper said. That news helped boost shares of the chipmaker Friday, with the stock gaining as much as 1.6% following a decline earlier in the session.Story continuesDespite his work around AI, Musk was among a group of researchers and tech industry leaders that last month called for developers to pause the training of powerful AI models.He was also involved early on in the creation of OpenAI. Musk helped start the organization in 2015 and served as as co-chair along with Sam Altman, the current CEO. At the time, OpenAI’s goal was to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”Musk left OpenAI’s board in 2018 and has since criticized the organization, which created a for-profit arm in 2019. He has expressed worry that it was “training AI to be woke” and said it was “effectively controlled by Microsoft.” Microsoft Corp. has invested $10 billion into OpenAI.Altman, talking in a podcast about Musk’s concerns, called him a “jerk” while noting he believes Musk is “feeling very stressed about what the future’s going to look like for humanity.”(Updates with details on X.AI starting in the first paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmericans Go Deeper Into Debt as They Use Buy Now, Pay Later Apps for GroceriesThe Repo Man Returns as More Americans Fall Behind on Car PaymentsRepublicans Fight a Solar Boom That’s Made Texas King of Clean EnergySan Jose Plans Robocar Network Instead of Airport ShuttlePeople Are Using AI for Therapy, Even Though ChatGPT Wasn’t Built for It©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

What would cause you to switch your evaluation, to join the herds of bulls on Amazon?STEFAN SLOWINSKI: Yeah, look. I think Amazon will be successful with AI. If anything, they're one of the creators of that industry, having been using AI for 20 plus years, since they were invented. Obviously, Amazon web services has the capabilities. Just like Google, they have their own large language models. They have their own semiconductors. They're not necessarily reliant on external technology. And I think that they'll leverage that through AWS to make that available to their enterprise customers.I think that's what we saw them announce yesterday. We're not yet quite clear as to how Amazon is going to use generative AI in their own Amazon consumer services. So I still think that's to come. So this is an exciting space.I think Microsoft, through their OpenAI relationship; Google, just like Amazon, have their own capabilities; and Amazon will all be successful. But I think near-term, the market's focused on three things. One is, what's the cost? So we may not see revenue just yet, but will we see a tick up in CapEx as this move toward generative AI accelerates? And of course, for Amazon, people are sort of looking more for CapEx cuts and not CapEx increases.The second one is, what is the product opportunity? I think with Microsoft, people see Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, and some other announcements they've made of real opportunities near-term for them to begin to monetize it. We've seen some other partners, like Salesforce with their GPT offering, Intuit now with Mailchimp, looking to monetize this through products.And then the third, of course, is the platform opportunity, like I just mentioned with AWS, Google Cloud platform, Microsoft Azure, providing this technology to enterprise customers to bring their data onto their platforms, use these large language models to begin to train their own AI initiatives. So I think all three companies will be beneficiaries of that over time.]"

(NASDAQ:PAYX)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-paychex-inc-124348981.html,1681476228,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Key InsightsPaychex's estimated fair value is US$126 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$109 share price, Paychex appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value The US$122 analyst price target for PAYX is 3.0% less than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Paychex The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.83bUS$1.81bUS$2.08bUS$2.24bUS$2.40bUS$2.53bUS$2.64bUS$2.74bUS$2.82bUS$2.90bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.29%Est @ 4.32%Est @ 3.65%Est @ 3.17%Est @ 2.84% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.1%) = US$58bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$58b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$29bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$45b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$109, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Paychex as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.859. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PaychexStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Professional Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Sysco (NYSE:SYY), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Sysco, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$2.9b ÷ (US$22b - US$8.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Sysco has an ROCE of 21%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Sysco roceIn the above chart we have measured Sysco's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Sysco's ROCE Trend?Things have been pretty stable at Sysco, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. Although current returns are high, we'd need more evidence of underlying growth for it to look like a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Sysco is paying out 49% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesIn Conclusion...While Sysco has impressive profitability from its capital, it isn't increasing that amount of capital. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 37% to shareholders over the last five years. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Sysco does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those can't be ignored...Sysco is not the only stock earning high returns.

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which belongs to the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This agribusiness giant has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 24.33%.For the most recent quarter, ADM was expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, but it reported $1.93 per share instead, representing a surprise of 17.68%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.42 per share, while it actually produced $1.86 per share, a surprise of 30.99%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for ADM lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.ADM has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 25, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.65bUS$3.13bUS$2.83bUS$2.17bUS$2.12bUS$2.11bUS$2.11bUS$2.12bUS$2.14bUS$2.17bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.85%Est @ 0.03%Est @ 0.64%Est @ 1.07%Est @ 1.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$3.4kUS$2.7kUS$2.3kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$47bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$47b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$24bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$42b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$81.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Archer-Daniels-MidlandStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

This is because less attention in the dividend investing community can result in greater inefficiency in pricing. This often yields compelling buying opportunities.Popular dividend stocks are often popular for a reason: they generate consistent dividend growth and have generated impressive total returns for shareholders. However, looking  for under-the-radar stocks can often yield opportunities with superior dividend yields and even the possibility for outsized total returns.In this article, we will cover three under the radar high dividend stocks that combine attractive long-term total return potential with current dividend yields over 6%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe Western Union Company (WU)Logo/electronic sign for Western Union (WU)Source: 360b / Shutterstock.comThe Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) is a global leader in domestic and international money transfers. It boasts a network of approximately 550,000 agents in over 200 countries. The company operates in three business segments, with the majority of revenue coming from consumer-to-consumer transfers. In 2019, Western Union divested its Speedpay and Paymap businesses. The company generated approximately $4.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022.Western Union has a competitive advantage in the C2C business and a strong network of agents for transaction processing. It has also partnered with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and has digital money transfer efforts. However, new online competitors are entering the market, which may negatively affect Western Union’s C2C business through lower volumes.Western Union’s C2C business is mature but profitable, with a volatile top line due to acquisitions and divestitures. Earnings per share have benefited from significant share buybacks, but revenue and earnings have been negatively impacted by Covid-19 and competition, resulting in a decline in earnings per share. Digital money transfer has been growing rapidly. However, it is expected to level off, with revenue from it accounting for 25% of total C2C revenue. The dividend will likely remain constant with no growth out to 2028.Story continuesWith an 8.5% dividend yield, a forecasted 0% earnings per share compound annual growth rate (CAGR), and a probable 5.5% annualized tailwind from valuation multiple expansion, WU could deliver exceptional 14% annualized total returns over the next half decade.Antero Midstream Corporation (AM)Big industrial oil tanks in a refinery base. Oil stocks., CEI stockSource: OlegRi / ShutterstockAntero Midstream (NYSE:AM) is a midstream company that may be considered small in comparison to larger industry players. Its pipeline network spans just a few hundred miles with a sole client in Antero Resources (AR). Nevertheless, its assets boast a multi-decade production profile that provides stability, and it shares a strong economic alignment with AR, providing reassurance to shareholders. Furthermore, AR is making quick progress in reducing its debt. It is also poised to attain an investment-grade credit rating from S&amp;P, which will greatly enhance AM’s risk profile.AM is focused on paying down debt aggressively as its growth capex declines and new projects come online, resulting in strong free cash flow. It aims to achieve credit-rating upgrades, target a 3x leverage in 2024, and consider growing its dividend per share or buy back shares. With no debt maturing before 2026, AM is in a good position to deleverage and create long-term shareholder value.AM has indicated to investors that it won’t increase its dividend this year and maybe not next year. This is because it anticipates reaching its long-term leverage target only by the end of 2024. However, with the dividend covered 1.69x by distributable cash flow in 2023 and an expected increase in discounted cash flow (DCF) per share due to interest expense reduction and organic growth, the dividend may see significant growth once the leverage target is met.With an 8.6% dividend yield, a forecasted -2.6% earnings per share CAGR, and an expected 0.5% annualized headwind from valuation multiple contraction, AM is poised to deliver mediocre 5.5% annualized total returns over the next half decade. However, its dividend is very attractive and looks quite safe at the moment.Xerox (XRX)A photo of the Xerox logo on a storefront.Source: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterStock.comXerox (NASDAQ:XRX) is a workplace technology company founded over a century ago. It offers business solutions such as printers, digital services for workflow automation and content management solutions. It has diversified over time by adding software and services segments through organic expansion and acquisitions. In fact, non-equipment revenues now contribute to the majority of its sales. The company is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut.Although Xerox is not in a fast-growing industry, it should deliver meaningful EPS growth over the next five years. Its margins will likely expand due to inflationary pressures easing and the company raising prices for customers. Sales are not expected to grow dramatically, as most of its sales come from existing customers. Xerox can return most of its cash flows to its owners through dividends and share repurchases since it does not need to invest heavily in new production capacity. Share repurchases have reduced the company’s share count, almost doubling each share’s portion of the company’s net profits.Xerox’s healthy balance sheet with no net core debt enables meaningful shareholder returns. And the company is expected to deliver up to 9% EPS growth annually through margin normalization and buybacks. EPS will likely increase to $2 by 2028.Xerox operates in a slow-growing industry with established players, including Xerox itself, controlling the market. Xerox has the advantage of a globally diversified customer base and a focus on document management systems. Its healthy balance sheet is also a competitive advantage. However, Xerox has not fully capitalized on these advantages. Its margins and return on capital are not particularly attractive, and its operating margin is only in the mid-single digits.With a 6.95% dividend yield, a forecasted 9% earnings per share CAGR, and an expected 2% annualized headwind from valuation multiple contraction, XRX is poised to deliver attractive 13.95% annualized total returns over the next half decade along with a very attractive dividend.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis hospital operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.2%.Revenues are expected to be $15.3 billion, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.03% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for HCA?For HCA, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that HCA will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that HCA would post earnings of $4.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.64, delivering a surprise of -3.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.HCA doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors are constantly being reminded of this average. It's like a barometer. It's like a snapshot of the stock market. But what exactly is it? The Dow is composed of 30 American companies, and it's supposed to be representative of the overall market and most of the big sectors of the economy.Taking a look at the Dow components, you can see it includes some technology stocks. You've got Apple. Microsoft is in there. You have some financial stocks, like JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs. You've got health care stocks like UnitedHealth Group, Boeing, an industrial stock. And then some consumer facing stocks as well, like Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Walmart is in there.Now, the Dow is a price weighted index. A company's weight on the index is determined by the stock price. So UnitedHealth Group has the highest stock price among the components. Goldman Sachs is the second highest, followed by Home Depot. So when those stocks move up or down, they have a bigger impact on the overall point index movement.Now, the Dow, though, isn't technically an average. To get an average, you need to add up all the share prices and divide that by 30. But keep in mind, companies do stock splits and have dividends. So nowadays, the sum of the stock prices is divided by what's called a Dow divisor. And it's a number which changes frequently, and it takes into account stock splits and dividends. Fun fact-- no stock has been in the average for the entire lifespan of the Dow. The components change over the years as the economy changes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is more than 125 years old.DAVE BRIGGS: Excellent breakdown, Ines Ferre. Thanks so much. Enjoy the weekend.INES FERRE: You, too.]"

Argenti, who according to his Linkedin profile was hired by Goldman Sachs in 2019 after six years as a vice president of technology at Amazon Web Services, is a member of Goldman's management committee.Argenti also likened the advent of powerful generative artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT to the invention of the printing press, and predicted the technology will transform how businesses store and organize institutional knowledge, according to the email. He also raised the question of whether A.I. could make rising inequality worse.Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Argenti’s message.Printing pressIn the email, Argenti said that while others have said generative A.I. will be more impactful than the discovery of fire, the debut of the internet, or the move to cloud computing, he believed that a better analogy is the invention of the printing press, which had the effect of both democratizing access to knowledge as well as massively accelerating the codification of knowledge.Argenti said that while “efficiency gains are capturing a lot of the mindshare” he believed “LLMs are a breakthrough in knowledge more than they are in productivity.” He said this was similar to what happened when the printing press made books must cheaper and faster to produce. LLM is an acronym for large language models—the A.I. systems that encode the statistical connections between words and phrases learned from vast amounts of human text—that underpin chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s new Bing chat, Google’s Bard, and a half dozen others.Story continuesIn the letter, Argenti argues that LLMs represent a breakthrough in knowledge dissemination by eliminating barriers to understanding complex subjects. With LLMs, users can adjust the level of detail and complexity that the LLM produces, making knowledge more accessible and comprehensible, he said.'Tribal' knowledgeArgenti broached the idea that Goldman might train its own “ChatGS” LLM on all of the knowledge the company possess and which could then help users find and surface that knowledge in the format that would be most useful for them.The Goldman CIO said that the problem with any large corporation today is that a lot of critical knowledge resides only in the brains of its employees. “Within a corporation, most knowledge is not codified. It's tribal,” Argenti wrote. “It resides in the minds of ‘experts,’ connected by an internal social network that takes years to master.” That knowledge can also be lost if one of those key experts leaves the company. Argenti postulates that a “ChatGS” system could help Goldman breakdown these knowledge silos and ensure that vital information was recorded, stored, and accessible.In the message, Argenti also touched on concerns about the downsides of generative A.I., including the idea that A.I. could pose an existential threat to humanity and whether research into more powerful A.I. should be paused to give society and government regulators a chance to grapple with the implications of the new technology. He also broached the idea that the efficiency gains from powerful A.I. could make inequality worse than it already is. But Argenti did not offer his personal take on these pressing issues. Instead, he asksed a series of rhetorical questions.“In this particular moment, one of the greatest unknowns, and risks, for humanity lies in the answer to the following questions: would AI increase or close the societal gap?” he wrote. “Would it pose a threat to the very existence of humankind as we know it? Should we give ourselves time to reflect before we push ahead at full speed?”Argenti then concludes the letter with the idea that the democratization of knowledge from LLMs “would sway the pendulum in a benign and desirable direction of a better, fairer world.”CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images (Future Publishing via Getty Images)Corporate knowledge basesThe idea of corporate knowledge bases, knowledge graphs, and other software-enabled “knowledge management systems,” not dissimilar to what Argenti is suggesting LLMs will enable, enjoyed a brief heyday in the late 1990s, shortly after graphical web browsers spurred the internet boom. It was during this period that many companies created corporate “intranets” to supposedly codify and store knowledge. But many of these corporate knowledge management systems never lived up to their promise, in part because they were often difficult to search—it was often easier to just walk down the hall and ask the internal expert or send them an email—and even more difficult to keep up-to-date.The same statistical encoding process that underpins LLMs can be used to create “vector databases” that allow people to find information without having to search for exact keywords. That could solve the search issue that sank many corporate knowledge graphs. But it does not solve the problem of how to get the knowledge out of people’s heads and written down in the first place so that an LLM can be used to encode it. Most experts are too busy doing their day jobs to stop and write down step-by-step instructions or explanations for much of what they do. And some expertise is based on intuition, built over years of experience, that can be difficult to articulate.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +79.4%.Revenues are expected to be $7.53 billion, up 26.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.41% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger?For Schlumberger, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.69%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Schlumberger will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.71, delivering a surprise of +2.90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

(NYSE:AIG) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-market-wrong-american-international-110051466.html,1681556451,STORY,['AIG'],"[With its stock down 20% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard American International Group (NYSE:AIG). But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study American International Group's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for American International Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for American International Group is:27% = US$11b ÷ US$42b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.27 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.American International Group's Earnings Growth And 27% ROETo begin with, American International Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, American International Group's exceptional 61% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that American International Group's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 15% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is AIG fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is American International Group Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?American International Group's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 9.7%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 90% of its profits. So it looks like American International Group is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Besides, American International Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 20% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 10% over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that American International Group's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

The company’s solid prospects in the blood typing market raise optimism. A strong solvency position continues to favor the stock.Let’s take a quick look at the important catalysts to understand this positive trend.Key Growth CatalystsFocus on International Markets: Bio-Rad has been deriving more than 60% of its net sales from international markets. The company experienced double-digit currency-neutral core revenue growth in the Americas and Asia year over year. Europe posted a more modest increase, primarily reflecting ongoing supply chain constraints for diagnostic products. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group’s currency-neutral core revenues rose in the Americas year over year. Within Clinical Diagnostics, currency neutral full-year core revenues grew in the Americas and Europe.Solid Prospects in the Blood Typing Market: Bio-Rad offers a broad range of platforms, reagents, data management and connectivity solutions to cater to various blood typing demands, offering efficient and reliable results for blood grouping, phenotyping, crossmatching, antibody screening and identification, direct antiglobulin tests, and single antigen typing. The company has also been actively expanding its portfolio for the blood typing market. The company currently offers products like IH-500 and IH-1000.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAccording to the latest report by Reports and Data, the global blood group typing market size is expected to reach $6.18 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 10.1%. Taking this into account, we view the developmental steps undertaken by the company as progressive and strategically aligned.Strong Solvency and Balance Sheet: Bio-Rad exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of 1.79 billion compared with $875.5 million at the end of 2021. Total debt (including current maturities) at the end of 2022 was $1.19 billion compared with $11 million at the end of 2021.This figure is lower than the quarter-end cash and cash equivalent and investments level, indicating strong solvency. This is good news in terms of the solvency position of the company, at least during the economic downturn, implying that the company is holding sufficient cash for debt repayment.Story continuesFavorable ParametersFor 2023, Bio-Rad has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.17%. Meanwhile, revenues are expected to grow 10.33% on a year-over-year basis.Bio-Rad has a current ratio of 5.55 compared with the industry’s 2.28.

The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 11% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 11.9%. Merit Medical’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerit Medical is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and potential in its Cardiovascular unit are expected to contribute. However, stiff competition and higher consolidation in the healthcare industry persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversStrong Product Portfolio: Merit Medical has continued to gain significant momentum on the back of new products and is upbeat about the product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products, raising investors’ optimism. The company has several electrophysiology products that are either on track for release or in several others in stages of development.In March, Merit Medical announced the expansion of its SwiftNINJA Steerable Microcatheter product line, which belongs to its delivery systems portfolio.Potential in Cardiovascular Unit: Investors are optimistic about the unit’s robust potential. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Merit Medical witnessed a solid uptick in its Cardiovascular unit’s year-over-year revenues on a reported and at constant exchange rate, organic basis. Revenues in the unit’s majority of the product categories, Peripheral Intervention, Cardiac Intervention and Original Equipment Manufacturer, were also robust during the fourth quarter.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: Merit Medical’s robust fourth-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company’s year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines was impressive. Robust performances in the United States and outside were impressive. Strong execution and improving customer demand trends pushed up the overall top line, which was encouraging. The company stands to benefit from the execution of its global growth and profitability plan.DownsidesHigher Consolidation in the Healthcare Industry: Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. Thus, to provide healthcare solutions at a cheaper rate and eradicate competition, large-cap MedTech behemoths have started consolidating with mid-cap and small-cap companies. This enables the availability of healthcare products at low prices in the market. Per management, such trends compel Merit Medical’s customers to ask for price concessions on its products, which acts against its ongoing business strategies. This may also exert a solid downward pressure on the prices of Merit Medical’s products and reduce the customer base.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources and market presence. The company competes globally in several market areas, including radiology, diagnostics and interventional cardiology. Such resources and market presence may enable the competitors to market competing products more efficiently or at reduced prices to gain market share.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

However, a challenging pricing scenario that continues to plague Globus Medical is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Globus Medical exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with an earnings beat. The robust growth of organic revenues in both the United States and the international market is impressive. Rapid market interest and customer demand have positioned Excelsius3D, the company’s latest addition to the Excelsius Ecosystem, as a major growth driver in 2023. The company delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in the Trauma business, with 70% growth in the reported quarter. Internationally (excluding Japan), Globus’ spinal implant business also delivered double-digit growth in most markets.Higher net sales and the acquisition of in-process research and development contributed to the quarter’s GAAP net income, which increased 231.4% from the prior-year quarter figure.Globus Medical and NuVasive (NUVA) are currently planning to combine in an all-stock transaction to create a global musculoskeletal company focused on rapid innovation, addressing unmet clinical needs and improving offerings to surgeons and patients.Globus Medical, Inc. PriceGlobus Medical, Inc. PriceGlobus Medical, Inc. price | Globus Medical, Inc. QuoteThe combined company expects to bring best-in-class technologies to create a differentiated and comprehensive procedural solution offering as part of its approach to address unmet clinical needs and support surgeons and patients. According to Globus Medical, both companies’ operational footprints are highly complementary, allowing them to better leverage each other's manufacturing and supply chain resources to increase internal production while reducing the amount of capital investment required as stand-alone. This way, they can redirect investment and improve cash flow.On the flip side, Globus Medical exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with a revenue miss. Escalating costs are building pressure on the gross margin. The Q4 gross margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) to 74.3% due to a product mix and higher freight costs. SG&amp;A expenses in the reported quarter were up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Selling costs increased due to high compensation expenses from recruiting and mounting traveling expenses.Story continuesThe continued impact of non-operating headwinds is a major downside.We note that the musculoskeletal devices industry is characterized by intensifying competitive pricing pressure. Pricing continues to remain a major headwind for Globus Medical. We remain concerned about the pricing scenario as it will be affected by cost-containment efforts by governmental healthcare, local hospitals and health systems.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The company’s favorable demographic trend and strategic acquisitions undertaken also encourage us. However, reimbursement headwinds and competitive challenges remain. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Amedisys ended the fourth quarter with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The Contessa Health acquisition seems to be strategically aligned with Amedisys’ business, which experienced positive momentum in the fourth quarter, offering home-based recovery solutions to patients needing acute care. In 2023, Amedisys remains confident about generating approximately $50 million in revenues from Contessa Health, the company’s newly formed high-acuity segment, driven by increased volumes from their current and signed JV partners.Amedisys is currently focusing on improving clinical quality. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) April 2023 preview reports show that the Quality of Patient Care star average across all Amedisys providers was 4.49, with 99% of its care centers at 4+ stars and 46 care centers rated at five stars. Amedisys’ Patient Satisfaction star average for the January 2023 release was 3.57, outperforming the industry average by 1%. On the fourth quarter-2022 earnings call, the company noted that its patient satisfaction remains greater than 85%.Amedisys is developing and acquiring new business lines that will complement its existing home care and hospice business and help seniors manage their health more effectively and stay in their homes longer.Amedisys, Inc. PriceAmedisys, Inc. PriceAmedisys, Inc. price | Amedisys, Inc. QuoteIn February 2023, Amedisys entered into a new agreement with BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee to provide members in Middle Tennessee with palliative care in the comfort of their homes. With this program, BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee’s members can receive palliative care in-person or via telehealth from Amedisys’ clinicians, including doctors, nurse practitioners and nurses at no additional cost.In the same month, Amedisys entered into a definitive agreement to divest its Personal Care division to HouseWorks, LLC. Per management, this divestiture allows the company’s personal care division to grow under a proven leader in the industry while Amedisys focuses its attention on the core business units of Home Health, Hospice and High Acuity Care.Story continuesOn the flip side, during the fourth quarter of 2022, Amedisys registered a year-over-year decline in the Hospice segment’s revenues, which does not bode well. For the company, dealing with the continuous shortage of clinical labor, nursing in particular, has been challenging.Mounting costs and expenses and the contraction in adjusted operating margin are other downsides. Amedisys’ expenses on salaries and benefits rose 5.5% and Other expenses rose 13.3%. Adjusted operating profit reflected a 17.7% decline from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin contracted 205 bps to 9.3% from the prior-year level.On Oct 31, 2022, CMS issued the Home Health Final Rule for Medicare home health providers for 2023. CMS estimates that the final rule will result in a 0.7% increase in payments to home health providers. Per Amedisys’ management analysis of the final rule, the company expects its impact to be flat, which is less than the estimated 0.7% rate increase.In the past year, Amedisys has underperformed the industry it belongs to. Per the last trading price, the stock has declined 48.1% compared with a 14.8% decline of the industry.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Notably, egg prices continued to pull back, as Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reported. Love to see it.Yet, a consumer sentiment report on Friday that showed inflation expectations ratcheting higher scrambled the inflation outlook. Gas prices that are up 17 cents nationwide from a month ago will do that.Meanwhile, billionaire Warren Buffett waxed poetic about the investing opportunities in Japan just weeks away from his closely watched Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting.Then there was the start of earnings season with results out of big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Blackrock (BLK), and PNC (PNC). Investors mostly rewarded the quarters despite bank execs warning of economic storm clouds and more fallout from the March industry turmoil that led to the downfall of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.""Higher for longer [rates] comes with a lot of other things attached to it, like maybe a recession, stagflation, or lower volumes,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts on an earnings call.And in the end, all three major US stock market indexes finished the week with gains.All of this feverish activity likely means you missed a few things in markets this week. More on that below!A stock trader monitors share prices at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, October 27, 2020. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach10 Things You Missed in Markets This Week1. A financial warning: The Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein told Yahoo Finance Live there is a ""hole"" in the financial statements of First Republic Bank (video above). He also said he will be interviewing Kim Kardashian soon as part of his popular interview show.Story continues2. Good point on mixed economic data: ""The problem for many investors right now is that it’s still possible to construct fairly divergent narratives about the economy depending on which series you look at,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.""On the one hand, an array of leading indicators are pointing to a U.S. recession over the coming year, in line with our own house view at Deutsche Bank Research,"" Reid added. ""But if you wanted to take the opposite view, you could point to unemployment around its lowest in decades, a high level of vacancies by historic standards, financial markets that have mostly shrugged off the SVB-related turmoil by now, along with growing signs that inflation is softening and the Fed are nearing a pause in their rate hikes.""3. More earnings on the way: “We're bullish on Netflix into 1Q23 results as we think management will be optimistic on the lift to the P&amp;L [profit and loss] from paid sharing implementation,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall.4. Shiny gains: Gold prices (GC=F) are a stone's throw away from the summer 2020 record highs of $2,075 an ounce. Gold prices are up 13% year to date as investors seek out safe-haven investments post-banking-industry turmoil.5. Building declines: Mortgage rates have declined for five straight weeks.

Still recession spotting: Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a new client note that there is still a 35% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. On the positive side, there is a 65% chance there won't be a recession in the next 12 months.8.

Arnault is worth a cool $210 billion, up $48 billion year to date. Musk is worth $180 billion.10. Dr. Doom speaks out: Nouriel Roubini, better known as ""Dr. Doom"" for his dire economic predictions, told Yahoo Finance Live the current banking industry turmoil will exacerbate a ""credit crunch,"" in which loans are harder to find due to more scrutiny and a risk-off environment.""That credit crunch is gonna tip the U.S. economy into recession later this year,"" Roubini warned.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The service offers more popular franchises like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and DC.He looks to upgrade the user interface and personalize recommendations. He wants people to use it like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).Zaslav aimed to convince the world that his company was due for a revival.Zaslav remains optimistic about 2023 after battling a rough 2022 when he restructured the company, fired thousands of employees, and dumped dozens of projects.The stock gained 47.2% YTD after losing 43.6% last year.Zaslav's film business desperately needs to return to pre-pandemic ticket sales, and his TV networks need more revenue from a shrinking subscriber base.Unless he splurges more in video games, his most significant growth opportunity is still streaming.HBO Max's subscriber base trails Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) Disney+, Amazon.Com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Hulu.U.S. viewers spend almost six times as many hours watching Netflix as HBO Max.

Sales are expected to be up 4% at $8.18 billion Vs. $7.87 billion in Q1 2022.The dip in Netflix’s YoY quarterly bottom line is attributed to the launch of its paid-sharing service which will allow a paying subscriber to add one “extra member” to their profile. This deployment was issued to lower the usage of password sharing to multiple non-paying members with Netflix hoping it will add back to its earnings and revenue in the long haul.Earnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates that Netflix could slightly miss Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate at $2.79 per share and roughly 1% below the Zacks Consensus.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSubscriber GrowthDespite the possibility of missing EPS expectations, Netflix stock can largely thrive on increasing subscriber numbers as it shows the ability of the company to retain members and grow going forward.Netflix’s performance after its quarterly reports can largely depend on its subscriber growth more so than its top and bottom line results. This is especially true with the company facing increased streaming competition from Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA), and Apple (AAPL).To what would be a delight for investors, Netflix is forecasted to have added up to 3.71 million subscribers during Q1. This is compared to a loss of -200,000 subscribers in the same period last year which was the company’s first quarterly membership loss in over a decade. Still leading the streaming space, Netflix is now expected to have around 234.71 million subscribers a 1% increase from last quarter and year-end 2022.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; ValuationNetflix stock is +15% year to date to match the Nasdaq and its main streaming competitor Disney’s performances while topping the S&amp;P 500’s +8%. Netflix shares have now rallied 38% over the last six months to largely outperform Disney’s +2% and the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of NFLX trade at $337 per share and 30.9X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high of 513.4X and 71% beneath the median of 106X. While Netflix does trade above its industry average of 12.4X, Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company's grwoth prospects as a leader and pioneer in its space.Furthermore, with its P/E valuation more attractive relative to its past its noteworthy that Netflix is now trading closer to Disney’s 25.3X forward earnings.Outlook Netflix earnings are expected to jump 12% this year and climb another 26% in fiscal 2024 at $14.18 per share. However, earnings estimate revisions have started to decline over the last 30 days. On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 8% in FY23 and rise another 11% in FY24 to $38.06 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineGong into its Q1 report Netflix stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While the recent decline in earnings estimate revisions is somewhat concerning, Netflix’s annual top and bottom line growth is still expected to be strong over the next few years.With that being said, first-quarter results and guidance will need to help reaffirm this and show that Netflix has the ability to continue expanding its subscriber base despite increasing competition from Disney and others. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As always, earnings results and guidance will be critical in determining the state of the broader economy, and how investors decide to position their portfolios.So far, 2023 has been unexpectedly good for most stocks. Many market participants came into the year expecting a recession, and another challenging year for the equity market, but that hasn’t materialized.Because the performance of the technology sector has been so strong this year, earnings reports from the tech giants are going to be front and center. Will they be able to show strong earnings and rally further? Or are earnings going to be a sell the news event.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNext week we will see earnings reports from Netflix NFLX, Tesla TSLA, Lam Research LRCX, and Taiwan Semiconductor TSM.Also getting a lot of attention this earnings season will be bank stocks. After the Silicon Valley Bank debacle, investors are going to want to know how the other regional and national banks are faring in this new higher interest rate environment.Earnings for Charles Schwab SCHW, State Street STT, Bank of America BAC, and Morgan Stanley MS will be closely scrutinized. There is also a litany of smaller financial institutions reporting next week.Friday morning, we got the first preview of bank earnings. JP Morgan JPM and Citibank C both beat earnings expectations. JPM surprised to the upside by 20%, while C beat by 12%.TeslaTesla has been a huge winner in 2023 up 49% YTD. Yet analysts don’t have high expectations for earnings growth. Current quarter sales are expected to grow 25% YoY to $24 billion, but earnings are projected to contract -21% to $0.85 per share.During its last reporting period Tesla beat earnings expectations by 9%, so it will be interesting to see if these lowered estimates help it edge out another beat. Zacks Earnings ESP projects a -1.7% miss for the electric car manufacturer. TSLA reports Wednesday after the market close.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNetflixNetflix stock has had a decent year to date performance, although quite volatile. After being up 25% in January, the stock tanked to a negative performance. It has rallied considerably since the banking crisis though and is now up 15% YTD.With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), analysts have mixed expectations for earnings. Sales are expected to grow 4% YoY to $8.2 billion, but earnings are expected to shrink 20% YoY to $2.81 per share. Last quarterly report NFLX did awfully, and missed earnings estimates by -75%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s worth noting that Netflix valuation is as appealing as it has been in a long time. Trading at 31x earnings it is well below its five-year median of 64x. In 2022 NFLX experienced a -75% drawdown, which is what brought its valuation to the level it is today. NFLX reports Tuesday after the market close.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBank of America and Goldman SachsTuesday morning, we will see earnings reports from Bank of America and Goldman Sachs GS. Both have put up lackluster returns YTD, and neither have strong earnings expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalysts have unanimously downgraded BAC earnings expectations across timeframes. Current quarter earnings expectations have been lowered by nearly -4% over the last 60 days. Last quarter, Bank of America beat estimates by 12%, but the Zacks ESP is projecting a -1.7% miss.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGoldman Sachs estimates aren’t any better. Sales are expected to stagnate YoY, while earnings are projected to be down -24% YoY to $8.14 per share. EPS have been collapsing over the past two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionIt should be a busy and interesting start to the earnings season next week.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.21%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.42%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.64%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the oil refiner had gained 11.8% over the past month. This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 6.61% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.71% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Phillips 66 as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 3, 2023. On that day, Phillips 66 is projected to report earnings of $3.74 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 183.33%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $32.32 billion, down 11.99% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $15.96 per share and revenue of $132.93 billion, which would represent changes of -15.06% and -24.35%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Phillips 66. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Front-month gas futures for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) rose 10.7 cents, or 5.3%, to settle at $2.114 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). The contract has risen 5.2% so far this week, after dropping 9.2% last week. ""There's a lot of fundamental and technical support around the $2.00 mark so any positive news coming out of the weather outlooks which shifted slightly cooler and we're up,"" said Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy. Data provider Refinitiv forecast that U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 93.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week to 94.8 bcfd next week. However, ""the market is also keeping an eye on outages at some of the LNG terminals. That's certainly going to help pull gas demand back here"" Cunningham said. Refinitiv estimated that average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states has risen to 100.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in April, up from 98.7 bcfd in March. That compares with a monthly record of 100.4 bcfd in January 2023. Prices fell 4% in the last session. For the week, prices are up about 5.2% so far. ""We are maintaining a view that a $1 price handle will prove too tempting for well-capitalized major hedge accounts or funds to ignore with some scale-down speculative buying likely especially if export demand improves and gas production further stalls,"" Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note. Refinitiv estimated 117 heating degree days (HDDs) over the next two weeks in the Lower 48 U.S. states. Those forecasts were higher than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday. HDDs estimate demand to heat homes and businesses by measuring the number of degrees a day's average temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday utilities put a near-normal 25 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas into storage last week. That compares with an 8 bcf injection during the same week a year ago and a five-year (2018-2022) average rise of 28 bcf.

Oil, gas’ main ingredient, accounts for more than half the price of a gallon of gas.Though a gallon of gas is still 41 cents less than a year ago, analysts warn prices still have room to rise in the near-term and put a crimp in people’s budgets.“Consumers confronted by inflated prices for basic necessities will now have to spread their budgets even more thinly,” International Energy Agency (IEA) said in an oil outlook on Friday. “This augurs badly for the economic recovery and growth.”Gas price prediction: Gas prices are down but projected to rise again. How much will gas cost in 2023?Why are oil (and gas) prices rising?Oil prices initially got a boost earlier in April after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries surprisingly announced it would cut production starting in May by 1.66 million barrels per day.On Friday morning, oil rose further after IEA predicted global oil demand will climb by 2 million barrels a day this year to a record 101.9 million barrels per day, “buoyed by a resurgent China.” It estimates 90% of the growth in oil demand will come from China.In the U.S., refineries also are performing routine spring maintenance and transitioning to producing summer gas, which temporarily constricts supply and boosts prices. Summer gas produces less emissions and is more expensive to produce, whereas cheaper winter gas ignites more easily to start your car in cold temperaturesWarm weather usually draws out more drivers, too, boosting demand for gas.All these factors helped pushed America’s West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices to a four-month high around $83 per barrel on Friday.“When the cost of crude oil crosses the $80 a barrel mark, that puts a lot of upward pressure on what we pay at the pump,” said Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson.Story continuesGreen energy: Biden boosts clean energy in coal country despite facing pushback from Congress on climateRisky cheap gas move: Cheaper gas in the Midwest could actually be over a billion dollar risk for some statesGas prices are displayed at a Mobil gas station in Prospect Heights, Ill., Sunday, Jan. 29, 2023.How high will gas prices rise?No one expects average nationwide gas prices to challenge last June’s record $5.016 per gallon, but analysts generally expect prices to continue ticking higher over the next couple of months.“$4.50 (per gallon) might be something we could see later this spring or summer, but it comes with huge uncertainty,” said Nikolai Roussanov, Wharton finance professor. “The economy is slowing. If the economy slows enough to reduce demand, then we won’t see gas prices go as high. I think gas will probably be somewhere between here and $4.50.”Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, expects gas prices to start sliding again in June.“Expect the upward trend to continue through much of the rest of spring, but once the transition to summer gasoline and refinery maintenance are behind us, April and May jumps could bring June slumps,” he said.

The virus is largely spread by wild birds that transmit it to poultry.The USDA is testing one vaccine from Zoetis Inc, one from Merck Animal Health, and two developed by the department's Agricultural Research Service.Zoetis said it previously supplied its vaccine to a USDA stockpile in 2016, following a massive 2015 outbreak, but it was never used.Initial data from a study using a single dose of a vaccine are expected in May, while results from studies on two-dose vaccine regimens are expected in June, the USDA said.If the trials are successful and USDA decides to continue development, it would take at least 18-to-24 months for a vaccine that matches the current virus to be commercially available, the agency said.The government needs to ensure vaccinations would not disrupt trading with major buyers, said Greg Tyler, president of the industry group USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council.Governments have previously focused on culling infected flocks to control the virus due to concerns importers would block shipments of vaccinated poultry to avoid the risk of infections.The USDA said on Friday its ""current strategy of stamping out and eradicating HPAI... continues to be the most effective strategy because it works.""France said last week it was launching an order for 80 million doses of vaccines to use in ducks in the autumn if final trial results are positive, the first EU member to start such a plan.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Clearway Energy CWEN, NextEra Energy NEE, Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. BEP and Vestas Wind Systems VWDRY.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Watch on the Path to Decarbonize the FutureAmid heightening climate concerns, the world is on a decarbonization mission. This has resulted in a significant shift toward renewable energy sources, which are becoming increasingly crucial in battling carbon emissions. Renewable energy offers a more sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels.The world is already seeing a significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and biomass. As society continues to change and adapt, alternative energy use will be more common, with many energy companies already shifting their focus to renewable energy in place of oil, coal and natural gas.This increasing adoption of renewable energy sources makes investing in renewable energy a promising option. Investors can consider adding stocks like Clearway Energy, NextEra Energy, Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. and Vestas Wind Systems.Rosy Prospects of the Renewable Energy MarketFactors like supportive government policies to encourage more renewable investments, plummeting cost of generating renewable electricity as well as rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EV) across the board are driving the renewable energy market. Renewable energy sources are not only cleaner than traditional fossil fuels but are also becoming more affordable and accessible.Governments are also actively focused on speeding up global decarbonization by passing aggressive climate legislation to increase investment in the clean energy sector. For instance, to fight the ongoing climate crisis and strengthen the U.S. energy infrastructure, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") entailed an investment of $369 billion over the next 10 years. The Climate Bill, part of IRA, is estimated to reduce the country's carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030.Story continuesClearly, the power sector is undergoing decarbonization, as a result of the significant expansion in wind and solar energy.  Per the latest report by clean energy think tank Ember, wind and solar hit a record 12% of global electricity last year. Per the report, the world's electricity emissions intensity reached its lowest level ever in 2022.The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that by 2025, renewable energy will account for around 35% of the world's electricity generation, rising from the current levels of around 29%. Per Allied Market Research, the global renewable energy market was valued at $881.7 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $1,977.6 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 8.4% from 2021 to 2030.Power a Safer Future by Investing in RenewablesInvesting in renewable energy is not just beneficial for the environment but can also be profitable. Renewable energy companies are typically involved in the production, distribution, and storage of energy from renewable sources. As the companies are often involved in multiple areas of the energy sector, it leads to portfolio diversification.Additionally, renewable energy firms are often subject to government incentives and subsidies, which can provide a stable and predictable source of revenues. Finally, the growth potential of renewable energy companies is massive as demand for renewable energy is only set to blossom, going forward. Thus, given the massive government investments and bright outlook for the alternative energy market, investing in renewable energy can fetch investors handsome rewards.4 Top Renewable Energy Stocks for a Sustainable TomorrowClearway along with its subsidiaries owns and operates a diverse portfolio of contracted renewable and conventional generation, along with thermal infrastructure assets in the United States.

A solid long-term growth prospect amid slow housing demand is also commendable.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve into the influencing factors of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Factors Supporting Growth TrajectorySolid Brands: Masco operates through various divisions with a large number of products. Its popular Behr brand is the number one brand in the do-it-yourself (DIY) market for architectural coatings. The PRO paint business within the Decorative Architectural segment continues to gain a significant share in the market. PRO, which accounts for one-third of its paint business, reported sales growth of more than 25% in 2022. Impressively, PRO paint has a three-year run rate of approximately 70%. Recently, Masco launched adjacent paint categories like aerosols, interior stains and caulks and sealants within PRO that are expected to add benefits in 2023. Delta also continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product categories and channels.Long-Term Growth Prospects: Masco expects solid growth in the long run, as it anticipates generating 3-5% average annual sales growth organically. The acquisitions are likely to contribute 1-3% yearly to sales. It anticipates approximately 10% average annual EPS growth, backed by a strong operating margin, expansion through cost productivity and volume leverage. This apart, it plans to return shareholders 1-2% above EPS growth via dividends and 2-4% through repurchases. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for long-term EPS growth is currently pegged at 4.9%.Cost-Saving Moves: Masco mainly focuses on business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch closures, improvements in the global supply chain and headcount reductions to improve profitability.

Selling, general and administrative expenses — as a percentage of net sales — declined 90 bps in 2022, backed by operating leverage and continued cost discipline across the businesses.Buyout Synergies: Masco believes in expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. In third-quarter 2021, the company’s Delta brand acquired a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products, namely Steamist, Inc. This complements Masco’s strong trade and e-commerce product offerings.Masco regularly divests its less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on its core areas to accelerate growth and improve shareholder value.

Market participants will try to analyze this reporting cycle against the backdrop of a possible recession later this year. Therefore, this season, management guidance and the near-term business outlook will get more importance than actual results. In addition to earnings and revenues, margins will get more attention from financial researchers.Bleak Outlook for Q1 Earnings SeasonAs of Apr 12, our estimates have shown that total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to be down 10% year over year on 1.7% higher revenues. This will follow a 5.4% year-over-year decline in earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index on 5.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2022. The aggregate EPS estimate for the S&amp;P 500 Index for fiscal 2023 has been steadily declining since Jun 15, 2022.This earnings season is likely to witness the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year decline in net margins of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The aggregate net margin is likely to decline 1.47% in Q1 2023. If this happens, it will mark the biggest quarterly decline since the 1.38% year-over-year net margin decline in Q4 2022.Stocks to WatchWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs that are set to report first-quarter 2023 earnings results next week. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a positive Earnings ESP.

108,67caa14e-56da-3daf-94fa-759d830600e2,SPGI,2023-04-15,American Airlines and Hertz Global have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-hertz-global-highlighted-122412116.html,1681475052,STORY,"['AAL', 'HTZ', 'PARR', 'SUN', 'SPGI', 'DNOW']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 14, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares American Airlines AAL as the Bull of the Day and Hertz Global HTZ as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NOW Inc. DNOW, Par Pacific Holdings PARR and Sunoco LP SUN.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The risk to reward is becoming favorable for American Airlines stock, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Furthermore, the Zacks Transportation-Airline Industry is in the top 13% of over 250 Zacks industries at the moment. Peak Travel Season Edging closer to the warmer months of the year, we are entering peak travel season and this should certainly give a boost to many airlines. There is also the possibility that travel will be higher in 2023 from lingering pent-up demand following the pandemic.In its latest data at the end of March, the U.S. Travel Associations' survey of travel spending totaled $93 billion in February which was 5% above 2019 pre-pandemic levels and 9% above 2022 levels.Plus, the Transportation Security Administrations' (TSA) checkpoint travel numbers have seen quite a few days spike above 2019 levels so far this month and are overall higher than last year.Earnings Estimate RevisionsIn correlation with the plausibility of higher travel demand, American Airlines' earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have now soared 32% over the last 90 days with FY24 EPS estimates rising 20%.American Airlines FY23 earnings are now forecasted to rebound and skyrocket 410% at $2.55 per share compared to EPS of $0.50 in 2022. Even better, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to climb another 24% at $3.16 per share.On the top line, sales are projected to jump 9% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 to $55.77 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would be 25% above 2019 pre-pandemic sales of $44.54 billion. This will certainly help the company's bottom line start to catch up as well.Story continuesAttractive Valuation Along with its post-pandemic growth recovery, American Airlines' valuation may be intriguing to investors right now with Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently announcing he will purchase a 51% stake in the company.News of Musk's majority interest in American Airlines surfaced at the beginning of the month. Although the Tesla boss jokingly stated he simply has an abundance of cash and likes buying companies with bird logos (Twitter) there is surely the factor of American Airlines price to earnings discount.American Airlines stock trades at just 5.1X forward earnings which is nicely beneath the industry average of 11.2X and the S&amp;P 500's 19X. Shares of AAL also trade 74% below their historical high of 21.1X since merging with U.S Airways in 2013. Plus, American Airlines stock trades at a 22% discount to its historic median of 6.9X.Bottom Line Now appears to be a great time to get in on American Airlines stock with earnings estimate revisions trending higher and shares still near 52-week lows at around $13 per share. The rising earnings estimates also make American Airlines P/E valuation very attractive and indicate its stock could indeed be vastly undervalued right now.It would be no surprise if American Airlines stock begins to fly this year with the Average Zacks Price Target suggesting 37% upside from current levels.Bear of the Day:Hertz Global currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with its Transportation-Services Industry in the bottom 15% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Investors may want to be cautious at the moment with Hertz not far removed from bankruptcy and facing increasing competition.Cautionary Tale Not that Hertz won't enjoy future success, but investors should be mindful that the company recently exited bankruptcy in July of 2021.After filing for Chapter 11, Hertz was delisted by the New York Stock Exchange in October 2020 but was relisted on the Nasdaq in November 2021. Hertz has a long history that dates back to 1918 with the company dominating the U.S. rental car industry for many years.However, the Covid-19 pandemic crippled the company as travel stopped and highlighted management's inability to preserve cash and an adequate balance sheet at the time. Compounding the challenges were Hertz's total liabilities which were at multi-year highs as shown in the nearby chart.Furthermore, with CFO Kenny Cheung recently leaving the company in late March there may be cause for concern. The company stated Cheung left for another professional opportunity in a different industry and has since appointed Chief Accounting Officer Alexandra Brooks as interim CFO.Growth &amp; CompetitionWhat also led to Hertz's trouble in recent years was increasing competition. After historically controlling the broader rental car industry, competitors like Avis Budget continued to expand while Hertz's shrank.Notably, Hertz's earnings estimate revisions have started to decline following its CFO's departure while Avis EPS estimates are rising. Hertz's earnings are now forecasted to drop -39% in fiscal 2023 at $2.27 per share compared to EPS of $3.74 in 2022. More concerning, fiscal 2024 EPS is expected to decline another -18%.Avis annual earnings are expected to experience a dip as well but the company's bottom line remains light years ahead of Hertz on top of CAR's earnings estimates soaring over the last quarter as shown in the chart below.This is indicative of Avis continuing to take market share. For now, Hertz declining earnings estimates may somewhat be symbolic of the company's inability to stop the bleeding.Bottom LineConsidering Hertz recently exited bankruptcy, the recent departure of its CFO may look like a red flag to many and investors will want to be cautious of HTZ stock as there could be more short-term weakness ahead.Reconfirming this possibility is the declining earnings estimates and Hertz's fall since relisting on the Nasdaq in 2021 could continue with shares of HTZ now down -40%.Additional content:U.S. Oil Prices Hit 2023 High: What's Driving the Market?U.S. oil prices moved up on Apr 12, hitting their highest level so far this year after government data showed a lower-than-expected weekly build in crude to go with the drop in gasoline and distillate supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures rose $1.73 (or 2.1%) to settle at $83.26 a barrel yesterday.Other factors driving the energy market are the recently announced surprise production cut by the OPEC+ cartel, hopes for an end to interest rate hikes following encouraging inflation data and potential refill to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (""SPR"") that could drain supplies.  Some oil-related stocks that could benefit in the current environment include NOW Inc., Par Pacific Holdings and Sunoco LP.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration's (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the holiday-shortened week ending Apr 7.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government's EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose 597,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 700,000-barrel increase per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of lower exports, higher production and a drop in refinery demand accounted for the stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer.Total domestic stocks now stand at 470.5 million barrels — 11.5% more than the year-ago figure and 3% higher than the five-year average.However, on a slightly bullish note, the latest report showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 409,000 barrels to 33.8 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover, at 30.2 days, remained unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 26.7 days.Let's turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the eighth time in as many weeks. The 330,000-barrel fall was primarily attributable to lower production. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would drop 900,000 barrels. At 222.2 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 4.7% less than the year-earlier level, while it is 7% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) dropped for the second week in succession. The 606,000-barrel decrease reflected lower production and a rise in exports. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of some 2 million barrels. Following last week's decline, current inventories — at 112.4 million barrels — are marginally below the year-ago level (by 0.9%) and 11% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 89.3%, edged down 0.3% from the prior week.Final WordEven as fears related to high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector over the past year. The space has generated a total return of around 12.1% in the trailing 12 months compared with the S&amp;P 500's decline of 6.9%.Apart from a relatively constructive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia's military operations in Ukraine. In March 2022, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Agreed, oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, However, the commodity still has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term, with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters' group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.While the banking sector turmoil did affect the sector temporarily, the crisis seems to have eased now. Crude also got a leg up and is now trading above $80 after U.S. Federal Reserve signaled an imminent end to interest rate increases, while the Biden Administration hinted at replenishing the SPR — a massive supply of government crude that is used in unforeseen circumstances — sometime this year.3 Stocks to BuyInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at NOW Inc., Par Pacific Holdings and Sunoco LP.

109,a140d492-2761-3fdc-b17d-61b6dad5513f,TSN,2023-04-15,Tyson Foods' (TSN) Capacity Expansions & Brand Portfolio Solid,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tyson-foods-tsn-capacity-expansions-154403624.html,1681487043,STORY,"['TSN', 'BYND', 'KMB', 'GIS']","[Focus on capacity-expansion endeavors is favoring Tyson Foods, Inc. TSN. The well-known leader in protein is well-placed to capitalize on the rising demand for protein-packed brands. These upsides fueled TSN’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 sales, which increased year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Let’s delve deeper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales Performance SolidIn the first quarter fiscal of 2023, Tyson Foods’ total sales came in at $13,260 million, up 2.5% from the $12,933 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Gains from the average price change were 1.7%, while total volumes rose 0.8%. Results gained from the company’s continued efforts to optimize its existing footprint, add new capacity and adjust the product mix while meeting customer and consumer needs effectively. The company’s retail channel drove $324 million of sales improvement led by Chicken and Prepared Foods. Its industrial and other channel sales grew $108 million, led by beef and chicken units.Factors Driving Tyson Foods GrowthThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is undertaking a number of operational and supply chain efficiency programs to place itself better in the long run. In this regard, the company is investing in capacity expansion and automation technology investments. Management continues accelerating digitalization via supply chain planning and execution processes to enhance customer service. It optimizes its plant network by adding fully cooked capacity, converting plants for value-added production, executing plant flexibility and enhancing the portfolio mix.Tyson Foods projects capital expenditures of nearly $2.5 billion for fiscal 2023. These include expenditures related to capacity expansion and utilization, automation to battle labor-related hurdles and product and brand innovation.Tyson Foods focuses on higher protein production to cater to the rising demand for protein-packed food. For fiscal 2023, the USDA projects domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) to be relatively flat from the fiscal 2022 levels. Management anticipates sales in the $55-$57 billion range in fiscal 2023, suggesting a 3-7% year-over-year growth. Per USDA forecasts, production in the Chicken segment will likely improve by nearly 3% in fiscal 2023. For the fiscal, the company expects better results from its foreign operations in the International/Other segment.In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it serves an estimated one-fifth of U.S. protein consumption. The company is well placed to cater to consumer’s steady protein demand, despite the tough macroeconomic environment and rising inflation. It remained the market share leader across most retail core categories in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company brands, including Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and BallPark continue to perform well. Tyson Foods boasts a rich portfolio of protein-packed brands that are growing rapidly across the globe.Story continuesWhat’s Hurting Tyson Food’s PerformanceIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Tyson Foods’ gross profit came in at $968 million, down from the $2,015 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The gross profit, as a percentage of sales, came in at 7.3%, down from the 15.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. Tyson Foods’ adjusted operating income plunged 68% to $453 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted to 3.4% from 11.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.That being said, the company is constantly looking for ways to improve cost structure, alongside achieving operational improvements and customer service. Starting from fiscal 2022, management launched a new productivity program to drive a better, faster and more agile organization. The company generated productivity savings of more than $700 million in fiscal 2022, which helped fight inflationary hurdles. The program is expected to generate savings of more than $1 billion by fiscal 2023, one year ahead of the original plan.TSN has dropped 0.9% year-to-date compared with the industry’s 5.3% decline.Solid Staple BetsSome better-ranked consumer staple stocks are General Mills GIS, Beyond Meat BYND and Kimberly-Clark Corporation KMB.General Mills, a branded consumer foods company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.1%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills’ current fiscal-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.3% and 7.4%, respectively, from the corresponding year-ago reported figures.Beyond Meat, which develops, manufactures, markets and sells plant-based meat products, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. BYND has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 29.3%, on average.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Beyond Meat’s current fiscal-year earnings suggests an increase of 39.7% from the year-ago reported number.Kimberly Clark is engaged in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of consumer products around the world. It currently has a Zacks Rank of 2. KMB has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.4%, on average.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kimberly Clark’s current financial year sales and earnings suggests growth of 1.7% and 5.2%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

110,c5c4a94a-7cbe-3f39-a905-e4cffd722481,SYF,2023-04-15,Can Higher Expenses Affect Synchrony's (SYF) Q1 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/higher-expenses-affect-synchronys-syf-152803942.html,1681486083,STORY,"['SYF', 'AON']","[Synchrony Financial SYF is set to report its first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 19, before the opening bell.The consumer financial services company reported adjusted earnings of $1.26 per share for the last quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.5% on the back of a rising loan receivables portfolio paving the way for higher interest and fees on loans. A growing purchase volume, resulting from increased contributions from its five sales platforms, also contributed to the upside. However, the quarterly results were partly offset by rising benchmark rates, elevated expenses and reduced average active accounts.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the first-quarter earnings announcement.What Do Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share of $1.50 suggests a 13.3% decrease from the prior-year reported figure of $1.73, while our estimate stands at $1.36. The consensus mark declined by a penny over the past week. The consensus estimate for first-quarter revenues of $4 billion indicates a 5.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure, while our estimate suggests 2.5% year-over-year growth.Synchrony beat the consensus estimate for earnings in all the prior four quarters, the average being 10.3%. This is depicted in the graph below:Synchrony Financial Price and EPS Surprise Synchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial price-eps-surprise | Synchrony Financial QuoteFactors to NoteSynchrony is expected to have benefited from higher purchase volume in the first quarter as consumer spending remained resilient to economic volatilities. Our estimate for total purchase volumes for the quarter under review indicates a year-over-year improvement of 9.8%. Moreover, we expect interest and fees on loans to have increased 10% year over year in the first quarter, boosting the top line.SYF is expected to have consistently gained from digital sales volume in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate suggest that the average active accounts in the Home &amp; Auto platform have risen 5.5% year over year in the first quarter.Story continuesThe financial service provider is expected to have witnessed an increase in Average Interest-Earnings Assets. The consensus estimate indicates a 9% increase in the metric from the year-ago period, while our estimate suggests a 4.6% jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the efficiency ratio is pegged at 35.43%, suggesting a decline from the prior-year reported figure of 37.20%.While the above-mentioned factors are likely to have benefited the company in the first quarter, some elements are anticipated to have offset the positives, leading to an earnings miss and a year-over-year decline. The company is expected to have incurred increased employee costs, information processing, and marketing and business development expenses in the first quarter.Our estimate for total non-interest expenses for the quarter indicates 8.5% year-over-year growth. Increased expenses are expected to have reduced the margins in the quarter under review.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the net interest margin is pegged at 15.4%, down from 15.8% a year ago, while our estimate suggests a net interest margin of 15.5%. The net charge-offs are likely to have significantly increased in the quarter in review.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Synchrony this time around.

Finally, it sent a message about accelerating renewable energy,"" Pannier-Runacher said.The G7 decided to endorse a goal to ""drastically increase electricity generated by renewable energies,"" a person with knowledge of the discussions separately told Reuters, asking not to be identified because the information is not public.Ministers also appeared to be considering numerical targets for increasing solar power capacity to at least 1 terawatt and offshore wind power capacity to 150 gigawatts by 2030, the source said.Energy-poor Japan was pushing for investments to stay for the gas industry in order to keep the liquefied natural gas in the energy mix as a transition fuel, winning some - but not all - support from the rest of G7.""The imperatives on gas supply are only short-term. This implicitly means that we cannot invest in the exploration of new gas capacity,"" Pannier-Runacher said, adding that nuclear energy is backed by G7 as a ""solution for the energy transition"" with security of supply.The event has also put focus on the need to help emerging countries reduce emissions, including through financing.Story continues""We, the G7, need to not only reduce our own emissions but also take concrete actions to achieve emission reductions globally,"" Japan's Economy and Trade Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said in his opening remarks, singling out countries in the ""Global South"".Nishimura said ministers would like to discuss ways to use finance to help reduce carbon in so-called ""hard-to-abate"" industries, which include chemicals, shipping and steel.""On climate finance, we must make a fairer deal for the 'Global South'"", said Sultan Al Jaber, the United Arab Emirates minister of industry and advanced technology, told a closed session, according to his remarks seen by Reuters.""Developed countries first need to follow through on the $100 billion pledge they made to developing countries over a decade ago.""'STRONGER LEADERSHIP'The issue of emissions in emerging markets has long been a focus for developed countries.

Europe now takes in only 8% of Russia's oil exports, per Kpler.""Both China and Russia are taking advantage of discounted Russian crude, benefiting from the sanctions applied on Russian materials by other countries,"" Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler, told Insider Friday.Behind China and India, Turkey and Bulgaria are the biggest buyers of Russian crude.Even before Vladimir Putin launched his war on Ukraine, China was already a top buyer of Russian crude, importing 25% of its crude from the country in 2021. That's since climbed to 36%, Kpler data shows.India, the world's third-largest oil importer, relied on Russia for about 1% of its total volumes prior to the war, but now buys 51% of its oil from Russia.The US has led Europe and other Western nations in imposing sanctions and energy price caps on Russia, designed to maintain market flows while curtailing Moscow's export revenue.Story continuesEuropean Central Bank calculations show trade volume between the euro area and Russia has halved since February 2022, with the bloc's imports of Russian imports seeing particularly steep declines following the bans on coal in August 2022, crude oil in December 2022, and refined oil products in February 2023.The ECB chart below shows a similar pattern illustrated in Kpler's data, with Russian seaborne crude exports shifting toward Asian buyers and away from Europe.European Central Bank, ECB Economic BulletinTo be sure, the revenue Russia generates from its energy exports has fallen along with the drop in prices, even as volumes remain elevated.The International Energy Agency said Friday that Moscow's revenue is down about 43% compared to the same time last year.But oil prices are heading back up as China's reopening economy drives demand while OPEC and Russia pinch supplies.Earlier this month, OPEC+ announced a surprise production cut of over 1 million barrels a day, with Russia extending its 500,000-barrel-a-day pullback through mid-2023.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

OPEC+ announced a surprise production cut earlier this month of over 1 million barrels a day. Russia, which is a member of OPEC+, said it would extend its cut of 500,000 barrels a day cut through mid-2023.""Our oil market balances were already set to tighten in the second half of 2023, with the potential for a substantial supply deficit to emerge.

Front-month gas futures for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) rose 10.7 cents, or 5.3%, to settle at $2.114 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). The contract has risen 5.2% so far this week, after dropping 9.2% last week. ""There's a lot of fundamental and technical support around the $2.00 mark so any positive news coming out of the weather outlooks which shifted slightly cooler and we're up,"" said Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy. Data provider Refinitiv forecast that U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 93.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week to 94.8 bcfd next week. However, ""the market is also keeping an eye on outages at some of the LNG terminals. That's certainly going to help pull gas demand back here"" Cunningham said. Refinitiv estimated that average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states has risen to 100.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in April, up from 98.7 bcfd in March. That compares with a monthly record of 100.4 bcfd in January 2023. Prices fell 4% in the last session. For the week, prices are up about 5.2% so far. ""We are maintaining a view that a $1 price handle will prove too tempting for well-capitalized major hedge accounts or funds to ignore with some scale-down speculative buying likely especially if export demand improves and gas production further stalls,"" Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note. Refinitiv estimated 117 heating degree days (HDDs) over the next two weeks in the Lower 48 U.S. states. Those forecasts were higher than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday. HDDs estimate demand to heat homes and businesses by measuring the number of degrees a day's average temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday utilities put a near-normal 25 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas into storage last week. That compares with an 8 bcf injection during the same week a year ago and a five-year (2018-2022) average rise of 28 bcf.

Here's what it means,USA TODAY,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1db970d6-0d94-3c53-b5e4-ae17473ca936/why-are-gas-prices-rising%3F.html,1681491091,STORY,['CL=F'],"[The weather is heating up, and so are gas prices.The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline rose eight cents since last week to $3.66 due to the rise in oil prices, nonprofit federation of motor clubs AAA said on Thursday. Oil, gas’ main ingredient, accounts for more than half the price of a gallon of gas.Though a gallon of gas is still 41 cents less than a year ago, analysts warn prices still have room to rise in the near-term and put a crimp in people’s budgets.“Consumers confronted by inflated prices for basic necessities will now have to spread their budgets even more thinly,” International Energy Agency (IEA) said in an oil outlook on Friday. “This augurs badly for the economic recovery and growth.”Gas price prediction: Gas prices are down but projected to rise again. How much will gas cost in 2023?Why are oil (and gas) prices rising?Oil prices initially got a boost earlier in April after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries surprisingly announced it would cut production starting in May by 1.66 million barrels per day.On Friday morning, oil rose further after IEA predicted global oil demand will climb by 2 million barrels a day this year to a record 101.9 million barrels per day, “buoyed by a resurgent China.” It estimates 90% of the growth in oil demand will come from China.In the U.S., refineries also are performing routine spring maintenance and transitioning to producing summer gas, which temporarily constricts supply and boosts prices. Summer gas produces less emissions and is more expensive to produce, whereas cheaper winter gas ignites more easily to start your car in cold temperaturesWarm weather usually draws out more drivers, too, boosting demand for gas.All these factors helped pushed America’s West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices to a four-month high around $83 per barrel on Friday.“When the cost of crude oil crosses the $80 a barrel mark, that puts a lot of upward pressure on what we pay at the pump,” said Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson.Story continuesGreen energy: Biden boosts clean energy in coal country despite facing pushback from Congress on climateRisky cheap gas move: Cheaper gas in the Midwest could actually be over a billion dollar risk for some statesGas prices are displayed at a Mobil gas station in Prospect Heights, Ill., Sunday, Jan. 29, 2023.How high will gas prices rise?No one expects average nationwide gas prices to challenge last June’s record $5.016 per gallon, but analysts generally expect prices to continue ticking higher over the next couple of months.“$4.50 (per gallon) might be something we could see later this spring or summer, but it comes with huge uncertainty,” said Nikolai Roussanov, Wharton finance professor. “The economy is slowing. If the economy slows enough to reduce demand, then we won’t see gas prices go as high. I think gas will probably be somewhere between here and $4.50.”Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, expects gas prices to start sliding again in June.“Expect the upward trend to continue through much of the rest of spring, but once the transition to summer gasoline and refinery maintenance are behind us, April and May jumps could bring June slumps,” he said.

We prioritize assessing our water footprint and conserving water, particularly in California, the location of our headquarters and a state perennially challenged by water scarcity.In our facilities, we make our greatest gains in water conservation by using reclaimed water instead of potable water for irrigation and our cooling plant systems, whenever possible. In fact, we decreased our freshwater dependency at our San Diego headquarters by 51 percent from 2016 to 2022 by expanding our recycled water system. These improvements help reduce our dependency on potable water and increase resiliency in our operations.At our manufacturing facilities, we conduct water audits to assess usage and share best practices between our locations. Additionally, we also have an internal price for water that makes the real cost of water usage and water treatment transparent and evident. This facilitates a strong motivation to develop cost-effective and water-efficient processes.At our Singapore manufacturing facility, we implemented numerous water savings projects in 2022, resulting in more than 200,000 cumulative cubic meters (m3 ) of annual water savings. For example, we conducted a utilization study to determine opportunities for system integration and enhancement, resulting in an improvement of our deionized (DI) water supply systems, which has increased the amount of reclaimed water by approximately 80,000 m3 per year. We also replaced our water plant electrodeionization (EDI) system with a continuous electrodeionization (CEDI) system, allowing for water to be recycled into raw water tanks, saving approximately 30,000 m3 per year.Learn more in Qualcomm's 2022 Corporate Responsibility ReportStory continuesQualcomm, Friday, April 14, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/749284/How-Qualcomm-Is-Assessing-and-Managing-Its-Water-Footprint]"

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.21% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.42%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.64%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the online travel company had lost 4.37% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 6.29% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.71% in that time.Expedia will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Expedia to post earnings of -$0.04 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 91.67%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.68 billion, up 19.28% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.26 per share and revenue of $12.78 billion. These totals would mark changes of +36.38% and +9.55%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Expedia should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Expedia currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Expedia is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 9.82. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 22.23, so we one might conclude that Expedia is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that EXPE currently has a PEG ratio of 0.7. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Commerce was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.16 at yesterday's closing price.The Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Eli Lilly’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+25.4% vs. +10.3%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others. Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes already launched and cancer drug Jaypirca already approved.Mounjaro is off to a solid start. However, the CRL for donanemab and mirikizumab will probably delay potential launch of the candidates by several months.Generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drug, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are a few top-line headwinds. Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of Q1 results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+3.0% vs. -11.1%). The company’s robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.During the fourth quarter, the company opened a new bioanalytical lab in Richmond, VA to support its clinical research business. The integration of PPD is largely complete and drove strong returns for the shareholders with outstanding execution and business performance throughout the year.However, revenues within Europe declined in the low teens. The same in Asia Pacific fell in the mid-single digits, while China registered a decline in the mid-single digits. Revenues in the rest of the world declined in high-single digits.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+7.0% vs. -0.1%). The company enjoys a consistent level of contract flows, and subsequent backlog growth bolsters its long-term revenue prospects.It remains the largest U.S. defense contractor that has a steady order inflow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The U.S. budgetary provisions boost LMT’s business. Lockheed expects to deliver 147 to 153 F-35 aircraft in 2023 and 2024.However, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results. An uncertainty revolving around the possible sanction by China on Lockheed might impact the latter.(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

However, lower F-35 production volume might have adversely impacted this business unit’s overall sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aeronautics unit’s first-quarter revenues stands at $6,196 million, indicating a 3.2% decline from the prior-year reported figure.The Space business segment’s first-quarter results are likely to be affected by the 2021 renationalization of the AWE program. However, continued ramp-up in the next-generation interceptor program is expected to have benefited the unit to some extent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Space business segment’s first-quarter revenues is $2,632 million, indicating a 2.9% decline from the prior-year reported figure.Impact of MFC &amp; RMS PerformanceLockheed Martin’s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) segment provides critical missile defense support to the United States and foreign allies.

The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Foreign Military Sales customers and non-U.S. Department of Defense participants.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed Martin enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. The company’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft using advanced technologies to meet current warfare needs boost demand significantly.This increased demand results in a solid contract flow from Pentagon and other U.S. allies for production and associated support to modernize and upgrade the F-35 jets. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Impressively, the F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for the Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 66% of the segment’s net sales in 2022. Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 345 jets in the backlog till December 2022.Looking ahead, the company expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This should bolster LMT’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft field.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such predictions indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to reap the benefits of the abovementioned market’s expansion.Other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT, which are also expected to gain from the global military aircraft market’s growth opportunities.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft.

DUK recently announced that its two solar projects in Florida have reached completion and are ready to serve its customers with 150 megawatts (MW) of clean energy. The electricity to be generated from these two facilities has the capability to power nearly 23,000 homes.As part of the community solar program portfolio, Clean Energy Connection, the two solar projects comprise approximately 216,000 and 220,000 single-axis tracking solar panels, respectively. Such a large-scale solar energy installation capacity takes DUK a step forward in its goal to achieve carbon neutrality in its operation by 2050 while serving customers with a reliable and more affordable energy mix.Duke Energy’s Growth Prospects in FloridaDuke Energy Florida boasts an investment of approximately $2 billion in solar generation capacity. With this investment strategy, the company aims to add 25 grid-tied solar power plants by 2024, with nearly five million solar panels. This will boast a generation capacity of 1,500 MW, which will be enough to provide reliable energy to its 1.9 million customers.Duke Energy’s Clean Energy Connection is a program that lets residential and business customers in Florida support renewable energy, subscribe to solar power and earn credits on their electricity bills. Such a program assists the company in growing its customer base in the Florida region.While Duke Energy Florida appears to have been increasingly focused on investing and boosting its renewable generation capacity in the Florida region through various strategies, Florida boasts immense scope for the company’s further expansion.Going forward, per the latest report from the Solar Energy Industries Association, Florida boasts a capacity addition of 10,868 MW in the next five years.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 5.86%.The healthcare bellwether’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in each of the trailing four quarters. It delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.94%, on average.J&amp;J’s stock has declined 7.6% in the past year against an increase of 6.1% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to ConsiderJ&amp;J’s Pharma segment is expected to have contributed to the top line led by increased penetration and market share gains of key products such as Darzalex and Stelara. Regarding Stelara, while J&amp;J expects Stelara volumes to increase till the loss of exclusivity in late 2023, the growth might have been hurt by pricing pressure as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe.Our model estimates Darzalex and Stelara sales of $2.14 billion and $2.42 billion, respectively.Other core products like Invega Sustenna and new drugs, Erleada and Tremfya, might have also contributed significantly to sales growth.However, lower sales of its key medicine, Imbruvica is likely to have hurt the top line in the first quarter. Rising competitive pressure in the United States from novel oral agents is likely to have hurt sales of the key drug, Imbruvica. Also, below pre-COVID levels in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia market are expected to have hurt sales in the United States. Our model estimates Imbruvica sales to be $870.6 million.Generic/biosimilar competition for drugs like Zytiga and Remicade is likely to have hurt the top line.Our model estimates J&amp;J’s Pharmaceuticals unit revenues to be $12.62 billion.Overall, Pharmaceuticals unit sales had slowed down in the fourth quarter though it was an above-market performance. It remains to be seen if the sales trend improved in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesWith regard to the MedTech segment, sales are expected to have been driven by continued recovery in surgical procedures, better commercial execution and new product launches. However, lingering headwinds from hospital staffing and the effects of the COVID resurgence in China along with volume-based procurement issues in the country are expected to have hurt international sales. Our model estimates J&amp;J’s MedTech segment revenues to be $7.32 billion.In the Consumer Healthcare segment, while continued growth in markets and strategic price increases are expected to benefit results in the first quarter, some challenges like inflationary pressure within the supply chain and higher input costs are expected to continue to hurt profits.Our model estimates J&amp;J’s Consumer Health segment revenues to be $3.64 billion.Overall, currency headwinds are expected to have a negative impact on J&amp;J’s top line in the first quarter.J&amp;J expects supply constraints, inflationary pressure and rising input costs to continue to hurt margins in the first quarter of 2023Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for J&amp;J this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Kyiv expected to receive more support during an upcoming conference in London, he added.""The international partners have reassured us of their long-term support,"" Shmyhal said, describing his meetings in Washington, and referring to total financing of $115 billion over the next four years that was leveraged by the IMF's approval last month of a $15.6 billion loan.Ukraine needs about $14 billion in funding this year to close a budget gap, Shmyhal said, noting that the United States would provide $2.3 billion to plug the hole, while the European Union would provide 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion).In addition to Switzerland and Denmark, he said Spain, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Iceland and the Netherlands also promised more aid.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who paid a surprise visit to Kyiv in February and met with Shmyhal again on Thursday, repeatedly urged finance ministers and central banks to maintain support for Ukraine, the Treasury Department said.Yellen on Thursday said she told Shmyhal the United States had provided significant economic support to Ukraine since the start of the war in February 2022, and would deliver more in coming months, on top of security and humanitarian aid.Story continues'ON LIFE SUPPORT'Shmyhal said Ukrainian officials met with a number of U.S. cabinet secretaries in addition to Yellen, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, with a big focus on laying the groundwork for Ukraine's recovery and attracting foreign investment.He said the discussions also touched on Ukraine's insistence that the United States and other allies confiscate Russian assets to help cover the cost of rebuilding Ukraine - a sum put at $411 billion by the World Bank in a recent estimate.He urged the Group of Seven advanced economies to reaffirm their support for Ukraine and discuss the confiscation issue during an upcoming leaders summit in Japan, which is leading the G7 this year.The Netherlands and Switzerland also pledged support for the International Finance Corp's $2 billion Economic Resilience Action program that is designed to ramp up support for Ukraine’s private sector and boost economic resilience amid the war.The IFC program aims to leverage these donor funds using private sector investments, which will be needed to help cover the staggering cost of Ukraine's recovery.""A strong private sector is essential to help Ukraine's economy recover and support reconstruction efforts,"" said Makhtar Diop, the IFC's managing director. ""Ukraine's economy remains on life support, and we will continue working with other development partners to provide the guarantees and grants the private sector needs.""The World Bank also announced $200 million in grant financing for a project to Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, with some $300 million in additional funding envisaged to come from partners through grants and other contributions.($1 = 0.9094 euros) (Reporting by Andrea Shalal and Katharine Jackson; editing by Susan Heavey, Diane Craft and Paul Simao)]"

The testing marks the final series of important trials for the new nuclear unit, a crucial step toward operations and providing consumers with a reliable, carbon-free energy source for the next 60-80 years.What is Hot Functional Testing?This test is a critical step in the commissioning process of a new nuclear power plant. It is conducted to verify the successful operation of reactor components and systems together, and confirm that the reactor is ready for fuel load. As part of the testing process, the site team will start running Unit 4 plant system without any nuclear fuel in the reactor. They will then advance through the procedure until the system reaches normal operating pressure and temperature.As part of the same process, nuclear operators will use the heat generated by the unit's four reactor coolant pumps to raise the system’s temperature and pressure to normal operating levels. Once normal operating temperature and pressure levels are achieved and maintained, the unit's primary turbine will be increased to normal operating speed using steam from the plant. During the entire testing process, nuclear operators will be able to exercise and validate procedures as necessary prior to fuel load.Projected Service DateAccording to Georgia Power, Vogtle Unit 4 is anticipated to begin operation in the last quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024. The new Vogtle unit is a crucial part of Georgia Power's commitment to providing its 2.7 million customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy. Once the unit starts functioning, it is expected to power more than 500,000 homes and businesses with clean energy sources.Co-owners and OperatorsThe aforesaid unit will be run by Southern Nuclear, a subsidiary of The Southern Company, on behalf of the co-owners — Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities. The Vogtle Unit 4 Electric Generating project is a collaboration between Georgia Power and a diverse group of other utilities, ensuring supply of safe and reliable energy to meet growing customer demand.Story continuesBenefits of Vogtle Expansion ProjectThe abovementioned project, which has been under construction since 2013, is a massive infrastructural development with several potential benefits for the state of Georgia and the nation. It is expected to create thousands of jobs for local workers, promote economic growth, and provide clean and safe energy.The new nuclear unit will produce zero greenhouse gas emissions, which will make it an integral part of the effort to combat climate change. The project will also be beneficial in advancing nuclear power technology and engineering in the United States. This advancement, in turn, will contribute to make nuclear power a more viable and sustainable source of energy in the future.Georgia Power's Commitment to Clean EnergyGeorgia Power is focused on providing clean and safe energy to its customers, and the Vogtle expansion project is a testament to that.

152,7ddb210b-98d5-3c68-b356-9c950d70631d,NKE,2023-04-15,3 Retail Stocks to Buy on Sale Before They Hit All-Time Highs,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-retail-stocks-buy-sale-011432220.html,1681262072,STORY,"['HD', 'NKE', 'TGT']","[Retail stocks have been coming back to life lately, but they are far from outperforming the indices. While that may have more active investors looking away from consumer-based stocks, value-oriented investors may be looking at retail stocks to buy.There is one problem though, and that’s a potential recession. For several quarters now, investors have been worried about a looming economic slowdown. So far though, we’re not seeing any drastic declines in economic output and companies continue to generate solid results.Granted, we are in a tightening cycle and many concerns still linger. But inflation continues to run higher than normal and the labor market remains strong. That’s keeping consumer spending alive (and mostly well).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite this, most retail stocks continue to struggle. I want to look at three names that are still down more than 30% from the highs, but that I believe will go back to make new all-time highs.With that, let’s look at three retail stocks to buy.Home Depot (HD)earnings reports hdSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comLike stocks, real estate is an asset class that continues to perform well over the long term. Therefore, there’s a vested interest in keeping momentum alive in the home improvement category. Note how the rapid rise in interest rates has yet to really trigger large declines in the housing market. That may come in time should we see a recession, but for now, it’s holding up pretty well.In that vein, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) should continue to perform well over the long term too.After enjoying a strong boom during the Covid-19 years, Home Depot stock has fallen on tough times. Shares have almost doubled off the 2020 low, but are still down about 29.2% from the all-time high. It doesn’t help that analysts expect roughly flat revenue growth this year and a 5% dip in earnings.To me though, what does it matter if it takes a year or two for Home Depot stock to find its footing? It wouldn’t be too surprising if that were the case, given the run-up off the low (although I think it’s a conservative view). At the end of the day, consumers are going to continue making home improvements and in my view, that will eventually drive Home Depot stock higher.Story continuesNike (NKE)A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes. retail stocks to buySource: mimohe / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) is a top-level consumer company, which dominates with high-level athletes and performers donning the “Swoosh.” Other retailer stocks that I’m fond of, such as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), show promise for the long-term, but are approaching an all-time high. Nike still has a ways to go.Nike uses a combination of wholesale, retail and direct-to-consumer (or DTC) via online channels to drive its business. As long as consumers own houses, they’ll go to Home Depot and as long as they play sports, they’ll wear Nike.Like Home Depot though, Nike’s bottom line is under pressure. Analysts expect a 14% decline in earnings this year despite a near-10% gain in revenue. Next year, the top and bottom line are forecast to improve, growing 7% and 25%, respectively.Here’s the thing, though. Nike is in its last quarter of the fiscal year. Meaning that 14% earnings dip for the year is coming to an end, setting the stage for a strong fiscal year rebound in the coming quarters.Target (TGT)an image of bullseye the target dog in a target store. retail stocks to buySource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comLast but not least, we have Target (NYSE:TGT). Shares fell 46.7% from the August 2021 high to the June 2022 low. Despite a mild rally and a decent couple of trading days lately, the stock still remains 35% below the all-time high.While retail may not be experiencing the best environment right now, Target is one of the premiere names in the space. Like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and others, Target retail stock shows promise as it has built out a strong omni-channel presence, allowing it to leverage a digital and physical footprint while benefiting from the logistics that were already in place.Not to mention, the company has raised its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years. Despite periods of high inflation and deep recessions, this company’s dividend continues to chug along. Now yielding about 2.6%, it’s worth paying attention, particularly as this name should eventually return to all-time highs, making it one of the top retail stocks to buy.It won’t, but just for argument’s sake, say Target stock hit new highs before its next dividend increase (likely in June). It would yield just 1.6%.Interestingly, estimates call for robust earnings growth and strong revenue growth in 2024. If that comes to fruition, bulls should be pleased.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

What banking crisis?That was the message delivered by some of the largest US lenders on Friday as they discussed their performance during one of the most challenging periods for the banking industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and PNC (PNC) all reported surging revenue and profits in the first quarter even as regulators seized some regional lenders and panic spread across the financial system in March. Their top executives offered multiple assurances that the worst was over.“We've had a rough spell in March but things were looking better now,"" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told reporters. His boss, CEO Jamie Dimon, said “you've already seen things calm down quite a bit.” Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser added: “Our banking system as a whole is very strong.”Dimon was, as ever, the most emboldened among bank executives who met with Wall Street analysts on Friday, at one point chafing at a question about a ""credit crunch"" facing the system following the collapse of three US banks last month.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon testifies at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2022. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)""I wouldn't use the word credit crunch, if I were you,"" Dimon said. ""Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening. And most of that will be around certain real estate things.""Some analysts who follow the industry agreed. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo wrote in a note Friday that “there is no evidence of a banking crisis except that it seems that JPM has been a port in the storm.” UBS titled its note about the bank results this way: “What crisis? The banking industry flexes back.”Lending rose among all banks in the week ending April 5, according to new Fed data released Friday. And so did deposits, by $61.5 billion.Challenges aheadEven if this is no longer a crisis, it was still clear from the results that the industry faces a number of challenges that will continue to test even the biggest and most resilient banks while pressuring some of their smaller, weaker rivals.Story continuesChief among them is the effect that higher interest rates have on deposits and loans, or more specifically a key measure of profitability known as net interest income. It is the difference between what a bank earns on its loans and pays out on its deposits.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The rise in interest rates over the past year boosted this measure of income for some of these large banks, including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, because it allowed them to charge more for their loans. JPMorgan's net interest income was up 48% compared to the year-ago quarter, and it raised its net interest income expectation for all of 2023 to $81 billion.But the concern now is that those margins could begin to fall across the industry as institutions that don’t have the heft of JPMorgan begin to pay more aggressively for deposits, hoping that higher rates will keep their funding intact.At PNC and Wells Fargo, net interest income actually fell when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022; PNC said it expects this income to be down 2-4% in the second quarter. Dimon admitted in a call with reporters that JPMorgan’s net interest income ""will come down significantly next year and I think that's a more important statement than what it is for this year.""Wells Fargo and PNC stock ended Friday roughly flat, compared with a 7.5% rise at JPMorgan and a 4.8% rise at Citigroup.Thinning marginsThose pressures are even more acute for small banks that depend on loans for much of their profits and can’t turn to investment banking or trading for additional revenue.When one small Southern institution, Bank of South Carolina (BKSC), announced its earnings last Tuesday its president warned in a release that the bank was behind in its profit plan for the first three months of the year because of “precipitous increases in our deposit costs to meet the intense competition.” Loan interest income was up but “our margins remain thin.”Stocks of some regional lenders dropped Friday, especially those that received more investor scrutiny following the failures last month of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Truist (TFC), one of the biggest regionals in the US, was down 1.7%. Smaller regionals PacWest (PACW) and Western Alliance (WAL) were down 1.7% and 1.5% while First Republic (FRC) and Zions (ZION) lost more than 3%.The results from the biggest banks offered other warnings about possible trouble to come. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, for example, are both preparing for the possibility that credit conditions could worsen.JPMorgan increased its provision for credit losses by 56% compared to a year ago, a sign that it expects more debt to go bad as the economy slows. Wells Fargo put aside $1.2 billion for credit losses, including a $643 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate loans, as well as an increase for credit card and auto loans. Some analysts expect commercial real estate to be a problem for some banks as developers struggle to pay their debts.“While most consumers remain resilient, we’ve seen some consumer financial health trends gradually weakening from a year ago, and we’ve continued to take credit tightening actions to position the portfolio for a slowing economy,” Wells Fargo CFO Michael Santomassimo said on an earnings call.Fraser, Citigroup’s CEO, said the bank expected recent industry turmoil to cause “credit to contract,” meaning it’s “more likely that the US will enter into a shallow recession” late in the year.Such a recession “could be exacerbated in depth and duration in a more severe credit crunch.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Good point on mixed economic data: ""The problem for many investors right now is that it’s still possible to construct fairly divergent narratives about the economy depending on which series you look at,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.""On the one hand, an array of leading indicators are pointing to a U.S. recession over the coming year, in line with our own house view at Deutsche Bank Research,"" Reid added. ""But if you wanted to take the opposite view, you could point to unemployment around its lowest in decades, a high level of vacancies by historic standards, financial markets that have mostly shrugged off the SVB-related turmoil by now, along with growing signs that inflation is softening and the Fed are nearing a pause in their rate hikes.""3. More earnings on the way: “We're bullish on Netflix into 1Q23 results as we think management will be optimistic on the lift to the P&amp;L [profit and loss] from paid sharing implementation,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall.4. Shiny gains: Gold prices (GC=F) are a stone's throw away from the summer 2020 record highs of $2,075 an ounce. Gold prices are up 13% year to date as investors seek out safe-haven investments post-banking-industry turmoil.5. Building declines: Mortgage rates have declined for five straight weeks.

157,49c1b045-4d99-3221-a5b1-a478c2504ddc,WFC,2023-04-15,Analyzing Q1 Bank Earnings: Good or Bad?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyzing-q1-bank-earnings-good-221610442.html,1681510570,STORY,"['BAC', '^GSPC', 'WFC', 'JPM', 'C']","[The market liked what it saw in the quarterly releases from JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C, and even Wells Fargo WFC. There was plenty to like in these results, with higher interest rates helping these big players expand their margins while demand for loans remained strong, helping loan portfolios grow.The bank worries that took center stage in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank fiasco didn’t pertain to these big players. JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo, which reported Friday morning, and Bank of America, which is scheduled to report Tuesday morning (April 18th), regularly go through the Fed’s stress tests and are perceived as very safe.The diminished confidence in the banking space is specifically centered on the small and mid-sized regional banks that will start reporting results this week. The flight to safety among depositors has forced these banks to offer much higher deposit rates to stem the tide. This will show up in net-interest margin pressures relative not only to what came through from the likes of JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo Friday morning but also relative to what these same banks had reported in the preceding period.Returning to the group’s Q1 results, the fact that the investment banking business was weak during the period was no surprise for the market. We knew that advisory fees would, at best, be about two-thirds of what they were in the year-earlier period, as tighter monetary policy and other macroeconomic headwinds have been weighing on deal-making.JPMorgan’s net interest income jumped +49%, as average loans increased +5% and net-interest margin expanded to 2.63% from 1.67% in the year-earlier period. Margins expanded for Citigroup and Wells Fargo as well, as funding costs (the rates offered to depositors) didn’t go up by that much. The market liked JPMorgan’s raised guidance for net interest income this year, though management has stated that 2023 will mark the high watermark on this count over the next few years.Story continuesLending remained strong in Q1 but started to soften towards the end of the quarter in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank failure, a trend that has carried into the current period and will likely remain a negative factor over the coming quarters as well.Many in the market see the resulting tightening in financial conditions as reflected in the aforementioned diminished lending outlook becoming a significant growth headwind for the U.S. economy, which was already under severe strain due to the Fed’s extraordinary monetary policy tightening.Partly driving the market’s favorable reaction to these big bank results is a sigh of relief in a way, which follows an almost indiscriminate sell-off for the group since early March when the Silicon Valley Bank issue took center stage. The JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo results were undoubtedly good, but sentiment on the group had weakened so much that market participants found the results reassuring. Bank stocks had been leading the market this year through early March but have struggled since March 6th, as the chart below shows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe issue with the bank stocks isn’t so much their current earnings power but rather how their profitability will shape up in the coming economic slowdown. Bank investors are wary of the group’s track record of making a lot of money during the good times, which the group then gives back during the bad times.The question is how ‘bad’ will the coming ‘bad times’ be for the economy and what will that do to bank earnings.Regarding the Finance sector scorecard for Q1, we now have results from 18.5% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are up +25.3% from the same period last year on +17.3% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 100% beating revenue estimates.Looking at the Finance sector as a whole, total Q1 earnings for the sector are expected to be up +4.2% on +7.7% higher revenues.For the Zacks Major Banks industry, which includes all of the aforementioned banks and accounts for roughly 40% of total Finance sector earnings, total Q1 earnings are on track to be up +16.4% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues.The table below shows the sector’s Q1 earnings and revenue expectations at the ‘medium’ industry level in the context of what the space reported in the preceding period and what is expected in the following quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs noted earlier, skeptics of the banking industry argue that the group ends up giving away all the profits that it had accumulated during the good times when the macro environment turns south. The Covid downturn was an anomaly in that respect, but there is some truth to the allegation.We will see how the economic picture unfolds in the coming quarters, but the credit quality metrics in the reported Q1 results do not point toward any imminent deterioration.The earnings growth picture for the Finance sector is expected to improve in 2023 as we turn the page on tough comparisons, even though the economic growth pace is expected to moderate under the cumulative weight of the Fed’s tightening. Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +11.3% in 2023 on -1.9% lower revenues, which would follow the -15.9% earnings decline on +7.7% higher revenues in 2022.2023 Q1 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding Friday morning’s bank results, we now have Q1 earnings from 30 S&amp;P 500 members. Total earnings for these 30 index members are up +7% from the same period last year on +10% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 73.3% beating revenue estimates.Banks and other financial operators dominate this week’s reporting docket, but we also have a slew of blue-chip operators from Johnson &amp; Johnson and Proctor &amp; Gamble to Netflix, Tesla, and many others.The first set of charts compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for the 30 index members that have reported with what we had seen from the group in other recent quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Earnings Big Picture To get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q1 and the following three quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, 2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -9.4% on +1.9% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.Embedded in these 2023 Q1 earnings and revenue growth projections is the expectation of continued margin pressures, which has been a recurring theme in recent quarters. The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimates for Q1 came down as the quarter got underway, in-line with the trend that had been in place since the start of 2022. That said, the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates was smaller relative to what we had seen in the preceding two periods.Estimates for full-year 2023 have also been coming down as well, as we have been pointing out consistently in these pages. The chart below shows how the aggregate 2023 S&amp;P 500 earnings estimate has evolved.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we have been pointing out all along, 2023 earnings estimates peaked in April 2022 and have been coming down ever since. Since the mid-April peak, aggregate earnings have declined by -13.1% for the index as a whole and -14.8% for the index on an ex-Energy basis, with the declines far bigger in a number of major sectors.You have likely read about the roughly -20% cuts to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates, on average, ahead of recessions.Many in the market interpret this to mean that estimates still have plenty to fall in the days ahead. But as the aforementioned magnitude of negative revisions in excess of -14% on an ex-Energy basis show, we have already traveled a fair distance in that direction. Importantly, some key sectors in the path of the Fed’s tightening cycle, like Construction, Retail, Discretionary, and even Technology, have already gotten their 2023 estimates shaved off by a fifth since mid-April.We are not saying that estimates don’t need to fall any further. If nothing else, estimates for the Finance sector will need to come down in the wake of the ongoing banking industry issues. But rather that the bulk of the cuts are likely behind us, particularly if the coming economic downturn is a lot less problematic than many seem to assume or fear.Please note that the $1.893 trillion aggregate earnings estimate for the index in 2023 approximates to an index ‘EPS’ of $213.38, down from $221.05 in 2022. The chart below shows how this 2023 index ‘EPS’ estimate has evolved over time.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2023 Q1 Earnings Season Likely to Reflect Continued Margin Pressures  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

All three companies reported strong profits, as rising rates boosted interest income. Ken Leon, CFRA Research Director of Equity Research joined Yahoo Finance to share his biggest takeaway from the banks' quarterly results.“It's really a sigh of relief that our largest banks are durable. They were able to outperform,"" Leon said.He also pointed to strong consumer and commercial loan activity as a boon for investors, saying it is an opportunity for ""investors to have higher confidence on the return of capital, whether it be dividends or share buybacks.""Watch the full interview with Dave Briggs and Rachelle Akuffo here.Key video moments:00:00:03 On biggest takeaway from earnings00:00:19 On investor confidence00:01:20 On the impact of regional bank failures on the big banks00:01:40 On Wells Fargo's commercial real estate businessVideo TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: What was your biggest takeaway from today's earnings?KEN LEON: Well, compared to the middle of March, it's really a sigh of relief that our largest banks are durable. They were able to outperform. And also, looking ahead, we're still seeing a healthy consumer. And there's a lot of commercial loan activity. So, overall, for the banks, particularly the largest banks, it looks like an opportunity to gain wallet share and for investors to have higher confidence on return of capital, whether it be dividends or for share buybacks.DAVE BRIGGS: It's good to see you, Ken. So on the JPMorgan Chase earnings call this morning, Jamie Dimon was asked about the impact of Silicon Valley Bank collapsing. Let's listen.JAMIE DIMON: Yeah, I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening. And most of that will be around certain real estate things. You've heard it from real estate investors already. So I just look at that as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the fast conditions a little bit tighter, increases the odds of a recession. That's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch.DAVE BRIGGS: So it's not a credit crunch. How would you describe the impact of the SVB collapse as we move forward?KEN LEON: It's opportunity and risks. For the largest banks, it's an opportunity to gain share. Where there's risk is for the smaller regionals or community banks that really depend on commercial loans, particularly commercial real estate. This is not a significant percentage of loans for a JPMorgan or a Citi. Wells Fargo actually gave quite a bit of detail out of their total loan book of 933 billion. Commercial real estate's about 33 billion, and office buildings, which is really where there could be distress, looking out one to three years, is under 15 billion. So I think it's framed right, and Jamie Dimon's comments are correct, mostly because they're sitting there as a global bank.]"

Stocks forfeited gains following these headlines and steady selling in the major indexes pushed stocks to session lows in early afternoon trade before an afternoon rebound.""These expectations have been seesawing for four consecutive months, alternating between increases and decreases,"" said Joanne Hsu, director for the survey of consumers. ""Uncertainty over short-run inflation expectations continues to be notably elevated, indicating that the recent volatility in expected year-ahead inflation is likely to continue.""Overall, the report showed sentiment was ""essentially unchanged"" in April, as the index stood at 63.5, up from 62 at the end of March.

Compared to the same period last year, however, deposits fell 7%.In the company's earnings release, CEO Jamie Dimon said, ""the U.S. economy continues to be on generally healthy footings—consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon, and the banking industry turmoil adds to these risks.""Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, arrives for the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing titled Annual Oversight of the Nations Largest Banks, in Hart Building on Thursday, September 22, 2022.

Murdoch is already facing embarrassment after his fifth engagement collapsed after just two weeks, while an explosive Vanity Fair article last week revealed salacious details about his relationship with Jerry Hall and the state of the 92-year-old’s health.“So far, nothing has really gone Rupert’s way,” says Alice Enders at Enders Analysis.“All this is embarrassing. It’s all bad for Rupert’s legacy.”Fox’s legal woes date back to the aftermath of the 2020 US presidential election, when the opinionated news channel was battling to keep hold of viewers loyal to Donald Trump.Trump was pushing the false idea that Joe Biden had won thanks to fraudulent votes.Internal messages from senior Fox executives, made public as part of the trial, show they were fretting Trump supporters would switch to rival right wing networks if the channel did not back the MAGA leader.Story continuesTwo technology companies, Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA, have accused Fox of knowingly airing false claims that their systems were used to rig votes and steal the election.Murdoch admitted in a deposition that some Fox presenters had endorsed the idea of a stolen election on air.Asked if he could have intervened to prevent the false claims from being broadcast, the media baron said: “I could have. But I didn’t.”This apparent awareness is at the heart of the legal challenge launched by Dominion, which argues that Fox knew the claims were false but broadcast them anyway.In a raft of explosive emails and text messages, Murdoch, senior executives and presenters voiced their concerns that the channel was airing false claims peddled by Trump and his team.Murdoch described claims the election was stolen as “really crazy” and “damaging”, adding it was “very hard to credibly claim foul everywhere”.Meanwhile, controversial host Tucker Carlson branded the idea that Dominion had rigged votes “shockingly reckless” and described the former President as a “demonic force”.Raj Shah, a top Fox executive, said the claims were “outlandish” and “mind-blowingly nuts”. One producer on Laura Ingraham’s show wrote: “This dominion s— is going to give me a f—--- aneurysm.”Fox News Murdoch Dominion - Fox BusinessSmartmatic is seeking $2.7bn in damages, while Dominion wants $1.6bn. The trial is due to begin with opening statements on Monday and run for five weeks.To win, the two companies must prove that Fox either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy.In a blow to Fox’s case, the channel has been barred from using the defence that it was merely reporting “newsworthy” claims.In a further setback, the judge has threatened sanctions against the channel over accusations its lawyers withheld critical details about the role Murdoch played at Fox News.Superior court judge Eric Davis said the company’s handling of the case left it with a “credibility problem”.“From what I have seen, Fox could be in some serious trouble,” says one industry source, adding that the broadcaster could be liable to “punitive damages”.Successful claims by Dominion and Smartmatic could open the floodgates to more lawsuits.Ms Enders says Fox’s huge profits mean it can absorb the financial blow. But she adds: “I think the fact that litigation is going to go on and on makes it very difficult to value Fox because it’s got these potential liabilities.”More fundamentally, industry watchers warn the trial could have a damaging impact on Murdoch’s reputation and legacy – just as he looks to hand over the reins.A shareholder suit filed directly against Murdoch and his son Lachlan alleges that their failure to act on “red flags” exposed the company to the defamation suits in the first place, highlighting the risk of personal liability for the family.Lachlan is also expected to take the stand.“The cash by itself is not so much an issue, but it may raise questions about the management decision-making and compliance,” the industry source says.Murdoch has already suffered a shareholder backlash this year, after his attempt to merge Fox and News Corp, the parent company of titles including the Wall Street Journal, Sun and Times, was blocked.The deal was seen as a way of consolidating power as the billionaire gears up for a handover.Many also question Murdoch’s decision not to settle the Dominion case – a strategy previously employed during the phone-hacking scandal.News Corp is still forking out hundreds of millions of pounds to settle those claims, but damaging headlines about the scandal are long gone.Fighting the Dominion and Smartmatic cases in court has already aired Fox’s dirty laundry and threatens to turn up yet more embarrassing details once the trial begins.“It is riveting that Fox lawyers have failed to stop the trial,” says Enders. “I would have thought that someone should have told Rupert many months ago to settle this, even though it may appear to be some form of admission.”As Murdoch prepares to take the stand, the media mogul knows it is not only his finances on the line but his reputation.]"

The trial promises to shed further light on the inner workings of one of the biggest U.S. cable networks, known for its conservative commentators.Dominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News in 2021, accusing them of ruining its reputation by airing false claims by Republican former President Donald Trump and his lawyers that the Denver-based company's voting machines were used to rig the outcome of the election against him and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.Dominion is seeking to prove that Fox personnel - show producers and hosts all the way up to the top executives - knew that the election claims were false but continued hosting guests who touted them, fearing the loss of viewers to competing right-wing media outlets that embraced the conspiracy theories. Dominion cited troves of internal Fox communications that it said proved the network knowingly spread falsehoods or recklessly disregarded the truth - the legal standard of ""actual malice"" that it must meet to prevail in a defamation case.Fox has argued that Dominion cherry-picked evidence to mischaracterize the network's coverage decisions, which it said were reasonable because election-rigging claims by the president's lawyers were inherently newsworthy. Fox has said it also gave Dominion's side of the story by airing its denials.WILL RUPERT MURDOCH TESTIFY?Yes. The Fox Corp chairman is set to take the witness stand, along with other executives including Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott. The trial is also due to include testimony from a parade of conservative-leaning Fox hosts including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro. The trial is expected to last five to six weeks.Story continuesCOULD THE TWO SIDES STILL SETTLE?Possibly, but experts think that is unlikely because the two sides have litigated the case fiercely for two years and framed it as more than a simple business dispute that could likely be resolved by a settlement.Dominion has argued that Fox's conduct was damaging to American democracy and that the network must be held accountable for crossing the line between journalism and the heedless pursuit of ratings. Fox has called Dominion's lawsuit an assault on the free press and framed its stance in the case as a defense of journalism and diversity of ideas in the public square.WHAT ABOUT DAMAGES?Fox has attacked the credibility of Dominion's damages estimate, saying it is based upon unrealistic growth projections and faulty assumptions. The network has said Dominion was worth only $80 million in 2018 and has continued to grow and post strong revenues despite the untrue claims of election-rigging.Dominion has defended its damages model, which it has said was based on industry standard accounting methods. An expert report commissioned by the company attributed scores of lost contracts to Fox's coverage, though much of the report remains under seal. More of those details are likely to come out when Dominion's expert testifies.(Reporting by Jack Queen; Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder)]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +1.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 11.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.68 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Paypal, the consensus sales estimate of $6.97 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.5%. The $29.2 billion and $31.81 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.1% and +8.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.24%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:8.1% = US$1.8b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.Does International Business Machines Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, International Business Machines has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the IT industry classification.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. You can see the 5 risks we have identified for International Business Machines by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesInternational Business Machines' Debt And Its 8.1% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by International Business Machines, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.30. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

In the last reported quarter, the New York-based integrated systems provider missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The company is expected to have recorded higher aggregate revenues year over year despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and softness in traditional businesses.Factors at PlayDuring the first quarter, IBM expanded its Client Innovation Center by launching its second Japan Innovation Hub in Cebu City, Philippines. The new hub will be manned by a Filipino workforce with specialized skillsets in data analytics, AI, hybrid cloud transformation, application management, supply chain, finance and procurement. Leveraging AI, ML and automation techniques, it combines human expertise and advanced technologies for faster response, efficiency and transparency through a holistic approach to secure hybrid cloud environments. These are likely to have driven the top-line growth in the Software segment.During the quarter, IBM was selected as a technology partner by Telecom Egypt (TE) to modernize and transform network operations in the Middle Eastern country. With the aid of IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps, TE will have a comprehensive overview of its IT ecosystem, enabling greater management and control of the nationwide IT operations. IBM Robotic Process Automation will also help automate the tracking of service quality and network capacity. These automation solutions will greatly increase operational effectiveness, guarantee fast and superior service to end consumers and accelerate the nation's digital growth. These are likely to have generated incremental revenues in the Consulting segment.During the to-be-reported quarter, IBM also launched Quantum Computational Center in collaboration with Fundación Ikerbasque in the Basque Country of Spain. This is the second such facility established in Europe. The collaboration aims to enhance international research and industrial cooperation and construct a world-class quantum-trained community pool with comprehensive learning programs. Such state-of-the-art products are likely to have translated into higher revenues in the Infrastructure segment.However, escalating expenses toward cloud platform development amid intense competition in the cloud space are likely to have eroded its margins. In addition, the company is expected to have recorded adverse currency translation effects, likely impacting its bottom line.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $14,286 million. It generated revenues of $14,197 million in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.27 per share, indicating a decline from $1.40 in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for IBM this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%, with both pegged at $1.27.

173,02f1d43d-383b-3fc9-953f-5f619ffbbdcb,MPC,2023-04-15,Chevron (CVX) Nears Offshore Oil Contract With Angola & DRC,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-cvx-nears-offshore-oil-151403573.html,1681485243,STORY,"['CVX', 'RNGR', 'MPC', 'PARR']","[Chevron Corporation CVX recently finalized a production-sharing agreement with Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo to operate their shared offshore oil block. The deal could significantly impact the oil and gas industry in the central Africa region.This agreement comes after nearly 15 years of negotiation between the two countries that have been embroiled in a longstanding dispute over some offshore oil blocks controlled by Angola but claimed by Congo as its own.According to oil minister Didier Budimbu Ntubuanga, Sonangol, Angola's state-owned oil company, will write off a $200 million debt owed to it by Congolese state oil company, Sonahydroc. He also added that oil production from the block may begin as early as two years after a contract is signed.The production-sharing agreement is seen as a significant step toward resolving the dispute between the two nations. It also marks a milestone for Chevron. The company will be able to expand its operations in the central Africa region and tap into the vast oil and gas reserves in the offshore block. However, the potential rewards come with significant risks, as the region is known for its political instability and security concerns.While Angola is the second-largest producer of oil in Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo is the fifth largest. The two countries have been involved in a territorial dispute over the offshore oil blocks for years, which hindered their ability to tap into the region’s vast oil and gas reserves.In conclusion, Chevron's production-sharing agreement with Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo is a significant step toward developing Africa’s oil and gas industry. The contract is expected to unlock the offshore blocks’ potential and significantly boost the countries’ economies. However, CVX will have to navigate the region's complex political and security landscape to ensure success.Zacks Rank and Key PicksChevron, a leading integrated energy company with operations worldwide, generates approximately $95 billion in annual revenues and produces more than 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.Story continuesCurrently, CVX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

PVH and EnerSys ENS.Buy These 5 Low Price-to-Book-Value Stocks in AprilValue investors prefer price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. However, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for the purpose. The ratio is used to compare a stock's market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareThe P/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. Ideally, a P/B value under 1.0 is considered good, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank, General Motors, Unum Group, PVH Corp. and EnerSys are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What's Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

However, the fight to bring down inflation to the Fed’s target level is still a far cry.This is likely to result in more interest hikes in the coming months, which was also hinted at by the Fed earlier this year. Consumers are spending cautiously, but it’s quite difficult to cut down spending on essentials, especially groceries. Hence, despite retail sales slowing due to sky-high commodity prices, grocery sales have been on the rise.Given this situation, stocks like Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW, General Mills, Inc. GIS, Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG and McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC are likely to benefit in the near term.Grocery Sales on the RiseRetail sales have been rising at a slower pace as people are cautiously spending on essentials. According to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse, retail sales grew 4.7% year over year in March in the United States. March’s growth was slower than the prior month when retail sales grew 6.9% year over year.However, grocery sales have been rising steadily, driving overall retail sales. Although major segments recorded a decline, grocery sales rose 5.6% year over year in March.Separately, the Brick Meets Click/Mercatus Grocery Shopping Survey showed online grocery sales recorded sales of $8 billion in March. Given that there is no room to cut down on spending on essentials like food products, groceries continue to be the bright spot in the retail sector.Groceries fall under the consumer staples sector, which is fundamentally sound and mature, given that demand is mostly resilient to changes in the economic cycle. Companies in this category are defensive since they primarily sell essentials.The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) has gained 10% over the last six months.Story continuesMoreover, the jump in grocery sales comes as the latest data from the Labor Department, released on Apr 13, showed that wholesale prices declined sharply in March.The Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 0.5% in March after remaining unchanged in the first two months of the year. Wholesale prices were up 2.7% in March from a year ago, which is also significantly less than the 4.7% increase recorded in February.This is another sign that costs may finally be falling, which is good news for the grocery market.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be wise to invest in these four food and grocery stocks. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer, marketer and distributor of value-added frozen potato products, particularly French fries, and provides a range of appetizers.

178,a50aaeee-3919-4af0-a3e1-7ef825b10da1,PNC,2023-04-15,"Bank earnings impress investors, leave analysts asking — 'What crisis?'",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-earnings-impress-investors-leave-analysts-asking--what-crisis-120039228.html,1681560039,STORY,"['C', 'PNC', 'WFC', 'JPM']","[Banking crisis? What banking crisis?That was the message delivered by some of the largest US lenders on Friday as they discussed their performance during one of the most challenging periods for the banking industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and PNC (PNC) all reported surging revenue and profits in the first quarter even as regulators seized some regional lenders and panic spread across the financial system in March. Their top executives offered multiple assurances that the worst was over.“We've had a rough spell in March but things were looking better now,"" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told reporters. His boss, CEO Jamie Dimon, said “you've already seen things calm down quite a bit.” Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser added: “Our banking system as a whole is very strong.”Dimon was, as ever, the most emboldened among bank executives who met with Wall Street analysts on Friday, at one point chafing at a question about a ""credit crunch"" facing the system following the collapse of three US banks last month.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon testifies at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2022. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""I wouldn't use the word credit crunch, if I were you,"" Dimon said. ""Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening. And most of that will be around certain real estate things.""Some analysts who follow the industry agreed. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo wrote in a note Friday that “there is no evidence of a banking crisis except that it seems that JPM has been a port in the storm.” UBS titled its note about the bank results this way: “What crisis? The banking industry flexes back.”Lending rose among all banks in the week ending April 5, according to new Fed data released Friday. And so did deposits, by $61.5 billion.Challenges aheadEven if this is no longer a crisis, it was still clear from the results that the industry faces a number of challenges that will continue to test even the biggest and most resilient banks while pressuring some of their smaller, weaker rivals.Story continuesChief among them is the effect that higher interest rates have on deposits and loans, or more specifically a key measure of profitability known as net interest income. It is the difference between what a bank earns on its loans and pays out on its deposits.The rise in interest rates over the past year boosted this measure of income for some of these large banks, including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, because it allowed them to charge more for their loans. JPMorgan's net interest income was up 48% compared to the year-ago quarter, and it raised its net interest income expectation for all of 2023 to $81 billion.But the concern now is that those margins could begin to fall across the industry as institutions that don’t have the heft of JPMorgan begin to pay more aggressively for deposits, hoping that higher rates will keep their funding intact.At PNC and Wells Fargo, net interest income actually fell when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022; PNC said it expects this income to be down 2-4% in the second quarter. Dimon admitted in a call with reporters that JPMorgan’s net interest income ""will come down significantly next year and I think that's a more important statement than what it is for this year.""Wells Fargo and PNC stock ended Friday roughly flat, compared with a 7.5% rise at JPMorgan and a 4.8% rise at Citigroup.Thinning marginsThose pressures are even more acute for small banks that depend on loans for much of their profits and can’t turn to investment banking or trading for additional revenue.When one small Southern institution, Bank of South Carolina (BKSC), announced its earnings last Tuesday its president warned in a release that the bank was behind in its profit plan for the first three months of the year because of “precipitous increases in our deposit costs to meet the intense competition.” Loan interest income was up but “our margins remain thin.”Stocks of some regional lenders dropped Friday, especially those that received more investor scrutiny following the failures last month of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Truist (TFC), one of the biggest regionals in the US, was down 1.7%. Smaller regionals PacWest (PACW) and Western Alliance (WAL) were down 1.7% and 1.5% while First Republic (FRC) and Zions (ZION) lost more than 3%.The results from the biggest banks offered other warnings about possible trouble to come. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, for example, are both preparing for the possibility that credit conditions could worsen.JPMorgan increased its provision for credit losses by 56% compared to a year ago, a sign that it expects more debt to go bad as the economy slows. Wells Fargo put aside $1.2 billion for credit losses, including a $643 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate loans, as well as an increase for credit card and auto loans. Some analysts expect commercial real estate to be a problem for some banks as developers struggle to pay their debts.“While most consumers remain resilient, we’ve seen some consumer financial health trends gradually weakening from a year ago, and we’ve continued to take credit tightening actions to position the portfolio for a slowing economy,” Wells Fargo CFO Michael Santomassimo said on an earnings call.Fraser, Citigroup’s CEO, said the bank expected recent industry turmoil to cause “credit to contract,” meaning it’s “more likely that the US will enter into a shallow recession” late in the year.Such a recession “could be exacerbated in depth and duration in a more severe credit crunch.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 14, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.William S. DemchakThank you, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you can see on the slide, our quarterly results were strong, and we reported $1.7 billion in net income or $3.98 per share. Inside of this, we grew deposits and loans, increased our capital and liquidity positions, generated positive operating leverage and maintained strong credit quality. For the past month, we've seen market volatility across the broader industry. And while we take this situation seriously and are closely monitoring the environment, it's important to note that these events have taken place within a few banks with very unique business models. Inside of our company, we really haven't seen any meaningful impacts from the events of the past month. Our balance sheet remains strong and stable, and we are operating the company in the same way we were at the beginning of March. Ultimately, over time, we expect the dynamics playing out in the banking system today to contribute to changes in the competitive landscape. And while it's still early innings, we believe that PNC will be a beneficiary from this process. That said, in the near term, we're not immune to the competitive environment and the deposit dynamics that will ultimately impact our NII in the near term, and Rob is going to cover that in more detail in a second. We remain focused on growing relationships across our lines of business, and we continue to execute on key priorities, including the expansion in the BBVA legacy markets. Rob will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment. However, for this particular call, he'll review our first quarter earnings in a slightly condensed manner to allow time to also cover key balance sheet focus points that have been top of mind for our investors in the last couple of weeks. And of course, following that, we'll be able to discuss your specific questions in the Q&amp;A segment. Finally, I'd like to thank our 61,000 employees for helping deliver a strong quarter and everything they do to support our customers. Now with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.Story continuesRobert Q. ReillyThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Loans for the first quarter were $326 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion or 1% linked quarter. Investment securities were relatively stable at $143 billion. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $34 billion and increased $4 billion during the quarter. Deposits of $436 billion grew on both, a spot and average basis linked quarter. Average borrowed funds increased $4 billion, which reflected fourth quarter 2022 activity as well as senior note issuances in January of this year. At quarter end, our tangible book value was $76.90 per common share, an increase of 7% linked quarter. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% as of March 31, 2023. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion of capital to shareholders which included $600 million of common dividends and approximately $370 million of share repurchases or 2.4 million shares. Due to market conditions and increased economic uncertainty, we expect to reduce our share repurchase activity in the second quarter. And of course, we'll continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate. Slide 5 shows our loans and deposits in more detail. During the first quarter, loan balances averaged $326 billion, an increase of $4 billion or 1%, largely reflecting the full quarter impact of growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. Deposits averaged $436 billion in the first quarter, increasing $1.3 billion. We continue to see a mix shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, and I will cover that in more detail in a few minutes. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits has increased to 1.66% during the first quarter from 1.07% in the fourth quarter of 2022. And as of March 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 35%. Turning to the income statement on Slide 6. As you can see, first quarter 2023 reported net income was $1.7 billion or $3.98 per share. Total revenues of $5.6 billion decreased to $160 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Net interest income decreased $99 million or 3% primarily driven by 2 fewer days in the quarter and higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets. Our net interest margin of 2.84%, declined 8 basis points reflecting the increased funding costs, I just mentioned. Noninterest income also declined 3% or $61 million as growth in asset management and brokerage was more than offset by a general slowdown in capital markets activity as well as seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes. First quarter expenses declined $153 million or 4% linked quarter, even after accounting for the increase to the FDIC's deposit assessment rate which equated to $25 million. Provision was $235 million in the first quarter and included the impact of updated economic assumptions as well as changes in portfolio composition and quality. And our effective tax rate was 17.2%. Turning to Slide 7. We highlight our revenue and expense trends. As a result of our diversified revenue streams and expense management efforts, we generated positive operating leverage of 2% linked quarter and 15% compared to the same period a year ago. And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2023 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we will achieve our full year target. And as you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business [in] technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 8. Nonperforming loans remained stable at $2 billion and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion declined $164 million or 11% linked quarter. Notably, the delinquency rate of 41 basis points is our lowest level in over a decade. Net charge-offs were $195 million, a decrease of $29 million linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points in the first quarter. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on March 31, essentially stable with year-end 2022. Before I provide an update on our forward guidance, as Bill mentioned, we want to take a deeper dive into some of the key balance sheet items that are top of mind in the current environment related to deposits, securities and swaps, capital and liquidity, and the impact of potential regulatory changes, and finally, office exposure within our commercial portfolio. In our view, we believe we're well positioned across all these key areas of focus. Turning to Slide 10. Our $437 billion deposit base is broken down between consumer and commercial categories to give you a view of the composition and granularity of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, our deposits were 53% consumer and 47% commercial. Inside of our $230 billion of consumer deposits, approximately 90% are FDIC insured. The portfolio is very granular with an average account balance of approximately $11,500 across nearly 20 million accounts throughout our coast-to-coast franchise. Our $207 billion of commercial deposits are 20% insured, but importantly, approximately 95% of the total balances are held in operating and relationship accounts. These include deposits held as compensating balances to pay for treasury management fees, escrow deposits at Midland loan services and broader relationship accounts, all of which tend to provide more stability than deposit-only accounts. Importantly, we have approximately 1.4 million commercial deposit accounts, representing a diverse set of industries and geographies. Turning to Slide 11. We highlight our mix of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. Our consumer deposits, noninterest-bearing mix has been stable, remaining at 10% compared to the same period a year ago. The commercial side is where we expected to see a continued shift from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing deposits as rates have risen and that has played out, albeit at a somewhat faster pace than we had expected.The commercial noninterest-bearing portion of total deposits was 45% as of March 31, down from 58% a year ago. Importantly, commercial noninterest-bearing deposits include the compensating balances and Midland escrow deposits, I mentioned previously, which provides support to this mix through time. On a consolidated basis, our level of noninterest-bearing deposits was 27% at the end of the first quarter of 2023, down from 33% a year ago. PNC has historically operated with a higher percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits relative to the banking industry due in part to the strength of our treasury management business and granular deposit base. As a result, we expect our noninterest-bearing portion of deposits to continue to exceed industry averages, and approach the mid-20% range by year-end 2023. In addition to our mix shift, we have seen a faster increase in our deposit cost this year as the Federal Reserve has continued to raise short-term interest rates. Slide 12 shows our recent trends and our current expectations for deposit betas through the end of 2023. The increase in our current deposit beta expectations are largely driven by recent events that have increased the intensity and focus on rates paid and ultimately, has added incremental pricing pressure sooner than we previously expected. We expect the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in May. This, coupled with heightened competition for deposits, has accelerated our expectations to the level and pace of beta increase. And we now expect to reach a terminal beta of 42% by year-end. Slide 13 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Our securities balance averaged $143 billion in the first quarter and were relatively stable linked quarter. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 13 basis points to 2.49%, as we continue to replace runoff at higher reinvestment rates. Yields on new purchases during the quarter exceeded 4.75%. Our portfolio is high quality and positioned with a short duration of 4.3 years, meaningfully shorter than many of our peers. Approximately 2/3 of our securities are recorded as held to maturity, and 1/3 is available for sale. Average security balances represent approximately 28% of interest-earning assets. Our Received Fixed Swaps pointing to the loan book remained largely stable at $42 billion in notional value and 2.25-year duration. At the end of the first quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss improved by $1.1 billion or 10% to $9.1 billion, driven by the impact of lower interest rates during the quarter and normal accretion as the securities and swaps pulled apart. Slide 14 highlights the pace of expected security and swap maturities as well as the related AOCI runoff. By the end of 2024, we expect about 26% of our securities and swaps to roll off. This will drive increases in our securities and commercial loan yields as well as meaningful tangible book value improvement as we expect approximately 40% AOCI accretion by the end of year 2024. Slide 15 highlights our strong liquidity position. Our strong liquidity coverage ratios continued to improve in the first quarter and exceeded regulatory requirements throughout the quarter. Our cash balance is at the Federal Reserve totaled $34 billion, and we maintained substantial unused borrowing capacity and flexibility through other funding sources. PNC has a robust liquidity management process, which includes a required statutory daily liquidity coverage ratio assessment as well as a monthly net stable funding ratio calculation. In addition, we performed monthly internal liquidity stress testing that covers a range of time horizons as well as systemic and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Our mix of borrowed funds to total liabilities has historically averaged approximately 17% and reached an unprecedented low level of 6% in 2021. On March 31, our mix was 12%, and we expect to move closer to the historical average over time. In light of the current environment, we anticipate that we will be subject to a total loss absorbing capacity requirement in some form and at some point, with a reasonable phase-in period. Importantly, as our borrowed funds continue to return to a more normalized level, we would expect to be compliant through our current issuance plans under existing TLAC requirements. Slide 16 shows our solid capital position with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% at quarter end. As a Category 3 institution, we don't include AOCI in our CET1 ratio, but I understand why there is focus on this ratio with the inclusion of AOCI. As of March 31, 2023, our CET1 ratio, including AOCI, was estimated to be 7.5%, which remains above our 7.4% required level, taking into account our current stress capital buffer. However, we also believe it's important to take a look at the balance sheet positioning of the bank from a market value of equity perspective, similar to our understanding of Basel IRRBB rules. Market value of equity doesn't truly get reflected on the balance sheet today due to generally accepted accounting principles, which results in a skewed approach valuating certain items primarily on the asset side. While AOCI takes into account the current valuation of the securities and certain portions of our swap portfolios, it does not account for the valuation of the deposit book which can be a meaningful offset in a rising interest rate environment. In fact, looking at PNC's change in market value of equity over the past year, the increase in the market value of our deposits and the rapidly rising interest rate environment has significantly outpaced all unrealized losses on the asset side of the balance sheet, including securities and fixed rate loans. Total market value of equity increased substantially in the rising rate environment, and further, our duration of equity is now essentially 0 and well positioned in the current environment. Importantly, our models use conservative assumptions regarding estimates for betas, mix, balances and deposit (inaudible). We also recognized early on that large inflows of deposits during the pandemic were driven by a combination of QE and fiscal stimulus, which were likely to be short-lived. Recall our Fed balances peaked in the first quarter of 2021 around $86 billion. As a result, we modeled an economic value associated with those deposits at a fraction of the value of core deposits. Turning to Slide 17. I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about our commercial real estate portfolio. While credit quality is strong across the majority of our CRE book, office is a segment receiving a lot of attention in this environment due to the shift to remote work and higher interest rates. So we thought it would be worthwhile to highlight our exposure and our position with this portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, we had $8.9 billion or 2.7% of our total loans in our office portfolio. Turning to Slide 18. You can see the composition of this portfolio, which is well diversified across geography, tenant type and property classification. Reserves against these loans, which we have built over several quarters, now totaled 7.1%, a level that we believe adequately covers expected losses. In regard to our underwriting approach, we adhere to conservative standards, focus on attractive markets and work with experienced, well-capitalized sponsors. The office portfolio was originated with an approximate loan to value of 55% to 60%, and a significant majority of those properties are defined as Class A. We have a highly experienced team that is reviewing each asset in the portfolio to set appropriate action plans and test reserve adequacy. We don't solely rely on third-party appraisals, which will naturally be slow to adjust to the rapidly shifting market conditions. Rather, we are stress testing property performance to set realistic expectations. To appropriately sensitize our portfolio, we've significantly discounted net operating income levels and property values across the entire office book. Additionally, tenant retention, build-out costs and concession levels are all updated to accurately reflect market conditions. Credit quality in our office portfolio remains strong today with only 0.2% of loans delinquent, 3.5% nonperforming and a net charge-off rate of 47 basis points over the last 12 months. Along those lines, we continue to see solid performance within the single tenant, medical and government loans, which represent 40% of our total office portfolio. These have occupancy levels above 90% and (inaudible) levels of 3% or less. Where we do see increasing stress and a rising level of criticized assets, is in our multi-tenant loans, which represents 58% of our office portfolio. Multi-tenant loans are currently running in the mid-70% occupancy range. (inaudible) levels are greater than 30% and 60% of the portfolio is scheduled to mature by the end of 2024. In the near term, this is our primary concern area as it relates to expected losses and by extension, comprises the largest portion of our office reserves. Multi-tenant reserves on a stand-alone basis are 9.4%. Obviously, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect real-time market conditions. For each of the key areas of focus, I just discussed, we believe we are well positioned. And Slide 19 summarizes our balance sheet strength during this volatile time. Our deposits are up, our capital and liquidity positions are strong, and our overall credit quality is solid. In summary, PNC reported a strong first quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we are expecting a recession starting in the second half of 2023, resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path assumption includes a 25-basis point increase in the Fed funds rate in May. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until early 2024, when we expect a 25-basis point cut. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows. We expect spot loan growth of 1% to 3%, which equates to average loan growth of 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth to be up 4% to 5%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up 6% to 8%. At this point, visibility remains challenging, and our full year NII guidance assumes the continuation of the recent intensity on deposit pricing, which is being driven by recent events. We expect noninterest income to be stable, expenses to be up 2% to 3%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we will generate positive operating leverage in 2023. Looking at the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2023, we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be down 2% to 4%, fee income to be stable to down 1%. Other noninterest income to be between $200 million and $250 million excluding net securities and Visa activity. Taking all the component pieces, we expect total revenue to decline approximately 3%. We expect total noninterest expense to be up 1% to 2%, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. Further, given our strong credit metrics, our credit quality is trending better than our expectations. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Lynn GraseckFirst off, I just want to say, your slide deck is phenomenal. I just -- you answered so many of the questions that I had coming into this, I felt like you were reading my mind ahead of this call.William S. DemchakCould have been, yes. Thank you, the team did a nice job putting that together. Thank you for recognizing that.Betsy Lynn GraseckNo, it was great. You guys -- this is a great job. I have 2 questions. One is on the beta, the deposit beta. When you're talking about the 42%, obviously, that is aligned with the outlook that you just expressed for interest rate movements. I guess I wanted to just understand how you're thinking about the flex between deposit beta and deposit growth, because part of me says, ""Hey, I could have expected even more deposit growth than you gave me, QQ."" and is there a rate paid element to that, that maybe you're holding back on and that's why the deposits weren't maybe as high as what some folks like me had hoped.William S. DemchakWe're sitting here puzzled. We grew deposits average and spot against a backdrop of absent the volatility in the market deposit still overall leaving the system, particularly in the government money funds and then the shrinkage of the total -- on above QT. Our rate paid -- if you look year-on-year, I think our total deposits are down 3% or something, which is less than most anybody would compare to. And we have purposefully been protecting the franchise in the course of doing that, I recognize some other people don't do that, and that's -- we'll see how that plays out through time. But we kind of feel we outperformed on deposits, so a little bit in the first quarter, yes.Betsy Lynn GraseckYes. No, I QQ definitely, and I would expect after all of the banks finish reporting, we can have a better conversation on this. I was just wondering if you felt that if you had a slightly higher rate paid, would you have pulled in more? And I suppose the way you answered that question is you don't feel the need to. So that's great. And then just separately, as a fallout of what has happened with (inaudible) signature, et cetera, do you feel like there's any need at all to reassess the duration of the commercial operating account deposit liability, life. Is that something that having seen what happened at (inaudible) you would want to take a closer look at? Or do you feel like it's just such a different animal given what you outlined on Slide 10 with the granularity you've got.William S. DemchakWell, first of all, we look at that all the time. And as Rob put into his comments, a large portion of the deposit growth that we saw through COVID, so stimulus in the growth in the Fed's balance sheet. We just assumed had a life of a day, 0, because we're in an abnormal period of time. The core operating deposits that we have, particularly as you go in the middle market, are basically the monies -- the working capital monies that companies use to run their companies. We truncate and always have truncated the modeled lives of those deposits well below what the practical experience would show us, yes. So it's conservative.Robert Q. ReillyAnd deposits are spread out over diverse industries and diverse geographies.William S. DemchakAnd accounts -- you almost can't compare what happened at Silicon Valley and Signature to any other bank I've ever seen in terms of the concentration of the deposit accounts.Robert Q. ReillyAnd the nature of the clients.William S. DemchakIt's just the nature of them. I mean a lot of that money was -- it's capital raise money that was sitting there.OperatorOur next question from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.Michael Lawrence MayoI guess this question goes in the category of no good deed goes unpunished. Your operating leverage in the first quarter year-over-year was over 10%. You've guided for positive operating leverage this year of 1% to 3%. Your cycle-to-date beta, I estimate being below 40%. So all that looks really good, but on the other hand, you did, I guess, lower your guidance for how much positive operating leverage this year. You mentioned NII, you mentioned the intensity on deposit pricing. So just can you help talk about the tradeoff of pursuing growth with [core] deposits versus maybe scaling back if that deposit pricing is more intense? Or do you see that not being so at some point?William S. DemchakI think, Mike, the part of the issue that we face here is you have an interest rate forward curve that's suggesting cuts out there. So if you believe that, betas would be less. We kind of think the Fed's going to hold through the year and cut next year. Personally, I think they might hold longer than that. So everybody's NII guide is going to be all over the place depending on what they actually think the Fed is doing as we go into this, the back end of this year. Separately, we have seen just this heightened awareness of interest rates and what you do with deposits on the back of the banks have failed. You've seen the growth in the government money funds on the back of the Fed's reverse repo facility, which is a real thing. As long as they allow that to keep growing, they're at the market deposits, but they're basically getting drained from the banking system and making liquidity more expensive. So that's -- we took all that into account and said, look, if rates are higher for longer, if the Fed keeps draining deposits through its reverse repo facility, the smaller banks really need to pay up at super high rates to fund their balance sheets. It's going to be painful for us, and that's what we put in our guide. That may or may not happen.Robert Q. ReillyAnd I would just add, we've got a focus on our core franchise and our clients. So on the commercial side, it's really the effect of commercial clients choosing to switch to interest-bearing from noninterest bearing. And the relationship is fully intact. And then on the consumer side, as Bill just mentioned, the interest-bearing deposits and the pressure around rates paid there.Michael Lawrence MayoAnd the one other point you guys have made is that either NII will be better or you might have to -- you might get to release some of your credit reserves. Have you seen any improvement in that loan pricing commensurate with some of the standards and the capital markets, you're pricing for risk a lot more and in the lending markets, you have not been pricing for risk and you brought that up before. Are you seeing that at all or still not yet?William S. DemchakOur new production is a little bit better than it was, but in fairness, at the moment, credit looks much better than we otherwise would have assumed. So it's a trade-off. Now it's going to be interesting, Mike, because the marginal cost of funds for the U.S. banking system has just gone up a lot as a result of this flurry. And so all else equal, you would expect credit spreads to widen here, simply because the cost of funds for all banks has gone up. I haven't seen that play out yet, but it continues to be at least my expectation that it will.OperatorOur next question comes from the line Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Gerard Sean CassidyCan you give us -- you guys pointed out about, Rob, the expectations on TLAC in your prepared remarks, but can you guys give us some color on what changes may come as a result of the Signature and Silicon Valley bank failures, the regulators look like they're going to reassess the situation. We'll get the postmortem on May 1, of course. But what do you guys think may happen in terms of additional requirements for regional banks like yours? And I know TLAC, you're already planning on that, but outside of TLAC.William S. DemchakI don't know what it is they might do. There's a lot of talk around, should they eliminate the available for sale, opt in or opt out for the AOCI for banks our size. And they may well do that. Part of me though, the reason we put economic value of equity in our presentation is, as soon as you start isolating specific fixed rate assets and ignore others, so what do you do with fixed rate whole loan mortgages? What do you do with held -- it's all the same stuff. It's an accounting entry. And so I would hope that they would have a more holistic look as they do in Europe on measuring balance sheet risk to interest rates. I don't know where that's going to end up. And whatever it is they do is going to take a period of time. TLAC, I think, is a certainty at this point. It's a function of how much it will be and whether it's varied as a function of size and complexity of bank.Robert Q. ReillyThere's some tailoring.Gerard Sean CassidyGo ahead, Rob.Robert Q. ReillyThose are the 2 prominent subjects, TLAC and AOCI inclusion.William S. DemchakBut by the way, the issue, it's just -- it's worth mentioning basic interest rate risk management and the test around liquidity that banks go through, I mean, we did this, we run this stuff every single day with all sorts of different scenarios and the regulators require us to and we get measured on it (inaudible). Like I don't even know who was looking at these other banks. It's -- so to come in and say we ought to do more, we're already doing it is, I guess, my point.Gerard Sean CassidyVery clear. And I'm glad you guys put the whole balance sheet, the equity valuation because that message has to get out, and I'm glad you guys did that. Moving on to commercial and industrial loans, you guys have seen really good growth over the past year. Can you give us a little more color on, do you see reintermediation coming into the banking system because the capital markets are still disrupted? Or is it just you guys have had success with BBVA and that's working for you? Can you give us some color on that growth that you're seeing?William S. DemchakA couple of comments. If you look back through our history, when we enter new markets, this is particularly through factor [RBC] and what we've seen with BBVA. We tend to grow loans at a pace in the new markets that would be above what you would expect as a long-term trend. And then over time, we cross-sell into those new relationships. So almost think of it as it's kind of advertising dollars (inaudible) otherwise participate in a deal and I hope that you're going to get TM revenue and other things. What we'll see going forward is the cross-sell into the new relationships we've established. The ability to continue to grow loans at that pace should we choose to is probably still there. Do you get paid for it today the way you did when rates were much lower? That's a tougher question. Now the whole reintermediation in the banks from capital markets. I've heard some of that buzz. By the way, I've heard the buzz the other way. All else equal, I suspect the long-term trend will be less in the banking system and more out of the banking system over a long, long period of time, notwithstanding what happens in the near future.OperatorNext question from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.John G. PancariI agree on the slide deck, very, very helpful detail. On the deposit front, just a couple of additional bit of detail, the beta expectation of terminal be 42% looks a little bit more conservative than the group and probably appropriately so. So it's good to see it. Can you maybe give us how that breaks down by way of commercial deposit beta expectation at this point versus consumer?Robert Q. ReillyYes, sure. John, it's Rob. The way that we look at it in terms of determining where we're going to end up, and again, it's an expectation. We'll see how it plays out ultimately, but you're on the right track. So if you take a look at our total deposits of $437 billion and you take commercial and the high net worth, the consumer portion of it is high net worth, which is around $230 billion, those betas have moved. They're already a terminal, it's done. So that leaves roughly $200 billion or so in consumer deposits, as I mentioned in my comments, 10% of those are noninterest-bearing, which are transactional accounts, we don't expect a change. So you're at $170 billion, the minority of our total deposits of interest-bearing consumer deposits that are sort of in play and that we expect to pay higher rates on. So that's how we get to maybe a more conservative number than what you're seeing on peers that don't have the same mix.John G. PancariOkay. That's helpful. Also on the deposit front, if I could also get a little more detail on the amount of inflows that you may have seen during the March time period around the failures. Can you maybe quantify the amount and if you expect any outflow of any of those inputs that you saw?Robert Q. ReillySo we did see in mid-March. We saw some inflows during that week that at the height of the disruption, but a lot of that's settled out. So we don't expect to see that be a factor for us positively or negatively as we move into the second quarter.William S. DemchakThe only thing I'd say, we actually opened in March, twice the number of accounts in our C&amp;I franchise that we would otherwise open in a month. So away from the deposits that came in, we actually got a bunch of clients. The deposits will stay and get mixed, some will go, but we grew our account portfolio pretty substantially in one month.John G. PancariOkay. Great. If I could put one more in there. Just on the office front, do you happen to have perhaps the refreshed LTVs that you're starting to see in that portfolio?William S. DemchakIt's a good question, and I haven't seen them, but it's worth. I don't know we put in the deck or not, but we underwrite to what 55 to 60.Robert Q. Reilly55 to 60.William S. DemchakAnd all of that stuff is stale and all the appraisals that you get are stale. And so in effect, what we end up doing is you assume that less leases renew than you otherwise would in a normal cash flow analysis. You dropped that pretty materially. You assume that lease rates, all else equal, are going to go down and then you have to put in the rehab costs to re-lease it. And then you discounted at a lower rate. So we've done all that building by building and then taking reserves against it. And I guess a final point I'd make, you think about Rob's number, it was at 9.6% we have against...Robert Q. ReillyMulti-tenant, right.William S. DemchakEffectively, you're saying, all right, I can have 20% of Class A office default and lose $0.50 on the dollar on a portfolio that was originally underwritten at 60%. That's a pretty severe outcome.Robert Q. ReillyYes. And I would just add to that, John. So Bill mentioned it, we have a relatively small portfolio. So we're able to go asset by asset rather than just broad strokes across a general portfolio.William S. DemchakWe -- look, we know how to do this, but we've been in the business for a long time. We have all the resources and have seen the activity in Midland. We know all the borrowers we're with. And we think we've laid it out pretty clearly. We're going to have charge-offs, but we've...Robert Q. ReillyThat's why we built reserves.William S. DemchakWhere they're coming from and we've built the reserves.OperatorNext question from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.Bill CarcacheBill and Rob, I wanted to follow up on the deposit beta commentary. Rob, you mentioned that mid-20% noninterest-bearing deposit mix that's implicit, I believe, in your 42% terminal beta assumption. It looks like that would get you back to pre-COVID levels on Slide 11, I think. How are you thinking about the risk that noninterest-bearing mix will continue to fall, not just the pre-COVID levels but potentially even lower? Perhaps some have talked about...Robert Q. ReillyYes, we can see and we take a look at the nature of the accounts, mid-20s is our estimate. It could go lower. Our expectations are, though, that it would be in the mid-20s. And that's really on the basis of the nature of the operating accounts that we have, but as we just were mentioning, we know really well, and we know the nature of their activities. So it's really a knowledge of our operating book that gives us that indication.Bill CarcacheUnderstood. And then separately, following up on your commentary around potential regulatory uncertainty. In light of bars, your recent Senate testimony, I was hoping you could address broadly how you're all thinking about the levers at your disposal to the extent that the regulatory environment grows more challenging, certainly, your -- it seems like you're well positioned, but in terms of levers, whether it's RWA growth, buyback, dividend, if you could just frame how you think about those to the extent that it does get more challenging?William S. DemchakNot sure -- if you put AOCI in, we're already kind of over the threshold. All else equal, I think we're well positioned and fine. We -- as Rob mentioned, we're at least at the moment, being conservative on our thoughts on share repurchase, but most of that is to kind of laid out the current environment, get through earnings and see where we are. I don't see any issue coming out of regulation that we won't be able to handle in the due course.Robert Q. ReillyAnd that would largely be in the obvious areas of capital and liquidity where we're strong.OperatorNext question from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.Robert Scott SiefersSo you reduced the full year '23 loan growth expectations a bit. I was wondering if you could comment for a second on how much of that is sort of lower either existing or anticipated demand? And how much is you guys just sort of being more conservative about where you'd hope to kind of direct your capital liquidity?William S. DemchakIt's a great question. It's probably 50-50. So demand has softened a little bit. And then the marginal cost of (inaudible) new clients has gone up, so a little more picky than we were. It's probably 50-50.Robert Q. ReillyAnd that spread issue that we talked about that we think that we should be paid more for the risk.Robert Scott SiefersOkay. Perfect. And then, Bill, I was hoping you could expand just a bit on that commercial account opening comment you made a couple of questions ago. Maybe as you sort of think of how the sort of the world might look going forward for commercial customers. Do you think they'll just maybe diversify their relationships to protect themselves a little? How will an operational account work? Will people just keep less in their operational accounts and sprinkle it elsewhere, any thoughts on how things might evolve?William S. DemchakI'm not sure. We haven't seen anything with our legacy clients in terms of behavior. Now they've -- we've seen money go into sweep accounts, government funds from corporates and individuals largely is a function of rate. I don't know that it has anything to do with diversification. As you go for smaller banks, I suppose that could become an issue depending on how much visibility there is into that particular bank's balance sheet, but we just haven't seen any of that.OperatorNext question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Kenneth Michael UsdinI just want to dig on the guidance a little bit. The second quarter guidance is clear for the revenue step down, and kind of that implies in the full year guide that second half revenue is pretty equal to first half revenue. I'm just wondering if you can kind of maybe give us some NII versus fees? And are you expecting any just better stability or increase as you go through the year perhaps in fees versus what might happen in NII?Robert Q. ReillyOkay. I think you're asking in terms of the full year. So we've given you the new guidance around our NII, and then we've been through that. As far as fees go, we're calling it to be stable year-over-year. And there's some moving parts in there. Some of the fee categories are doing a little better than we expected. Some are doing a little bit worse, but altogether, it's still stable.Kenneth Michael UsdinOkay. And within that, can I just ask you a question, your Harris Williams business has just been a great one over the years. In this environment, obviously, M&amp;A is slower, but is there also -- is there any sense or chance that also like midsized companies have to do a rethink here? I'm just kind of wondering just where you think the pipelines and outlook are for that business specifically.Robert Q. ReillyYes. So Harris Williams, you're accurate in terms of -- that's our biggest driver of our capital markets advisory businesses. And they had a slower than usual quarter in the first quarter, obviously reflecting a lot of the disruption. And the pipelines are still pretty good. We're not expecting a big rebound in the second quarter, but potentially in the second half. But to your point, a lot of that depends on the psychology at the time. And the ability and the support for both, buyers and sellers, to do deals.Kenneth Michael UsdinRob, one more quick one. I know your footnote on your beta slide says that you don't include time deposits in your beta count. So are we generally to assume that the beta on time deposits is obviously very high, just given what we know to the early point that Bill made about industry funding costs?Robert Q. ReillyYes, that's right. And again, that's a conventional measure. So that's not our own personal PNC measure. That's how the industry calculates it.Operator(Operator Instructions). Next question from the line (inaudible) with Point72.Unidentified AnalystA quick question, if I may, on the commercial real estate, a follow-up one on criticized loans on Slide 18. That 20% as much as your -- the rest of your commercial real estate book. So I would just like to understand what was this number before and how you would expect this number to evolve from here?Robert Q. ReillyI'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't follow all of that.Unidentified AnalystOn Slide 18, you mentioned that your office size loan ratio is 20%. I just would like to know what was this number before for previous quarters? And how do you expect this number to evolve from here.Robert Q. ReillySo the 2.7%, it's been pretty steady. So it's been a small percentage of our total commercial real estate. It hasn't changed nor do we expect it, certainly not to go up.OperatorNext question from the line of Alan Davis, NatWest markets.Unidentified AnalystAlan Davis here from NatWest Markets. Just a very quick question and echo what everybody said that the disclosure and information here is fantastic. With all the market noise that went on after SVB, and I totally get the difference, and I totally agree with what you're saying about the accounting standards and so on. Nevertheless, there's a lot of keen interest in the unrealized losses on the hold-to-maturity portfolio. Are you able to provide any color or guidance there? I don't think all of that would be in AOCI. Is there anything that you can help guide me with in that regard?William S. DemchakTo add-on held to maturity, so inside of AOCI today is one number, and then we have another smaller loss in held to maturity, which we disclosed.Robert Q. Reilly$3.5 billion.OperatorWe have no further questions on the phone line.Bryan K. GillOkay. Well, thank you for joining our call and your interest in PNC. And if you have any other additional questions or need follow-up, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you, bye.William S. DemchakThanks, everybody.Robert Q.

That compares with their week-ago forecast for a 5.2% decline in the quarter.S&amp;P 500 earnings fell 3.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, based on Refinitiv data, which means the first quarter still would mark a second straight quarterly decline in U.S. earnings, or a profit recession.Investors have been eagerly awaiting quarterly results from banks following the collapse of two U.S. regional banks in March.While shares of JPMorgan and other big banks rallied following Friday's results, shares of regional bank PNC Financial Services Group Inc were little changed after it posted a quarterly profit beat but missed expectations on net interest income.A slew of other regional banks are still due to report in the coming weeks, while quarterly results are due next week from Goldman Sachs Group and Netflix.

Stocks forfeited gains following these headlines and steady selling in the major indexes pushed stocks to session lows in early afternoon trade before an afternoon rebound.""These expectations have been seesawing for four consecutive months, alternating between increases and decreases,"" said Joanne Hsu, director for the survey of consumers. ""Uncertainty over short-run inflation expectations continues to be notably elevated, indicating that the recent volatility in expected year-ahead inflation is likely to continue.""Overall, the report showed sentiment was ""essentially unchanged"" in April, as the index stood at 63.5, up from 62 at the end of March. This data came about an hour after Fed Governor Chris Waller reiterated in a speech that inflation remains ""much too high.""Story continuesElsewhere on the economic calendar the monthly report on retail sales showed sales fell 1% in March while industrial production data came in better than expected.""Overall, [retail sales were] not quite as bad as we had expected,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. ""Thanks to the strong January, first-quarter real consumption growth should be close to 4.5%, with GDP growth at 1.8%, which might be enough to persuade the Fed to hike by a final 25bp in early May.""Banks results shineJPMorgan, the country's largest bank by assets, saw shares rise more than 7% after reporting top- and bottom-line results that surged from the prior year.Deposits, which will be closely tracked by investors this quarter following the failure of three US banks in March, rose 1.5% over the quarter at JPMorgan. Compared to the same period last year, however, deposits fell 7%.In the company's earnings release, CEO Jamie Dimon said, ""the U.S. economy continues to be on generally healthy footings—consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon, and the banking industry turmoil adds to these risks.""Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, arrives for the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing titled Annual Oversight of the Nations Largest Banks, in Hart Building on Thursday, September 22, 2022.

Wells Fargo reported its loans extended to commercial clients rose 15% from the same period last year.Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in a release, ""We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the U.S. financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry.""Citi reported income and revenue that rose 7% and 12% from the prior year, respectively, while highlighting its deposits stood at $1.3 trillion at end of the quarter, ""largely unchanged"" from the prior year, the company said in its release. CEO Jane Fraser said the company's performance came ""despite the tumultuous environment for banks.""Elsewhere on the earnings side, BlackRock's (BLK) results showed the impact last year's market turmoil had on investors as the firm's average assets under management dipped below $9 trillion during the first quarter, down from $9.7 trillion in the same quarter last year. Revenue at the asset management giant also fell 10% from last year to $4.24 billion.""BlackRock is a source of both stability and optimism for clients,"" CEO Larry Fink said in a release.

Per our estimate, the metric was $3.64 per share.Shares of PNC rose 1.1% in pre-market trading following better-than-expected results. A full-day trading session will depict a clearer picture.Results were aided by an increase in net interest income (NII), supported by higher rates and loan growth. However, rising expenses and higher provisions were headwinds.Net income was $1.69 billion, higher than $1.43 billion in the prior-year quarter. Our model estimated this to be $1.62 billion.Revenues and Expenses RiseTotal quarterly revenues were $5.6 billion, up 19.4% year over year. The top line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We expected the figure to be $5.63 billion.Quarterly NII was $3.59 billion, improved 27.9% from the year-ago quarter. The upswing is attributable to higher interest-earning asset yields and balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. The net interest margin increased 56 basis points to 2.84%. Our estimate for the metric was $3.63 billion.Non-interest income increased 6.9% year over year to $2.02 billion. Growth in business operations across the franchise along with higher private equity revenues have resulted in the upsurge, partially offset by the impact of lower average equity markets during the quarter. Except asset management and brokerage fees, all fee income components witnessed growth. Our estimate was $2 billion.Non-interest expenses totaled $3.32 billion, increasing 4.7% from the year-ago figure. All cost components, excep occupancy costs, increased.The efficiency ratio was 59% compared with 68% in the year-ago quarter. A lower efficiency ratio indicates higher profitability.As of Mar 31, 2023, total loans were $326.48 billion, increased marginally on a sequential basis. Also, total deposits increased marginally from the end of the previous quarter to $436.83 billion.Story continuesCredit Quality: A Mixed BagThe company reported provision for credit losses of $235 million in the first quarter against the recapture of credit losses of $208 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net loan charge-offs were $195 million, up 42.3% year over year. Also, the allowance for credit losses increased 4.2% to $5.41 billion.Nonetheless, non-performing loans decreased 12.5% year over year to $2.01 billion.Capital Position Weakens, Profitability Ratios ImproveAs of Mar 31, 2023, the Basel III common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 9.2% compared with 9.9% as of Mar 31, 2022.Return on average assets and average common shareholders’ equity were 1.22% and 16.11%, respectively, compared with 1.05% and 11.64% witnessed in the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment ActivityIn the first quarter of 2023, PNC Financial returned $1 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares of $0.6 billion and share repurchases amounting to $0.4 billion.Our ViewpointPNC Financial is well-poised to grow on the back of its diverse revenue mix. Its balance sheet strength is likely to aid financials.

Invariably, in this investing game, you’re going to pick a few clunkers – we all do. What separates successful players from those who consistently struggle often comes down to hard decision-making.Essentially, the concept of stocks to sell ranks similar to judging a talent show: some folks are talented, and most are not. And you just have to deliver the bad news rather than leading deluded hopefuls on. To add some objectivity to this unpleasant exercise, each of the names below incurred consensus analyst sell ratings. So, see if you need to do some spring cleaning.BBBYBed Bath &amp; Beyond$0.31LUMNLumen Technologies$2.57PFGPrincipal Financial Group$75.56BENFranklin Resources$27.16EXPDExpeditors International$109.06PNWPinnacle West$80.05CLXClorox$159.11InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockA once-popular household goods retailer, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) may be delaying its inevitable demise. In the five sessions ending April 6, BBBY stock suffered a steep loss of more than 43%. And that’s despite the fact that the company secured a $120 million merchandising lifeline. Basically, investors realize that the enterprise sits on borrowed time.Despite the deal with ReStore Capital, the fundamental problem for BBBY stock centers on trust (or lack thereof). Unlike its well-capitalized competitors, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond needs to put up cash to buy the inventory to stock its shelves. Otherwise, if the retailer goes under, the product suppliers would become unsecured creditors. However, the company’s balance sheet is simply awful. Unfortunately, management must concede to dilutive deals one after the other. Eventually, investors will lose hope.Story continuesTellingly, Wall Street analysts peg BBBY as a unanimous strong sell. Ignore the triple-digit price forecast as it’s merely residue from abandoned analyst targets. Instead, BBBY clearly ranks among the stocks to sell.Lumen Technologies (LUMN)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockAn American telecommunications company, Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) offers communications, network services, security, cloud solutions, voice and managed services. Per its public profile, the company also serves global enterprise customers across North America, Latin America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. While relevant, it’s struggled for traction.Fundamentally, Lumen will lose its spot on the S&amp;P 500 index. As well, the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates amid higher crude oil prices negatively affected investor sentiment. Financially, circumstances don’t look particularly auspicious for Lumen. For example, investment resource Gurufocus labels the enterprise a possible value trap.Specifically, the company’s Altman Z-Score sits at 0.23, indicating deep distress and thus, a high risk of bankruptcy. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 4.7% below breakeven. Not surprisingly, it also posts negative net margins. Naturally, analysts peg LUMN as a moderate sell. While their average price target of $3.81 implies nearly 57% upside, you can ignore it. Instead, LUMN ranks among the stocks to sell.Principal Financial Group (PFG)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockA global financial investment management and insurance firm, Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG) on paper offers myriad relevancies. However, the recent U.S. regional bank failures imposed many questions about the viability of the economy. Combined with other ongoing concerns such as the Fed’s monetary policy, PFG struggled this year. Since the January opener, shares dropped more than 12% in equity value.Financially, the company could use some work on its balance sheet. Notably, Principal’s equity-to-asset ratio sits at 0.03 times. However, the sector median value stands at 0.83 times. Therefore, Principal ranks worse than 97.68% of its peers. Operationally, the company features a modest three-year revenue growth rate of 5.9%. However, its free cash flow growth rate during the aforementioned period sits at 14.4% below parity. Therefore, PFG makes a “strong” case for stocks to sell. Finally, analysts peg PFG as a consensus moderate sell. The lowest price target is $58, implying 21% downside risk.Franklin Resources (BEN)earningsSource: ShutterstockWith the troubles that the regional banks – and even international finance giants – courted following the much-covered bank runs, it’s no surprise that Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) struggled for traction recently. Sure, since the Jan. opener, BEN stock lost only 2%. However, in the trailing month, it’s down more than 4%, possibly suggesting the beginning of a negative trend.Financially, more investors may be taking a closer look at its stability. Right now, the company’s equity-to-asset ratio is 0.4 times. Again, the median value for the asset management industry is 0.83 times. Also, Franklin’s debt-to-equity stands at 0.86 times. Here, the sector median comes in much lower at 0.23 times. To be fair, Franklin’s three-year revenue growth rate of 14.6% beats out 65.9% of the competition.Nevertheless, investors are taking an extremely cautious approach to the financial sector. Lastly, analysts peg BEN as a consensus moderate sell. Their average price target sits at $25.56, implying nearly 4% downside risk. Thus, it’s one of the stocks to sell.Expeditors International (EXPD)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Seattle, Washington, Expeditors International (NASDAQ:EXPD) is a worldwide logistics and freight forwarding company. Though carrying a significantly relevant profile, Expeditors’ problem centers on broader economic stability concerns. Further, fierce competition may play a more impactful role moving forward. Since the January opener, EXPD gained less than half a percent.As with the other stocks to sell on this list, analysts take a dim view overall on Expeditors. To be fair, the company so far prints decent financials. For example, it has a cash-to-debt ratio of 3.92, beating out 85.41% of its rivals. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 9.45 indicates a very low risk of bankruptcy.However, EXPD appears overvalued, especially against projected earnings. Also, EXPD trades at 5.23 times book value, ranked worse than nearly 92% of sector players. While it might not be on my personal sell list, analysts peg EXPD as a consensus moderate sell. Their average price target sits at $94.67, implying over 10% downside risk.Pinnacle West Capital (PNW)stocks to sell a group of businessmen holding their thumbs down. worst investments of 2020Source: ShutterstockAnother enterprise that caught analysts’ ire, Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) is a utility holding company that owns Arizona Public Service and Bright Canyon Energy. Generally speaking, I don’t mention utilities as stocks to sell because of their natural monopoly. Basically, the barrier to entry is so steep that would-be competitors give up before they even try. Sure enough, PNW gained almost 8% since the beginning of this year.Also, Pinnacle West’s financials don’t seem terrible, especially when stacked against other utility plays. To be sure, its balance sheet could use some work. Its Altman Z-Score pings at 0.85, indicating distress and a higher risk for bankruptcy. As well, the company’s FCF growth rate pings at 25.4% below breakeven.Further, Pinnacle doesn’t seem the greatest deal on paper. For instance, it seems noticeably overvalued against projected earnings. However, most analysts don’t like it. Among eight experts, three rate it a hold, and four rate it a sell. Additionally, the average price target is $71.88, implying 10.5% downside risk.Clorox (CLX)a businessman with his thumb facing downSource: ShutterstockTo be honest, I was shocked when I found out that Wall Street considers Clorox (NYSE:CLX) to be one of the stocks to sell. As a relevant consumer goods giant, Clorox theoretically brings value to those seeking a safe place to park their funds. At the same time, I can understand why the experts don’t like it. Fundamentally, with fading fears of the Covid-19 crisis, Clorox lost its cynical upside catalyst.Regarding its financials, Clorox doesn’t feature the worst profile I’ve seen. However, investors might be questioning its balance sheet. For example, the company’s cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.05 times, ranked worse than 87.71% of its competitors. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio is also 0.05 times, worse than 93.8% of sector players.Notably, both its EBITDA and FCF growth rate over the past three years have been sitting in negative territory. Also, the market prices CLX at a forward multiple of 29.24 times. That’s way overvalued compared to the rest of the industry (a median of 17.29 times). Finally, covering analysts peg CLX as a consensus moderate sell. Their price target sits at $139.11, implying nearly 12% downside risk.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

187,7ddb210b-98d5-3c68-b356-9c950d70631d,TGT,2023-04-15,3 Retail Stocks to Buy on Sale Before They Hit All-Time Highs,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-retail-stocks-buy-sale-011432220.html,1681262072,STORY,"['HD', 'NKE', 'TGT']","[Retail stocks have been coming back to life lately, but they are far from outperforming the indices. While that may have more active investors looking away from consumer-based stocks, value-oriented investors may be looking at retail stocks to buy.There is one problem though, and that’s a potential recession. For several quarters now, investors have been worried about a looming economic slowdown. So far though, we’re not seeing any drastic declines in economic output and companies continue to generate solid results.Granted, we are in a tightening cycle and many concerns still linger. But inflation continues to run higher than normal and the labor market remains strong. That’s keeping consumer spending alive (and mostly well).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite this, most retail stocks continue to struggle. I want to look at three names that are still down more than 30% from the highs, but that I believe will go back to make new all-time highs.With that, let’s look at three retail stocks to buy.Home Depot (HD)earnings reports hdSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comLike stocks, real estate is an asset class that continues to perform well over the long term. Therefore, there’s a vested interest in keeping momentum alive in the home improvement category. Note how the rapid rise in interest rates has yet to really trigger large declines in the housing market. That may come in time should we see a recession, but for now, it’s holding up pretty well.In that vein, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) should continue to perform well over the long term too.After enjoying a strong boom during the Covid-19 years, Home Depot stock has fallen on tough times. Shares have almost doubled off the 2020 low, but are still down about 29.2% from the all-time high. It doesn’t help that analysts expect roughly flat revenue growth this year and a 5% dip in earnings.To me though, what does it matter if it takes a year or two for Home Depot stock to find its footing? It wouldn’t be too surprising if that were the case, given the run-up off the low (although I think it’s a conservative view). At the end of the day, consumers are going to continue making home improvements and in my view, that will eventually drive Home Depot stock higher.Story continuesNike (NKE)A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes. retail stocks to buySource: mimohe / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) is a top-level consumer company, which dominates with high-level athletes and performers donning the “Swoosh.” Other retailer stocks that I’m fond of, such as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), show promise for the long-term, but are approaching an all-time high. Nike still has a ways to go.Nike uses a combination of wholesale, retail and direct-to-consumer (or DTC) via online channels to drive its business. As long as consumers own houses, they’ll go to Home Depot and as long as they play sports, they’ll wear Nike.Like Home Depot though, Nike’s bottom line is under pressure. Analysts expect a 14% decline in earnings this year despite a near-10% gain in revenue. Next year, the top and bottom line are forecast to improve, growing 7% and 25%, respectively.Here’s the thing, though. Nike is in its last quarter of the fiscal year. Meaning that 14% earnings dip for the year is coming to an end, setting the stage for a strong fiscal year rebound in the coming quarters.Target (TGT)an image of bullseye the target dog in a target store. retail stocks to buySource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comLast but not least, we have Target (NYSE:TGT). Shares fell 46.7% from the August 2021 high to the June 2022 low. Despite a mild rally and a decent couple of trading days lately, the stock still remains 35% below the all-time high.While retail may not be experiencing the best environment right now, Target is one of the premiere names in the space. Like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and others, Target retail stock shows promise as it has built out a strong omni-channel presence, allowing it to leverage a digital and physical footprint while benefiting from the logistics that were already in place.Not to mention, the company has raised its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years. Despite periods of high inflation and deep recessions, this company’s dividend continues to chug along. Now yielding about 2.6%, it’s worth paying attention, particularly as this name should eventually return to all-time highs, making it one of the top retail stocks to buy.It won’t, but just for argument’s sake, say Target stock hit new highs before its next dividend increase (likely in June). It would yield just 1.6%.Interestingly, estimates call for robust earnings growth and strong revenue growth in 2024. If that comes to fruition, bulls should be pleased.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

ISRG is scheduled to release first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 18, after the closing bell.The stock has gained 0.4% so far this year compared with the industry’s 2.2% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 7% in the same time frame.In the last reported quarter, ISRG delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.38%. Its earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, the average surprise being 2.42%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ1 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ISRG’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.58 billion, indicating a 6.5% improvement from the year-ago period. The consensus mark for earnings is $1.18 per share, indicating a 4.4% increase from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteThe Instruments &amp; Accessories segment is likely to have witnessed a strong first quarter on the back of growing da Vinci procedure volume in the past two quarters. However, unfavorable currency movements and a resurgence in COVID-19 infections are expected to have partially offset gains from recovering demand in procedures. These effects are likely to be reflected in the first-quarter results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Instruments &amp; Accessories revenues is $891 million, indicating a 10% increase year over year.Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci capital placements are likely to have been on the lower side due to lesser trade-in of systems (majority of U.S. customers have upgraded to newer generation systems). The potential downside can also be attributed to continued supply chain challenges impacting availability of semiconductor components and growing capital spending pressure on hospitals amid rising inflationary pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the da Vinci systemin the United States is pegged at 146 units.However, Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci capital placements are likely to have benefited from rising demand outside the United States. The company placed 188 systems in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with 150 in the prior-year quarter in ex-U.S. markets. The trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesISRG expects the single port platform’s growth to be driven by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the United States and Korea. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the sales of the da Vinci system outside the United States is 134 units, indicating a 7.2% year-over-year growth.During the fourth quarter, Intuitive Surgical’s digital product, Intuitive Hub, exhibited a year-over-year increase. The company is in discussions with the FDA on how to best characterize some of its core artificial intelligence technology. It will continue to bring its flexible endoscopy platform, Ion, to scale and boost its capacity, quality and cost improvementswhile seeking to expand access to new markets. These developments might have contributed to the company’s first-quarter 2023 performance.Intuitive Surgical’s new platforms made advancements in terms of commercialization, innovation and clinical programs. This trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well.However, higher logistics costs amid supply-chain challenges and rising inflationary pressure are likely to have increased expenses, thereby hurting margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

RCL is likely to benefit from digital initiatives, strong close-in bookings and other ship upgrades. This and the increased focus on Trifecta Program bode well. However, inflationary and supply chain challenges raise concerns.Factors Driving GrowthShares of Royal Caribbean have surged 37.2% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 19.2% growth. The company has been benefitting from strong demand for its brands’ vacation experiences, strong close-in bookings (at higher prices) and continued strength of onboard revenue.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported early consumer engagement, with about 60% purchasing onboard experiences before the sailings. This represents double-digit growth in penetration and much higher revenue (related to pre-cruise purchases) from 2019 levels. The company emphasizes enhancing its e-commerce and pre-cruise capabilities and optimizing its distribution channels to boost guest repeat rates and spending.Royal Caribbean continues using digital tools for marketing, product development and enhancing the consumer experience. The initiative is vital in enhancing customer preference, engagement, cruise frequency, guest experience and spending. The company has introduced new technological capabilities under its Project Excalibur. It has also rolled out a smartphone app to increase convenience and better serve guests. Streaming WiFi, expanded onboard offerings, customized destination experiences and other ship upgrades are also paying off.On the supply front, the company is steadfast in increasing its capacity to meet rising demand. Moving into 2023, the company has three ships scheduled for delivery — Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova. The company anticipates the additions to boost its capacity by approximately 14% from 2019 levels. The company anticipates the ship to be significantly accretive to its key financial metrics.Meanwhile, the company emphasizes on Trifecta program to drive growth. The program emphasizes financial coordinates, including Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC, intending to achieve it by 2025-end.Under this program, the company expects a triple-digit adjusted EBITDA per APCD, exceeding the earlier record adjusted EBITDA per APCD of $87 in 2019. The company also expects to achieve double-digit adjusted earnings per share, exceeding the earlier adjusted earnings per share of $9.54 in 2019. Lastly, the company anticipates achieving a return on invested capital in the teens by the end of 2025. The company intends to achieve the metrics on account of its underlying strategies, robust secular and demographic trends, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline.Story continuesConcernsThe leisure industry is grappling with the coronavirus crisis and Royal Caribbean isn’t immune to the trend. China, which is closed to international travelers, will continue to hurt cruise operators. Also, it stated that the impacts of COVID-19 (on the shipyards), Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and other macroeconomic events have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries.Royal Caribbean has been bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time. During the fourth quarter of 2022, total cruise operating expenses increased 57% year over year to $1,782.4 million. The company’s expenses in the quarter primarily stemmed from the resumption of cruise voyages. This and inflationary increases related to fuel and food costs added to the downside. For 2023, the company expects net cruise costs, (excluding fuel per APCD) to increase 4.8-5.8% from 2019 levels. The company anticipates inflationary and supply chain challenges (mainly related to fuel and food costs) to persist for some time.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksRoyal Caribbean has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Cedar Fair, L.P. FUN, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. HGV and Crocs, Inc. CROX.Cedar Fair sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 64.5%, on average.

It is ideal for use in Internet of Things (IoT) endpoints.The company recently collaborated with The Things Industries for IoT solutions, which will combine LoRaWAN and cellular solutions.These solutions are well-equipped to make end-to-end connectivity integration easier, which will accelerate IoT deployments.We note that expanding portfolio strength is expected to aid the company’s performance across the various end markets.However, weak demand environments across the end markets are a major concern.

192,983fcead-531a-3d2d-8c0a-fd5f303c7fa6,RF,2023-04-15,Regions Financial (RF) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financial-rf-earnings-expected-140002501.html,1681480802,STORY,"['RF', 'SNV']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Regions Financial (RF) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis holding company for Regions Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.96 billion, up 22.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.15% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regions Financial?For Regions Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Regions Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Regions Financial would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.67, delivering a surprise of +3.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Regions Financial doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, Synovus Financial (SNV), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $595.87 million, up 19.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Synovus has been revised 6.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.90%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Synovus will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Visa (V) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to V for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Visa's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Visa's main business drivers.Incorporated in 2007 as a Delaware stock corporation and headquartered in San Francisco, CA, Visa Inc. operates as a payments technology company all over the world. The company went public in March 2008 via an initial public offering (IPO). It was founded in 1958. The company has evolved and grown over the course of the last six decades:It provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to financial institutions and merchant clients through VisaNet, its global processing platform. It offers a wide range of Visa-branded payment products, which its financial institution clients would develop and offer core business solutions, credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for account holders (individuals, businesses and government entities).Visa provides other value-added services to its clients including fraud and risk management, debit issuer processing, loyalty services, dispute management, digital services like tokenization as well as consulting and analytics. It manages and promotes its brands to the benefit of its clients and partners through advertising, promotional and sponsorship initiatives with the Olympic Games, FIFA and the National Football League among others.In recent years, the company has evolved its organization to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels including e-commerce, mobile and wearables.

202,c76f6816-178b-36cf-8c96-40ffe60b0680,NVDA,2023-04-15,Investors Heavily Search NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-nvidia-corporation-130001192.html,1681477201,STORY,['NVDA'],"[Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +3.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 13.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +34.7%. This estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.98 indicates a change of +32.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.5 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.6%. The $29.68 billion and $37.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10% and +25%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $6.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.8%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $1.32 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +8.64%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While stocks can experience long streaks of price appreciation, corrections are a natural part of the market cycle. As the old saying goes, ""Without pain, how could we know joy?""Correcting through Price Versus TimeA correction through price tends to be a dramatic and sudden drop more times than not. The suddenness and velocity can lead to a domino effect, where falling prices cause more selling in what ultimately becomes a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" of sorts. In early 2022, this phenomenon gave way to a correction through both price and time.Conversely, when the stock market corrects through time, it usually means that the price is relatively stable, but the market experiences a brief period of consolidation or sideways price movement. During this time, investors may become hesitant and uncertain, leading to a dry-up in volume and a sideways price chop. Though a correction through time frustrates investors, it can be an essential building block for higher prices later.Corrections through time are evidence of a more robust market. 2022 was indicative of an equity market that required a large correction or reset. Meanwhile, thus far, the current correction is more a sign of a pause in an uptrend.Navigating PullbacksMarket corrections are a normal part of the investing cycle and can often be short-lived. Regardless of whether a correction occurs through time or price, investors need to remain calm and avoid making impulsive, emotional decisions. Below are 3 tips on how to navigate a market correction:Story continuesAsk yourself, ""What stocks are holding up best?"": Relative strength is the most effective yet simple indicator at an investor's disposal during a correction. Think of a strong relative strength stock as a beach ball being held underwater. You can only hold the ball down for so long before it springboards back to the surface. Semiconductor leader Rambus was a prime example of relative strength in September 2022. In the yellow box on the chart below, notice how RMBS was hitting new highs while the S&amp;P 500 Index was weak and retesting lows. Because 3-4 stocks tend to follow the market direction and RMBS didn't, the action was noteworthy.Follow the Leaders: Leaders, or stocks that have been moving up the most in an uptrend are called leaders for a reason – they lead. Presently, tech, specifically semiconductors, are the leading stocks in the market. Innovative chip maker Nvidia is among the ""cream of the crop"" when it comes to true market leaders.As such, regardless of whether or not you caught this year's breathtaking move in the stock, it bears watching. NVDA is pulling into trendline support and the 21-day moving average for the first time in 2023. If it can hold this zone, the correction may be short-lived. If the stock breaks this zone, the correction likely has longer to go.Other leading stocks to watch for more evidence include mega-cap tech stocks such as Microsoft, Apple and Netflix.Know your timeframe: Before a correction occurs, and before you decide to invest in the stock market, for that matter, you should be acutely aware of what you're willing to risk and your time frame. In this case, there is no right or wrong answer. However, your time frame should lead you to how you handle corrections. For example, a long-term investor should be able to take a 5-10% correction in the S&amp;P 500 Index in stride. On the other hand, swing traders may need to stop themselves out of some positions in that case and readjust their portfolio. Either way, investors should prepare and have a clear-cut strategy ahead of time.ConclusionPrice pullbacks are often thought of in a negative light by investors. However, as we explained above, they are a necessary ingredient for the market and can help lead the way for the next market move higher. To succeed, investors should stay calm, informed, and enter corrections with a clear action plan.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.21%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.42%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.64%.Heading into today, shares of the prescription drug distributor had gained 7.18% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's gain of 7.66% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.71% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from McKesson as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be May 8, 2023. In that report, analysts expect McKesson to post earnings of $7.13 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 22.3%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $67.93 billion, up 2.77% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for McKesson should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

McKesson is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Investors should also note McKesson's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 13.85. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.52.Also, we should mention that MCK has a PEG ratio of 1.34.

ISRG is scheduled to release first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 18, after the closing bell.The stock has gained 0.4% so far this year compared with the industry’s 2.2% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 7% in the same time frame.In the last reported quarter, ISRG delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.38%. Its earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, the average surprise being 2.42%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ1 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ISRG’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.58 billion, indicating a 6.5% improvement from the year-ago period. The consensus mark for earnings is $1.18 per share, indicating a 4.4% increase from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteThe Instruments &amp; Accessories segment is likely to have witnessed a strong first quarter on the back of growing da Vinci procedure volume in the past two quarters. However, unfavorable currency movements and a resurgence in COVID-19 infections are expected to have partially offset gains from recovering demand in procedures. These effects are likely to be reflected in the first-quarter results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Instruments &amp; Accessories revenues is $891 million, indicating a 10% increase year over year.Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci capital placements are likely to have been on the lower side due to lesser trade-in of systems (majority of U.S. customers have upgraded to newer generation systems). The potential downside can also be attributed to continued supply chain challenges impacting availability of semiconductor components and growing capital spending pressure on hospitals amid rising inflationary pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the da Vinci systemin the United States is pegged at 146 units.However, Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci capital placements are likely to have benefited from rising demand outside the United States. The company placed 188 systems in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with 150 in the prior-year quarter in ex-U.S. markets. The trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesISRG expects the single port platform’s growth to be driven by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the United States and Korea. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the sales of the da Vinci system outside the United States is 134 units, indicating a 7.2% year-over-year growth.During the fourth quarter, Intuitive Surgical’s digital product, Intuitive Hub, exhibited a year-over-year increase. The company is in discussions with the FDA on how to best characterize some of its core artificial intelligence technology. It will continue to bring its flexible endoscopy platform, Ion, to scale and boost its capacity, quality and cost improvementswhile seeking to expand access to new markets. These developments might have contributed to the company’s first-quarter 2023 performance.Intuitive Surgical’s new platforms made advancements in terms of commercialization, innovation and clinical programs. This trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well.However, higher logistics costs amid supply-chain challenges and rising inflationary pressure are likely to have increased expenses, thereby hurting margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Fundamentally, these enterprises offer the best of both worlds: capital gains potential on advancing digitalization initiatives and passive income while you wait.Primarily, AI stocks with dividends benefit from the brewing upside potential of the underlying industry. According to Grand View Research, the global AI market reached a valuation of $136.55 billion in 2022. Moreover, experts project that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. At the end of the forecasted period, the segment should generate revenue of $1.81 trillion.However, let’s be honest: startups directly associated with AI development tend to be highly volatile. While they can make you rich, they’re liable to put you in bankruptcy proceedings if you’re not careful. Therefore, AI stocks with dividends present an attractive alternative.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMIBM.$130.42AVGOBroadcom$621.57APDAir Products and Chemicals$285.33IBM (IBM)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comAlthough IBM (NYSE:IBM) stumbled in years past due to its connection to legacy business units, the new “Big Blue” represents a powerhouse among AI stocks with dividends. Notably, the company commands a leadership position in the underlying sector with the machine-learning protocol IBM Watson. From finance to biotechnology to environmental research to even sports, Watson delivers myriad relevancies.Further, IBM is quite generous when it comes to passive income. At the moment, the tech enterprise carries a forward yield of 5.04%. This stat ranks well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the company benefits from 29 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. As well, investors may be attracted by IBM’s value proposition. Currently, the market prices IBM at a forward multiple of 13.7. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 77.53% of the competition.Story continuesTo be fair, Wall Street analysts peg IBM as a consensus hold. However, their upside target is $145, implying nearly 11% upside potential.Broadcom (AVGO)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA designer and manufacturer of various semiconductor and infrastructure software products, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is no stranger to innovation. Unsurprisingly, then, it took a leadership role in automation, making AVGO one of the more compelling AI stocks with dividends. Specifically, Broadcom develops applications that automate IT remediation capabilities, dramatically boosting efficiencies. Since the January opener, AVGO gained over 13% of its equity value.Presently, Broadcom carries a forward yield of 2.94%. While not as generous as IBM, Broadcom handily beats the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, it holds its own regarding consistency with a track record of 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. As well, the company has a low payout ratio of 41.59%, facilitating confidence regarding yield sustainability. Also, AVGO presents solid value. The market prices shares at a forward multiple of 15.11. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 69.85% of its peers.Finally, analysts peg AVGO as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $697.31, which implies over 11% upside potential.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comAs an industrial firm specializing in selling gases and chemicals, Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) doesn’t seem a natural fit for AI stocks with dividends. However, machine learning protocols can enhance efficiencies across multiple sectors. Here, Air Products deploys automation to improve its production line, thereby increasing productivity and minimizing resource consumption.Right now, Air Products carries a forward yield of 2.47%. Admittedly, that’s a bit lower than the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. However, the company owns a serious advantage over its rivals: a track record of 42 years of consecutive dividend increases. After eight more years, it can join the exclusive ranks of dividend kings.Also, the yield should be sustainable considering that Air Products features a highly profitable business. Its trailing-year net margin comes in at 17.61%, beating out 86.76% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg APD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $321.78, implying almost 14% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

209,1462f728-47f5-3fbb-947c-547566144f7b,FOX,2023-04-15,Rupert Murdoch’s own succession saga at risk from his biggest scandal since phone hacking,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-own-succession-saga-120000071.html,1681560000,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch - David Paul Morris/BloombergRupert Murdoch claims never to have watched Succession, despite allegedly putting a clause about the hit TV show in his divorce agreement with Jerry Hall.The fictional saga about the internecine struggles of a powerful US media dynasty is loosely based on the billionaire media mogul.However, the real-life Murdoch appears to have lined up his own succession plans in a more orderly fashion: son Lachlan is already the head of Fox Corporation and ready to take the reins.Now, though, an existential threat has emerged in the form of a multibillion-dollar legal battle.Fox is facing two defamation claims brought by the manufacturers of voting machines, which claim the network knowingly spread lies about the 2020 US election being stolen from Donald Trump.The case, scheduled to begin in the US this week, poses the biggest challenge to Murdoch’s empire since the phone hacking scandal – and threatens to cast a shadow over his legacy.Donald Trump (R) speaks to media mogul Rupert Murdoch - REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File PhotoMurdoch himself is expected to be called as a witness, with the billionaire taking the stand as soon as this week.It will be the first public grilling of the mogul since MPs and the Leveson Inquiry questioned the billionaire over a decade ago.Reputational risk is high. Murdoch is already facing embarrassment after his fifth engagement collapsed after just two weeks, while an explosive Vanity Fair article last week revealed salacious details about his relationship with Jerry Hall and the state of the 92-year-old’s health.“So far, nothing has really gone Rupert’s way,” says Alice Enders at Enders Analysis.“All this is embarrassing. It’s all bad for Rupert’s legacy.”Fox’s legal woes date back to the aftermath of the 2020 US presidential election, when the opinionated news channel was battling to keep hold of viewers loyal to Donald Trump.Trump was pushing the false idea that Joe Biden had won thanks to fraudulent votes.Internal messages from senior Fox executives, made public as part of the trial, show they were fretting Trump supporters would switch to rival right wing networks if the channel did not back the MAGA leader.Story continuesTwo technology companies, Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA, have accused Fox of knowingly airing false claims that their systems were used to rig votes and steal the election.Murdoch admitted in a deposition that some Fox presenters had endorsed the idea of a stolen election on air.Asked if he could have intervened to prevent the false claims from being broadcast, the media baron said: “I could have. But I didn’t.”This apparent awareness is at the heart of the legal challenge launched by Dominion, which argues that Fox knew the claims were false but broadcast them anyway.In a raft of explosive emails and text messages, Murdoch, senior executives and presenters voiced their concerns that the channel was airing false claims peddled by Trump and his team.Murdoch described claims the election was stolen as “really crazy” and “damaging”, adding it was “very hard to credibly claim foul everywhere”.Meanwhile, controversial host Tucker Carlson branded the idea that Dominion had rigged votes “shockingly reckless” and described the former President as a “demonic force”.Raj Shah, a top Fox executive, said the claims were “outlandish” and “mind-blowingly nuts”. One producer on Laura Ingraham’s show wrote: “This dominion s— is going to give me a f—--- aneurysm.”Fox News Murdoch Dominion - Fox BusinessSmartmatic is seeking $2.7bn in damages, while Dominion wants $1.6bn. The trial is due to begin with opening statements on Monday and run for five weeks.To win, the two companies must prove that Fox either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy.In a blow to Fox’s case, the channel has been barred from using the defence that it was merely reporting “newsworthy” claims.In a further setback, the judge has threatened sanctions against the channel over accusations its lawyers withheld critical details about the role Murdoch played at Fox News.Superior court judge Eric Davis said the company’s handling of the case left it with a “credibility problem”.“From what I have seen, Fox could be in some serious trouble,” says one industry source, adding that the broadcaster could be liable to “punitive damages”.Successful claims by Dominion and Smartmatic could open the floodgates to more lawsuits.Ms Enders says Fox’s huge profits mean it can absorb the financial blow. But she adds: “I think the fact that litigation is going to go on and on makes it very difficult to value Fox because it’s got these potential liabilities.”More fundamentally, industry watchers warn the trial could have a damaging impact on Murdoch’s reputation and legacy – just as he looks to hand over the reins.A shareholder suit filed directly against Murdoch and his son Lachlan alleges that their failure to act on “red flags” exposed the company to the defamation suits in the first place, highlighting the risk of personal liability for the family.Lachlan is also expected to take the stand.“The cash by itself is not so much an issue, but it may raise questions about the management decision-making and compliance,” the industry source says.Murdoch has already suffered a shareholder backlash this year, after his attempt to merge Fox and News Corp, the parent company of titles including the Wall Street Journal, Sun and Times, was blocked.The deal was seen as a way of consolidating power as the billionaire gears up for a handover.Many also question Murdoch’s decision not to settle the Dominion case – a strategy previously employed during the phone-hacking scandal.News Corp is still forking out hundreds of millions of pounds to settle those claims, but damaging headlines about the scandal are long gone.Fighting the Dominion and Smartmatic cases in court has already aired Fox’s dirty laundry and threatens to turn up yet more embarrassing details once the trial begins.“It is riveting that Fox lawyers have failed to stop the trial,” says Enders. “I would have thought that someone should have told Rupert many months ago to settle this, even though it may appear to be some form of admission.”As Murdoch prepares to take the stand, the media mogul knows it is not only his finances on the line but his reputation.]"

211,ac8bb46c-e2d2-3df6-a4ce-f3ab06b46c75,FOX,2023-04-15,What's next in the $1.6 billion Dominion defamation suit against Fox?,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-next-1-6-billion-162607038.html,1681489567,STORY,['FOXA'],"[By Jack Queen(Reuters) - Opening statements are set to begin on Monday in Wilmington, Delaware in a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox Corp and Fox News, which is seeking $1.6 billion in damages over the network's coverage of false vote-rigging claims in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.Here is what to expect.OPENING STATEMENTSDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis began choosing members of the jury on Thursday and is due to finish the process on Monday before opening statements to the 12-member panel by lawyers for the two sides commence later that day. The trial promises to shed further light on the inner workings of one of the biggest U.S. cable networks, known for its conservative commentators.Dominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News in 2021, accusing them of ruining its reputation by airing false claims by Republican former President Donald Trump and his lawyers that the Denver-based company's voting machines were used to rig the outcome of the election against him and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.Dominion is seeking to prove that Fox personnel - show producers and hosts all the way up to the top executives - knew that the election claims were false but continued hosting guests who touted them, fearing the loss of viewers to competing right-wing media outlets that embraced the conspiracy theories. Dominion cited troves of internal Fox communications that it said proved the network knowingly spread falsehoods or recklessly disregarded the truth - the legal standard of ""actual malice"" that it must meet to prevail in a defamation case.Fox has argued that Dominion cherry-picked evidence to mischaracterize the network's coverage decisions, which it said were reasonable because election-rigging claims by the president's lawyers were inherently newsworthy. Fox has said it also gave Dominion's side of the story by airing its denials.WILL RUPERT MURDOCH TESTIFY?Yes. The Fox Corp chairman is set to take the witness stand, along with other executives including Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott. The trial is also due to include testimony from a parade of conservative-leaning Fox hosts including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro. The trial is expected to last five to six weeks.Story continuesCOULD THE TWO SIDES STILL SETTLE?Possibly, but experts think that is unlikely because the two sides have litigated the case fiercely for two years and framed it as more than a simple business dispute that could likely be resolved by a settlement.Dominion has argued that Fox's conduct was damaging to American democracy and that the network must be held accountable for crossing the line between journalism and the heedless pursuit of ratings. Fox has called Dominion's lawsuit an assault on the free press and framed its stance in the case as a defense of journalism and diversity of ideas in the public square.WHAT ABOUT DAMAGES?Fox has attacked the credibility of Dominion's damages estimate, saying it is based upon unrealistic growth projections and faulty assumptions. The network has said Dominion was worth only $80 million in 2018 and has continued to grow and post strong revenues despite the untrue claims of election-rigging.Dominion has defended its damages model, which it has said was based on industry standard accounting methods. An expert report commissioned by the company attributed scores of lost contracts to Fox's coverage, though much of the report remains under seal. More of those details are likely to come out when Dominion's expert testifies.(Reporting by Jack Queen; Editing by Will Dunham and Noeleen Walder)]"

Ron DeSantis about Disney World: ‘I do not view this as a going-to-mattresses situation’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bob-iger-says-willing-meet-174048346.html,1681494048,STORY,['DIS'],"[Disney and Florida governor Ron DeSantis have a beef. The governor and Disney World have been in a battle ever since Disney’s previous CEO, Bob Chapek, spoke out last year against the state’s so-called Don’t Say Gay law, which bans instructions about sexual orientation and gender identity at some elementary school classes. For a while it looked like DeSantis was winning when he seized control of Disney World’s special district, but in a stealth move, the company managed to stay independent by slipping in a clause at the last minute. Since then, the governor has vowed to “void anything Disney did on the way out the door.” And Iger called DeSantis’ retaliation as “anti-business” and “anti-Florida” earlier this month.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home But Disney’s returning CEO, Bob Iger, said he’s open to having talks with DeSantis, as the state of Florida is important to the company.“I do not view this as a going-to-mattresses situation for us,” Igor said in an interview with Time published Thursday, using a phrase popularized by The Godfather that means going to war. Iger added that he would be willing to have a sit-down with DeSantis: “If the governor of Florida wants to meet with me to discuss all of this, of course, I would be glad to do that.”The 72-year-old CEO added that he has always respected elected officials and this case is no different.Disney and Gov. DeSantis have sparred for months over the company’s self-governing district which gave it a special tax status and other benefits regarding new construction and medical services. The arrangement, which has been in place since 1967, saved the company millions of dollars over the years.Although tension has been brewing for a year now, Florida and Disney are deeply intertwined. Iger took care to highlight how Disney World has 75,000 employees, and welcomes millions of tourists in its theme parks near Orlando every year.Story continues“Our sole goal in Florida is to continue creating that value for all those constituencies. All we want is a relationship with the state that enables us to continue to do that,” Iger said. “We have the wherewithal and we have the desire to continue to invest there to grow that business so that we can hire more people so that we can increase our attendance, and so that we can basically increase more value for the Walt Disney Company and for the state of Florida. It’s that simple.”Disney and representatives of DeSantis did not immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.The Disney-DeSantis tussleThe feud between Disney and DeSantis began about a year ago. DeSantis signed the Don’t Say Gay bill last March, which is being considered in a number of other states like Texas, Arizona, and Alabama. Disney, led by Chapek at the time, kept its silence on the bill and was met with backlash from employees and fans, some of whom belonged to the LGBTQ+ community. Days later, Chapek issued an apology and ultimately opposed the bill—Iger did too—a move that didn’t bode well with DeSantis, who called the company “Woke Disney.”The Republican governor decided to revoke the special tax status that Disney had enjoyed for decades. There was just one hiccup—if Disney was stripped of its self-governing status, residents in Florida’s Orange County and Osceola regions would have to share the financial burden of some services offered in Disney World, like fire services and policing, and its $1 billion debt bill. So DeSantis left the district’s financial and debt aspect untouched and instead took control by appointing five board members to make decisions for Disney World instead of the company itself.“Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,” DeSantis said in February when the bill to remove Disney’s special status was signed. “There’s a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day.”But Disney pulled a fast one. The former board that controlled the Disney district gave its power back to the entertainment company by creating a very unusual development agreement for its outgoing board that stripped the new governor-appointed board of much of its power until the death of the “last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, King of England.”DeSantis is not the only problem Disney is grappling with. Since Iger returned as the company’s CEO last November, the company had to face pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz. In February, the company announced it would lay off 7,000 workers in three batches to reduce costs by $5.5 billion. Peltz dropped his proxy war with Disney after Iger announced steps to restructure the company and bring costs down, calling it a “win for all shareholders.”Last month, top Marvel Entertainment executive Isaac “Ike” Perlmutter, who backed Peltz in his fight for a board seat at Disney, was sacked from the company. Iger said that was a business decision made to improve how Marvel was being managed, and said it wasn’t done because of his support for Peltz.“This decision would have been made regardless of that,” Iger told Time about Perlmutter’s firing. “This was a necessary step in the direction of us creating a more efficient company.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home In an interview with Time published on Thursday, Disney’s returning CEO claimed turfing out Perlmutter from a company he had once owned should not be misconstrued as payback for mounting a boardroom challenge via an affiliated activist investor Nelson Peltz.“This decision would have been made regardless of that,” Iger said during a cover shoot for the magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2023.The frugal billionaire Perlmutter—who had been sidelined from creative decisions ever since Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige emerged victorious from their bitter power struggle eight years ago—played a key role in encouraging the Trian Fund Management CEO Peltz to buy $1 billion in Disney stock and campaign for a seat on the board.Peltz has since dropped his quest after Iger announced cost cuts of $5.5 billion to stop the bleeding at its loss-making streaming business Disney+ as well as layoffs affecting 7,000 employees.Perlmutter is not the only high-profile victim of the cuts—Feige lost one of his two chief lieutenants as well—but he was likely the biggest surprise.“This was a necessary step in the direction of us creating a more efficient company. There was redundancy specific to the way Marvel was being managed,” Iger said, declining to comment further on the controversial move.The Disney CEO’s comments are surprising given Perlmutter was notorious for being obsessed with efficiency. Indeed the billionaire said this month he was fired for complaining about just how costly Marvel movies had become.Story continuesRetreading old ground with live-action remakesDisney’s stock may have rebounded 13% since January, but the company appears to be firmly stuck in a creative rut, in particular when it comes to its animated offerings.Lightyear, a loose spinoff of the character from Pixar’s Toy Story, disappointed last year, while Strange World proved an outright bomb.

It utilizes the following key features to inform every stage of data-enabled linear, streaming and/or cross-platform TV campaign media planning, thereby driving efficiency and effectiveness:Planning: This new solution allows marketers to create more precise audience segments. Advertisers can target audiences based on specific viewing habits across screens (spanning genres, programs and/or movies) or by brand ad exposure (i.e., the target audiences’ engagement to previous brand or competitor ads). Additionally, advertisers can prioritize networks and dayparts based on overall reach and audience segment concentration.Mid-Campaign Optimization: AudienceXpress planners gain instant insights, allowing swift campaign optimization to ensure optimal frequency and strong delivery against key performance indicators.Post-Campaign Measurement: This new solution also provides in-depth insights on the entire campaign’s actual reach, impressions, frequency and performance against full-funnel business goals.This new offering draws its data-driven insights from Comcast’s aggregated viewership and ad exposure data spanning ~15 million U.S. households.* Additionally, a ""bring your own data"" option allows marketers to ingest their own first-party data or licensed third-party data alongside the available Comcast insights.Story continues""In developing this new solution, we listened to what advertisers are telling us and the result is an offering that addresses their needs. Heading into the 2023 upfronts, brands are looking for scale, high-quality premium inventory and real-time, data-driven insights so that they can improve the user experience and accurately deliver on business goals. We aimed to solve for all of these needs with this new solution and look forward to what it can do for the industry,"" said AudienceXpress Chief Revenue Officer Katy Loria.The introduction of this new solution is timely for a few reasons. Per an Advertiser Perceptions survey conducted jointly with FreeWheel (another Comcast Advertising-owned brand), the majority of marketers and agencies polled saw ""increasing brand awareness"" as a top benefit of TV advertising. One of the primary barriers to them spending more on this medium, however, was ""high costs"" (50%). More than half of respondents (56%) noted that better measurement, attribution and/or optimization capabilities were among the biggest drivers when considering an increase in TV ad spend. (This new solution aims to address that last pain point through a combination of education, awareness and capabilities that better link and prove cross-platform TV’s value.)*Comcast’s aggregated viewership and ad exposure data spans ~15 million U.S. households, scaled to the full national footprint of all 210 designated market areas (DMAs). Additionally, the data source also includes Experian’s 100+ audience segments (spanning demographics, behavioral, purchase interests, etc.)AudienceXpressAudienceXpress is a Comcast company that provides market-leading media solutions that allow advertisers to buy premium TV advertising – across all screens – on an audience basis. In today’s dynamic and evolving media marketplace, AudienceXpress provides direct, easy and scaled access to the premium TV audiences that matter, including across broadcast, cable, digital and connected TV.

Meet our Chief Financial Officer, Tiffany Furman.HBG: How do you achieve a work-life balance?TF: I'd say prioritizing and having a really strong team leads to having more time for your personal life. You can't do everything, so it's helpful to pick and choose what will make the most impact. The key is to make sure you communicate to ensure the right people are aware and aligned with what you're focusing on and what you're putting further down the list. Also, taking the time to build the team's capability or hire the right person makes everyone's lives better. I've had some very high performing teams and it's amazing what they can accomplish quickly and efficiently. Lastly, I have an extremely supportive husband and we take turns taking on more life responsibilities when the other is busier.HBG: Who Was Your Favorite Female Figure?TF: Growing up, I was inspired by Cheryl Miller. Being from Indiana, I remember thinking it was so cool that Reggie Miller had an older sister that he self-admittedly would say could beat him at basketball. In addition to being a great player, she also thrived as a sports reporter and coach. It's such an achievement for her time considering the popularity of women sports, which is still lacking today.HBG: How Can we Support &amp; Empower Other Women?TF: Throughout my own career, I've been fortunate to work with many amazing female leaders.

A growing purchase volume, resulting from increased contributions from its five sales platforms, also contributed to the upside. However, the quarterly results were partly offset by rising benchmark rates, elevated expenses and reduced average active accounts.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the first-quarter earnings announcement.What Do Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share of $1.50 suggests a 13.3% decrease from the prior-year reported figure of $1.73, while our estimate stands at $1.36. The consensus mark declined by a penny over the past week. The consensus estimate for first-quarter revenues of $4 billion indicates a 5.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure, while our estimate suggests 2.5% year-over-year growth.Synchrony beat the consensus estimate for earnings in all the prior four quarters, the average being 10.3%. This is depicted in the graph below:Synchrony Financial Price and EPS Surprise Synchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial price-eps-surprise | Synchrony Financial QuoteFactors to NoteSynchrony is expected to have benefited from higher purchase volume in the first quarter as consumer spending remained resilient to economic volatilities. Our estimate for total purchase volumes for the quarter under review indicates a year-over-year improvement of 9.8%. Moreover, we expect interest and fees on loans to have increased 10% year over year in the first quarter, boosting the top line.SYF is expected to have consistently gained from digital sales volume in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate suggest that the average active accounts in the Home &amp; Auto platform have risen 5.5% year over year in the first quarter.Story continuesThe financial service provider is expected to have witnessed an increase in Average Interest-Earnings Assets. The consensus estimate indicates a 9% increase in the metric from the year-ago period, while our estimate suggests a 4.6% jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the efficiency ratio is pegged at 35.43%, suggesting a decline from the prior-year reported figure of 37.20%.While the above-mentioned factors are likely to have benefited the company in the first quarter, some elements are anticipated to have offset the positives, leading to an earnings miss and a year-over-year decline. The company is expected to have incurred increased employee costs, information processing, and marketing and business development expenses in the first quarter.Our estimate for total non-interest expenses for the quarter indicates 8.5% year-over-year growth. Increased expenses are expected to have reduced the margins in the quarter under review.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the net interest margin is pegged at 15.4%, down from 15.8% a year ago, while our estimate suggests a net interest margin of 15.5%. The net charge-offs are likely to have significantly increased in the quarter in review.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Synchrony this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -4.70%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate stands at $1.43 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Synchrony currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Synchrony, here are some companies from the broader finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Owl Rock Capital Corporation ORCC has an Earnings ESP of +0.47% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Owl Rock Capital’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 43 cents per share, implying a 38.7% jump from the year-ago reported figure.

MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com3M Corporation (NYSE:MMM) is one of the most diversified companies in the world with operating segments in five diverse businesses. Although the brand has been the subject of lawsuits and controversy recently, its wide array of patents and inventions give it an advantage which may be unmatched by its peers.The sheer number of patents and other intellectual property rights means it has a strong moat, combined with an instantly recognizable brand in various industries. It’s then no wonder why it’s often a top pick for investors looking to park their money into the industrials sector.The company’s dividend yield is also very solid at 5.84% at the time of writing. This combined, with a healthy payout ratio of 59.11% and a 1.14% annualized dividend growth means it could be a fit for many portfolios. Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comThere are some good reasons to be bullish on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) right now if one is seeking shelter through a strong economic moat. The first is its investment into OpenAI, the business responsible for launching ChatGPT. Microsoft’s investment has already started to pay off, as millions of new users have signed up to try out Bing Chat, and possibly challenge Google’s dominance in the search engine space. Story continuesAside from benefiting from an emerging renaissance for Bing, Microsoft’s moat comes from its integrated ecosystem of connected products such as Windows, Microsoft teams, Skype, Azure and others. Microsoft is also working to improve the synergy between these products to keep its customers within arms reach, leading to up and cross-selling opportunities.Another good reason to buy Microsoft is that it’s emerging as a dividend aristocrat, with over 20 years of dividend payment increases. Although its yield is a lackluster 0.94%, it invests heavily into its future growth and has a very sustainable payout ratio of just 30.22%.McDonald’s (MCD) A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comStudies have put McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) at the top of the list for having the most recognizable brand in the world. The consistent service its customers receive anywhere in the world and famous golden arches means its competitors need to play catch up to match its strength and brand recognition. This is especially an advantage when entering into new and emerging markets outside of the United States where other fast food brands are less known.The market has been feeling very bullish about the brand’s prospects recently, as its shares now command a premium of nearly $290 apiece with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.99. Still, McDonald’s is a dividend aristocrat with a whopping 46 years of consistent dividend increases. Investors might also find safety in knowing that McDonald’s business model works in both good times and bad, meaning that dividend record is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. No McDonald’s CEO wants to be responsible for ending nearly 50 years of consecutive increases.Its yield is a reasonable at 2.14%, and with a hefty stock price comes with an annual dividend of $6.08.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

OK, so I'm just going to put my cards on the table. I'm being very transparent about this. I have been very critical of Express, some of the SKUs, some of the clothing items that they've had. I love this deal. Why? Because I love Bonobos.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I have to give our head of news, Myles Udland, a shoutout. I never heard of Bonobos--BRAD SMITH: What!BRIAN SOZZI: --up until a couple of years ago.BRAD SMITH: All right.BRIAN SOZZI: Myles has this absolutely phenomenal blue suit, very slim-fitting. He looks absolutely awesome in it.BRAD SMITH: They make great suits.BRIAN SOZZI: And he told me, this is Bonobos. And ever since he did, I went out and I stocked up on a whole wardrobe of Bonobos clothing. It is high quality. And the fact this newly formed company came out here and they able to buy this brand for only, what, $75 million off of Walmart that never really figured out what they wanted to do with it, it was never truly integrated into the company, this might be a steal of a deal for this. And this is the first acquisition by this newly combined company.BRAD SMITH: $75 million, right, for the deal? You know what Walmart paid for it? $310 million.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: And that was back in 2017. And it's remarkable that Walmart wasn't really able to capitalize on-- and it perhaps could have been a misread of what the strategy should have been going forward from them for Bonobos. I've seen only-- for a long period of time, they had a lot of the kind of showroom-type of store capacities, where you walk in, you get fitted, you try things on, and then they'll just ship it to you.Story continuesAnd they've got a great shipping and logistics, get it to you in two days type of ability for Bonobos. But I don't know that Walmart was able to make sure that, outside of logistics, was able to really capitalize on how well Bonobos could have done. And perhaps, Express will be able to give them kind of that next leg up.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, this was part of a brand or apparel acquisition spree by Walmart a couple of years ago. They have now unwound that. And I like seeing Walmart do this. Even though they are taking that sizable loss on the deal, this is-- continues to show that Walmart is a more focused company, reinvesting in themselves and what they do best.I like their recent investor day. They came out here, they stood up a new all highly automated factory. And I think they'll open more those-- more of those over the next couple of years as they try to get packages to people faster. They've put more items on their marketplace. Their online sales are surging. They're taking the fight back to Amazon. I like the fact they did this.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, absolutely.]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials How Fast Is Martin Marietta Materials Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Martin Marietta Materials grew its EPS by 12% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Martin Marietta Materials remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$5.7b. That's encouraging news for the company!You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Martin Marietta Materials' future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Martin Marietta Materials Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Martin Marietta Materials has a market capitalisation of US$22b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$143m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.7% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Should You Add Martin Marietta Materials To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Martin Marietta Materials is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists.

Higher volumes transported its pipeline systems are likely to have boosted the company’s profit levels in the first quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from KMI’s Natural Gas Pipelines segment for the first quarter is pegged at $3,542 million, suggesting an improvement from $3,356 million in the prior-year reported quarter.

MDLZ has been focused on its core chocolate and biscuit categories, which has been working well for the company. To this end, Mondelez has undertaken several acquisitions that are yielding positively. These upsides and strength in emerging markets have been aiding the company amid elevated costs and margin concerns.Let’s delve deeper.Mondelez Looks Well-PlacedAs consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, Mondelez’s core categories have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.The company’s core chocolate and biscuit categories remain sustainable in both developed and emerging markets. Both these categories registered double-digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. Management is focused on expanding the categories as these have considerable scope for growth (in terms of penetration and per capita consumption). MDLZ intends to generate around 90% of its revenues through these two core categories in the long run.Mondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Mondelez International, Inc. QuoteMondelez has undertaken several acquisitions to strengthen its snacking portfolio. In its third-quarter 2022 earnings release, the company noted that it closed the Ricolino buyout, which is expected to double the size of its Mexico business. In August 2022, it closed the buyout of Clif Bar.Further, Mondelez acquired the Chipita S.A. business in January 2022, which is a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from the Ricolino, Clif Bar and Chipita buyouts boosted net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022.Moreover, Mondelez announced the sale of its developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle in the fourth quarter. This move will help fund its recent buyouts and streamline its portfolio. Also, it intends to sell the Halls business in the near future. These actions underscore the company’s intention to focus on areas with greater potential.Moving on, MDLZ remains encouraged about the underlying emerging market strength. In the fourth quarter of 2022, revenues from emerging markets increased 23.3% to $3,320 million while rising 24.7% on an organic basis. The company is particularly witnessing strength in China and India. Also, Mondelez saw notable strength in Brazil, China, India, Russia, Mexico, the Western Andean countries and Southeast Asia.Story continuesDownsidesMondelez has been battling cost inflation for a while now. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the adjusted gross profit margin contracted by 120 basis points (bps) to 36% due to increased raw material and transportation costs and an adverse mix. Also, the adjusted operating income margin contracted by 30 bps to 15% due to inflated input costs and an adverse mix.MDLZ is battling challenges related to global cost inflation, the energy crisis, recession-related worries in Europe and supply-chain uncertainty. In its fourth-quarter earnings release, Mondelez stated that it expects another year of double-digit inflation stemming from the continued elevated cost of packaging, energy, ingredients and labor.For the first quarter of 2023, the company anticipates lower margins due to lower volumes in Europe. The European region is expected to remain drab in the second quarter as well. Apart from these factors, Mondelez expects higher interest expenses and pension costs in 2023.Wrapping UpThe resilience of its snacking products, solid brands, strength in emerging markets and gains from the recent acquisitions are likely to help Mondelez add new leaves to its growth story.  For 2023, it expects organic net revenues of 5-7%. MDLZ envisions a high-single-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share or EPS at constant currency.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 22.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 9.3%.Solid Consumer Staple PicksSome better-ranked consumer staple stocks are Lamb Weston LW, General Mills GIS and Conagra Brands CAG.Lamb Weston, which operates as a frozen potato product company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes already launched and cancer drug Jaypirca already approved.Mounjaro is off to a solid start. However, the CRL for donanemab and mirikizumab will probably delay potential launch of the candidates by several months.Generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drug, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are a few top-line headwinds.

But this kind of improvement defeats the purpose of diversity and inclusion.Fortunately, the passing of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, which went into effect in late 2015, paved the way for crowdfunding, allowing anyone — not just the wealthy — to invest in startups. With crowdfunding, women and minority entrepreneurs now have access to the capital they need to get their businesses off the ground.Don’t Miss: The House-Printing Robot Shaking Up a $7.28 Trillion IndustryThe impact of this shift could be enormous, particularly for minority communities that have long been excluded from traditional funding sources. Equity crowdfunding platforms like StartEngine and Republic report underrepresented founders are taking advantage of this new avenue for raising capital. In fact, 27% of offerings on StartEngine had a female founder or co-founder, and 33% had a minority founder. On Republic, 25% of founders who raised funds were from underrepresented minorities, and an impressive 44% of all funds raised in 2017 went to female founders.Equity crowdfunding may still be in its early stages, but its impact could be far-reaching. The fact remains that good ideas are universal, but opportunity is not. It's a frustrating reality for entrepreneurs who don't fit the mold, but there are people in the industry working to change it.Story continuesIn an effort to promote supplier diversity and support underrepresented groups, The Coca-Cola Co. has partnered with Rise Up Crowdfunding LLC to launch a new equity crowdfunding portal. Rise Up Crowdfunding empowers investors from the general public to invest in women and minority-owned small companies and startups looking to raise capital.

252,a41a2f65-484f-33c4-ade6-ccecb5c7f0c2,KO,2023-04-15,Is Most-Watched Stock CocaCola Company (The) (KO) Worth Betting on Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-cocacola-company-130001146.html,1681477201,STORY,"['KO', '^GSPC']","[Coca-Cola (KO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has gained 7.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.65 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.60 points to a change of +4.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.79 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.86 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $44.84 billion and $47.1 billion estimates indicate +4.3% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.13 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7%. EPS of $0.45 for the same period compares with $0.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.2%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Waste Management (NYSE:WM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Waste Management with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Waste Management How Fast Is Waste Management Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Waste Management managed to grow EPS by 12% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. EBIT margins for Waste Management remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 9.9% to US$20b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Waste Management's future profits.Story continuesAre Waste Management Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Waste Management has a market capitalisation of US$67b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$132m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Should You Add Waste Management To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Waste Management is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. Still, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Waste Management.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Both Haemonetics and Stryker have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.HAE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 25.99, while SYK has a forward P/E of 29.10. We also note that HAE has a PEG ratio of 2.60. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. SYK currently has a PEG ratio of 2.99.Another notable valuation metric for HAE is its P/B ratio of 5.58. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, SYK has a P/B of 6.64.Based on these metrics and many more, HAE holds a Value grade of B, while SYK has a Value grade of C.Story continuesBoth HAE and SYK are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that HAE is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Year to date, the stock has gained 7.9% compared with the industry’s increase of 0.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBusiness TailwindsCincinnati Financial is well-poised to grow on the back of solid performance across the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments. Performance of the Personal Lines segment is likely to be driven by the planned expansion of high-net-worth business produced by the agencies, higher renewal written premiums and the extended use of pricing precision tools.The Commercial Lines business is expected to gain from higher earned premiums, renewal written premiums driven by price increases, growth initiatives and a higher level of insured exposures. This segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range.Investment income should continue to rise because of the surge in equity portfolio dividends and increase in interest income from fixed-maturity securities. Moreover, cash flow from operating activities consistently helps the company boost investment income. From 2016 to 2022, the P&amp;C insurer saw its net investment income grow 3.96%.Cincinnati Financial has a solid balance sheet with high liquidity and low leverage. Cash flow, a contributor to investment income and interest income, remains strong.Cincinnati Financial has returned capital to shareholders through regular cash dividends as well as special dividends. In January 2023, the board increased quarterly cash dividend by 9% and this action sets the stage for a 63rd consecutive year of rising dividend payments.

(NASDAQ:GEHC) most popular amongst individual investors who own 56% of the shares, institutions hold 24%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ge-healthcare-technologies-inc-nasdaq-120028798.html,1681560028,STORY,"['GEHC', 'GE']","[Key InsightsThe considerable ownership by individual investors in GE HealthCare Technologies indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategyThe top 25 shareholders own 43% of the company Insiders have been selling lately To get a sense of who is truly in control of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 56% to be precise, is individual investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Meanwhile, institutions make up 24% of the company’s shareholders. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about GE HealthCare Technologies. See our latest analysis for GE HealthCare Technologies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About GE HealthCare Technologies?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in GE HealthCare Technologies. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see GE HealthCare Technologies' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthGE HealthCare Technologies is not owned by hedge funds. General Electric Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 20% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.9% and 2.8% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of GE HealthCare TechnologiesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$60m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public -- including retail investors -- own 56% of GE HealthCare Technologies. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 20% of GE HealthCare Technologies stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

The chart below is a net positioning chart from the CFTC, also called Commitment of Traders (COT). This data shows the outstanding long and short positions in specific futures markets. This one shows the net positioning of large speculators in S&amp;P 500 futures, and it shows large net short positions. We can see that large speculators like hedge funds have their largest net short position in years. This data alone doesn’t tell us if we should be outright bullish or bearish, but it is valuable.If you look back in the data, you’ll see that when net short positioning gets stretched, like it is today, the market often rallies. Speculators get too bearish and the market rallies to shake them. This means that based on the current data, it’s very possible there is more upside to come in equity markets.CFTCImage Source: CFTCMeta PlatformsMeta Platforms META is the #1 performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 boasting an 83% return YTD. It is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Analysts have upgraded the current quarter earnings by 2% over the last 60 days, while FY23 and FY24 earnings have been revised higher by 11% and 14% respectively. User growth across Meta’s platforms as well as increased engagement has reassured investors and boosted the stock price.Story continuesAdditionally, tough decisions like large-scale layoffs and a major restructuring have demonstrated to investors that CEO Mark Zuckerberg is willing to prioritize profits and shareholders.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMETA is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 22x, which is above the market average but well below its 10-year median of 30x. META’s valuation got as low as 10x earnings at the end of 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSalesforceSalesforce CRM, like Meta, has undergone a massive restructuring over the last six months, laying off 8,000 employees, which is 10% of its workforce. Also, like Meta, investors have responded positively to the changes. The share price is up 47% YTD, making it the seventh strongest stock in the index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven after all the improvement and stock appreciation, analysts are still upgrading their estimates for Salesforce earnings. CRM stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings estimates have been revised higher by a minimum of 20% across timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSalesforce is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 40x, which is above the industry average 30x, and well below its three-year median of 100x. CRM continue to benefit from the secular trend of digital transformation, and sales are expected to grow 10% annually over the next two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGeneral ElectricA surprising addition to the top stocks of 2023 is General Electric GE. General Electric is one of the leaders of the past, but near-term expectations are strong, and clearly investors have been favoring the stock. GE is the eighth best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500, up 44% YTD.In the chart below we can see GE has experienced a considerable fall in popularity, and thus stock price. The stock is still -75% off its all-time high from back in 2000. But that doesn't mean it can’t be a good stock again. It has found support at the prior low of $40 and shows strong upside momentum.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewAdditionally, earnings are being revised higher, giving GE a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Current quarter and next quarter earnings are flat to up, but FY23 have been revised slightly higher, and FY24 expectations have climber 20%. Strong performance of the Aerospace segment has been the primary driver for GE’s sales growth, and the continued strong trend in the recovery bodes well for the stock.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGE is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 48x, well above the market average of 21x, and above its two-year median of 34x. One of the big risks for GE currently is its renewables segment. Lat quarter sales from renewables showed a decline of -19% YoY and were hurt by lower U.S. onshore wind volumes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThis year has been full of surprises. If there is one lesson from this year’s action, it is that investors must remain flexible. Getting stuck on a narrative and being unwilling to shift to changing market environments is an extremely dangerous trait. But if investors can be open-minded and objective about the data, they will be rewarded handsomely. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

U.S. Republican politicians applauded the move as responsive to their efforts to counter many companies' treatment of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.Galloway said the decision was driven with an eye on the varied views of its largely retail client base. While joining NZAM initially seemed like a good way to encourage companies to disclose more climate data, he said, it proved a poor fit for Vanguard's well-known funds built around indexes not set up to choose among companies like active portfolio managers.Story continues""Those indexes don't have a net-zero objective, so it would be misleading to suggest we were going to do something (on climate) absent action by the individual portfolio companies"" held by the funds, Galloway said.""This was an area of confusion,"" he said.(Reporting by Ross Kerber; editing by Diane Craft)]"

The move is expected to boost BP's position as a major producer in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico.Argos has a gross production capacity of up to 140,000 barrels of oil per day. It is a crucial part of BP's Mad Dog Phase 2 project, which aims to extend the life of the 1998-discovered super-giant oil field.

It also plays a vital role in the company’s strategy to boost its Gulf of Mexico production to around 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the middle of this decade.According to CEO Bernard Looney, Argos will strengthen BP’s position in the Gulf of Mexico for years to come.

264,60cf8b25-4ac0-3aaf-85da-a0e44b185cde,UNH,2023-04-15,"With 89% ownership, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/89-ownership-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-110101595.html,1681556461,STORY,['UNH'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies UnitedHealth Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions50% of the business is held by the top 16 shareholdersOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockIf you want to know who really controls UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 89% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of UnitedHealth Group. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UnitedHealth Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that UnitedHealth Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at UnitedHealth Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in UnitedHealth Group. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.0%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.0% and 7.0% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.6b of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand UnitedHealth Group better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements including -- included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earning reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and Form 8-K dated April 14, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.Story continuesAndrew Philip WittyThank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across Optum and UnitedHealthcare with revenue increasing 15% to $92 billion. This broad-based growth, combined with the continued focus of our colleagues on tight execution, helped us deliver first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.26, up 14% over last year. Year-to-date, UnitedHealthcare increased the number of people served in the U.S. by 1.2 million, about half of this total within our commercial offerings. At OptumHealth, we're now serving nearly 700,000 more patients under fully accountable value-based arrangements compared to just December 2022. Given the strength of these results, we're increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the full year to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share. I know one topic is front of mind for you this morning. So I'll start with Medicare Advantage. With the 2024 Medicare Advantage notice in hand, we now have greater clarity for the short- to midterm evolution of this important program. Our teams are working through the implications of the changes for 2024 and we'll be ready to submit bids in just a few weeks. While we remain concerned about some of the potential unintended consequences of the changes of the risk adjustment model, particularly around adequate diagnosis and support for people with diabetes, complex behavioral needs and more, we do appreciate CMS' decision to phase-in the changes. This phase-in will allow for more time to minimize the impacts on beneficiaries as we lean on the multiple levers available to us, including our ability to manage costs and our relentless focus on member and patient needs. We expect the many years of work and investment our teams have put into products and value differentiation as well as quality measures such as Star scores will enable us to continue to offer leading value to Medicare beneficiaries and to grow strongly for years to come. We're committed to working with CMS as stewards of the MA program, especially with its long-stated goal of promoting value-based care, which remains the best solution to promote equitable access, better health care outcomes, exceptional experiences and lower cost for the system. And importantly, it best supports people who have historically been underserved and who face fragmented, less effective care under traditional fee-for-service. Seniors know that with MA versus fee-for-service, they can access a more integrated and comprehensive suite of critical health benefits, including prescription medicines, vision, dental and hearing care. They can seek care in more convenient settings. They experience better health outcomes, such as an over 40% lower rate of avoidable hospitalizations and consistently derive much greater value. In fact, the typical Medicare Advantage senior spent about $2,000 a year less out of pocket compared to seniors in traditional Medicare. And well over 90% of seniors in Medicare Advantage report they are highly satisfied with their coverage and care. That's why more than 30 million Americans, fully half of all seniors, choose Medicare Advantage today. Over the past year, we focused on improving the consumer experience across our company. This consumer orientation is foundational in support of each of our growth priorities, including our approach to value-based care. For example, this year, we expect to serve more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based care arrangements through Optum, about double where we were at the end of 2021. These patients will be members of UnitedHealthcare benefit plans or one of the many other plans served by Optum. Many of them are in Medicare Advantage. And increasingly, we are serving people with Medicaid or commercial benefits, an important growth focus for the coming years. We spent well more than a decade investing in essential infrastructure and offering extensive practice transition support to enable tens of thousands of care providers to participate in this comprehensive value-based approach. By integrating traditional ambulatory care with specialty, behavioral and pharmacy care across in-clinic, virtual and in-home settings, we're delivering measurably better health outcomes for patients, all while improving access and lowering costs for people and the health care system overall. Our focus on consumers is helping to drive growth within health benefits, including strong growth in our commercial offerings and our early indications are for continued robust commercial growth in 2024. From our employee-centered Surest insurance offer, to our innovative financial services for both members and care providers, to our improved pharmacy home delivery services and 0 co-pays on life-saving drugs, through all of these initiatives and more, we are firmly on track to put the member, patient and consumer at the very heart of what we do. One last note on UnitedHealthcare benefits and the resumption of Medicaid redeterminations. Now that the process has started, we're working with our state partners and others to provide as much information and support as possible so people can understand and access their best coverage options. And we expect to be serving more people in our benefit programs when this process is completed. And now I'll turn it over to UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon. Dirk?Dirk C. McMahonThanks, Andrew. Picking up on redeterminations. For many months, we have been preparing to help people when this activity resumes, as it now has in over 20 states. We are working closely with Medicaid members to navigate eligibility guidelines and help find alternative coverage options if they are no longer Medicaid-eligible. This effort includes live outreach calls to educate and assist members with renewal process to ensure they retain their existing coverage or can transition to other plans. We are also engaged with employers to extend annual enrollment periods and drive awareness for employees who are eligible for coverage. With extended eligibility and increased subsidies, many people will qualify for other plans, some with no monthly premium. UnitedHealthcare is executing our detailed plans to ensure as many people as possible have uninterrupted access to coverage and care if they are no longer eligible for Medicaid. Let me now turn to the opportunity we have to more deeply and effectively serve people in their homes. Nearly all of the patients we'll add this year in fully accountable value-based relationships will have access to support through our home-based platform. Consumers value and benefit from services delivered in the home and we have expanded our capabilities to serve that need. I'll highlight 4 of our key capabilities in this important area. First, patient assessments, in-home clinical visits designed to identify care needs and help patients with other physical and social needs. This year, we expect to make more than 2.5 million visits to patients' homes and we continue to expand the scope of the clinical services offered in that setting. Next, care transitions. This entails supporting patients into and through post-acute settings, helping people to avoid hospital readmissions after an inpatient stay. This year, we will manage nearly 12 million care transitions, about twice as many as just 3 years ago. This plays an important role in helping people return safely home and in connecting patients with additional in-home support. Third area, senior community care. This is clinical care for seniors who live in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities and dedicated senior housing. Our clinical teams provide additional layers of care and on-call resources. And they coordinate among patients and their primary care provider, facility staff and caregivers, all contributing to strong quality of care and outcomes. And the fourth area of clinical capability is individual care and coordination for Medicare dual and chronic special needs patients. These patients frequently require a more individualized approach to care. On average, these patients are managing 9 different chronic conditions and taking multiple medications. Our high-touch approach leads to better outcomes, including an over 15% reduction in hospitalizations, high patient satisfaction with an NPS of nearly 80 with 99% of our patients in a 4-star or higher plan. Our recent combination with LHC Group expands in-home capabilities. LHC provides high-quality, compassionate home health, hospice and post-acute care services with over 12 million patient encounters each year. We will learn from and build upon LHC's capabilities, expanding the scope and acuity of the care we can provide in a patient's health. And finally, shifting to pharmacy care services. OptumRx just completed another strong growth season. We are winning new relationships by offering the lowest cost and strong service across a wide variety of customers from health plans, to labor and governments and to commercial employers. We help customers obtain the best net cost and we use our clinical expertise to help treat conditions that call for specialty medications. In addition, consumers are benefiting from efforts such as Price Edge, which gives them the best-price option whether on or off benefit; UnitedHealthcare's introduction last year of 0-cost life-saving drugs; and our ability to manage the introduction of biosimilars on equal footing with the existing branded product. In short, we have consumers' backs. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.John F. RexThank you, Dirk. Fundamental execution has long been an essential aspect of UnitedHealth Group's ability to deliver for all those we serve. We know that if we meet or exceed our commitments and strive to live up to our potential, we will continue to generate high-quality durable growth. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by the strong and accelerating growth achieved across the businesses of UHC and Optum. We accomplished this while continuing to expand upon the foundation, which will drive the future growth you have come to expect from us. Revenue in the first quarter of $92 billion grew by nearly $12 billion or 15% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. This growth was achieved by serving more people across all our businesses and importantly, by serving them more comprehensively. UnitedHealth Group served -- UnitedHealthcare served about 1.2 million more people in the first 3 months of the year with strong growth across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Optum revenues grew 25% to $54 billion. Care patterns remain largely consistent with recent trends. For example, inpatient trends continue to reflect the growing long-term movement towards ambulatory sites of care. Today, nearly 2/3 of orthopedic procedures are performed in outpatient and other ambulatory settings compared to under 1/4 just 5 years ago. Physician office activity continues to trend toward historic levels, while a few categories such as pediatrics remain lower. Emergency room visits remain modestly lower than historical levels with consumers seemingly more comfortable with virtual and walk-in care. Cancer and cardiac screenings are occurring at roughly pre-pandemic levels, helped in part by focused efforts to ensure people are obtaining appropriate preventive care. As always, we continue to closely analyze data for indications which could signal increasing acuity but have yet to see those emerge.Looking now at the performance of the individual businesses in the first quarter. OptumHealth revenues grew by 38% to $23 billion as we expanded the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements. Revenue per consumer served grew by 34% driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we can offer. OptumInsight revenues grew 40% to $4.5 billion. The revenue backlog reached $30.7 billion, an increase of nearly $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare.As we have discussed before, in the first half, we expect to continue to increase our integration and investment activities, which were a component in the first quarter results and we expect they will accelerate into the second quarter.OptumRx revenues grew 15%, surpassing $27 billion, driven by strong double-digit growth across the businesses, including in our community and home delivery pharmacies. Script growth of 26 million over last year was driven by exceptional customer retention as well as new customer adds.We continue to see strong growth in NPS for our specialty businesses, up nearly 10 points since last year. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of over $70 billion grew 13% with growth in the number of people served across all of our major benefit categories. For example, in commercial, we set out to serve up to 1 million more people this year and are pacing well to that objective given our first quarter performance. Offerings for large employers led the gains as did our newer and more affordable offerings serving both employers and individuals.Within Medicare Advantage, we shared with you in November our intention to add 800,000 to 900,000 new members in this year and we now expect to exceed the upper end of that range. The consistent consumer receptivity to our offerings underscores the product stability and value we provide for seniors.Medicaid membership grew 570,000 over the year ago quarter. We continue to have momentum in Medicaid with recent wins in Indiana and Texas. And we are honored to advance our existing service to the people of North Carolina, as the state moves towards expanding managed Medicaid offerings.Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flows from operations in the quarter at $16.3 billion reflected an additional CMS payment. Adjusting for this effect, first quarter cash flows from operations were consistent with our outlook and we continue to track well with our full year view to approach $28 billion, about 1.2x net income.In the quarter, we returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and deployed about $8 billion of growth capital to expand our capabilities to serve more people and grow far into the future.As Andrew mentioned, based upon this growth outlook, today, we increased our full year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share. We expect the first half, second half earnings progression to be broadly consistent with our longer-term historical patterns with the second half comprising just slightly more than half of the full year.Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.Andrew Philip WittyThanks, John. Our comments on this call gives us a flavor of why we're confident in our outlook for the year and our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth target. Our growth is broad-based and it's driven within and increasingly across our businesses, bolstered, as always, by an enterprise focus on execution on behalf of those we serve.With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. (Operator Instructions)Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And we will go ahead and take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceMaybe just because it's been in the news as well the whole review of PBMs and some of the approaches the industry has had historically, maybe I'll just ask you guys to remind us what your approach is relative to rebates, spread pricing and so forth. And then I know OptumRx does a lot more than a traditional PBM. Maybe give people some perspective on the breadth of OptumRx relative to some of the things that are specifically being discussed in Washington today, if possible.Andrew Philip WittyYes. A.J., thanks so much for the question. Let me make a couple of comments and then I'm going to hand to Heather Cianfrocco, who looks after our OptumRx business. So first off, I mean, I think the entire space of pharmacy is a critical one within health care. It's the most common touch point for the health system. It's also an incredibly significant part of the system in terms of where innovation comes into the marketplace. So where an important set of activities which need to be delivered effectively on behalf of patients, members, consumers.Having said that, of course, it's all about affordability and value for money. And there is a real risk, if you see situations where you have essentially monopoly holders, so let's say, drug companies that have a monopoly over a particular product, there needs to be a counterbalance in terms of the price negotiation to make sure that those prices are effectively procured on behalf of members who otherwise would just not have that kind of ability to negotiate.That's really the central role that the PBMs play here. There are various mechanisms in which the PBM operates. The rebate mechanism is one that historically has been used in this way. As you well know, A.J., Optum, OptumRx in particular, has led the way in terms of transparency and making sure that, for example, the overwhelming majority of rebates are passed back to the payers of those drugs, typically the plans or the employers who commission us to procure on their behalf.As we look more broadly across the whole landscape of the pharmacy marketplace, there are a few things that I think we strongly believe in and we continue to advocate for very significantly. #1, there needs to be a counterbalance to the drug company pricing and the only players in the market right now who are really advocating hard for reducing cost is the PBM.#2, at Optum, we are committed to lowest net cost. And whether we get there through rebate or we get there through lower list prices, we don't mind. We're very happy when people cut list prices because that cuts cost. We're very happy when we secure increased rebates because that cuts costs. So we continue to focus on that lowest net cost and we're super committed to transparency. We're also committed to finding ways in which we can bring benefits directly to patients, which is why we led last year with 0 cost pay for the UnitedHealthcare books of business initially for life-saving drugs.So that's kind of the big landscape. Now there's more detail in areas that maybe Heather could take you into and I'll pass to her now to give you a little bit more. Heather?Heather Rachelle CianfroccoSure. Thank you. And maybe I will just supplement and just say -- A.J., thank you. We are -- certainly, it is in the news. We're mindful of the interest in this essential service. But I guess I'd also point you to the client need for these essential services. Our PBM services not just negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to drive that lowest net cost for drugs available, as Andrew mentioned, but the clinical supports and services through the pharmacy and therapeutics committees and pipeline reviews, that network administration and all of the benefit administration and consultation that we provide to clients of all sizes and types from government to employer to large, sophisticated health plans.And I take validation in the fact that, that business model is needed by our clients and it's appreciated. The transparent business model of OptumRx, together with the innovative capabilities, some of our differentiated strategies, like the biosimilar strategy that Andrew mentioned that not just brought competition into the market by bringing up to 3 biosimilars at parity with the originator on the formulary, accepting the high list price and the list price and putting those together and offering them to the clients from our consumer tools like our latest Price Edge that does scan across the market and compares the cash pricing with the members' real-time out-of-pocket cost to make sure they get the best price.Those are innovative offerings that I'm really proud that our clients find valuable. And we evolve with those needs. So I think I'd point us to the fact that we had a very strong selling season, one of the highest over the last years, in terms of retention and new clients, shows that the services are needed. We'll continue to evolve our business models to our clients' needs while we continue to engage policymakers and others to make sure that everybody understands the essential value of that PBM service, the distinctive capabilities and transparent business model of OptumRx and in addition, make sure that we ensure client choice and we preserve that function.But I guess that also -- I'll just take the opportunity to say, you're right. OptumRx is so much more than just our PBM, which is incredibly important to our clients. We are so proud of them. I'm so proud of the team. You saw the growth in our pharmacies but from our community pharmacies that it just celebrated a 700th opening of our behavioral health pharmacy, a very distinctive offering in the market to our specialty with not just high NPS but a 24/7 clinical model and distinctive capabilities for those members that really benefit from specialty drugs but in oftentimes, need our patient support and assistance, including financial.And then, of course, our infusion business, which is very intimate in providing services in the home and we rely on over 1,100 nurses to do that every day. So incredibly proud of the breadth of service across OptumRx but very mindful that our job in the PBM is to serve our clients and preserve their choice.Andrew Philip WittyThanks, Heather. And all of that said, I think what is also really validating here, A.J., just look at the growth rate in the first quarter, 15% growth. It really reflects the competitiveness of the portfolio we have. And as I talk to our clients, what they really appreciate is the degree to which we're innovating the pharmacy model, more and more transparency, more and more pressure on bringing down those costs. That's why people are moving to us and it's why they're not leaving us, record levels of retention within this portfolio.And just as a marker, about half of our revenues in the OptumRx portfolio come from non-PBM activities. That's all the stuff that Heather just referred to in the second part of her answer. Super nicely balanced business, great growth profile because we're delivering for clients and for their members and employees. So A.J., thanks for raising that question. It's an important topic and we appreciate having the chance to share it.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.Lisa Christine GillI'm going to stick to the PBM side for a minute and just really wanted to hear your comments around GLP-1 drugs. One, how do we think about the cost trend as you think about it from the managed care side of your business? And then secondly, how do we think about really truly managing this new cost of drug that's coming from a pharmacy perspective?Andrew Philip WittyYes. Lisa, it's a great question. I think, actually, it would be super interesting to hear from the UnitedHealthcare perspective on that. So I may just ask Brian Thompson, the CEO of UHC, to comment there, please.Brian Robert ThompsonSure, Andrew. Lisa, let me start with the trends that we're seeing here in 2023 are as planned, overall medical and pharmacy. It's really a good start to the year with our assumptions being validated as we kick off 2023. With respect to GLP, obviously, a lot of discussion. I would say no real change to either our insights or our position. We have seen an increase in trend in GLP-1s. The overwhelming majority of that is in diabetic care and it is as we had expected, low single digits in terms of weight loss use.I would say that our on-label usage has been well managed with our authorization requirements. And I think it's important to put it in the context of our overall medical. Keep in mind, pharmacy is about 20% of our overall spend in any one therapeutic class. This one certainly included less than 1%. So increased year-over-year, overwhelming majority in diabetic care, well managed in terms of off-label use and consistent with what we had planned for.Andrew Philip WittyYes. No. Listen, Brian puts it super well, Lisa. I think from where we sit, as we roll forward -- listen, first of all, it's good news that we're seeing innovation in areas like weight management. That obviously is going to be an important aspect of consideration for people, particularly with comorbidities. Diabetes is an obvious example of that, #1.#2, I think as time plays out, what's going to be super critical here is some of the -- we need to get focused on the facts and reality of this marketplace. We need to really be clear about which patients really do benefit from these medicines and make sure we properly understand how they're going to use those medicines. So there's a lot still to learn, I think, as these things progress through their final phases.And then finally, of course, we got to see the prices be affordable and that's going to be a key element of how this evolves. And obviously, we keep a close eye on the prices we see in Europe. And just as -- you heard a little bit, our focus on the pharmacy side of the business, of course, encouraged by our insurance side of the business. We're going to be looking for the very, very best pricing on these medicines and we're going to advocate on behalf of members and consumers to get that.So still plenty to come here. I think early days, nothing particularly out of expectations, still very much in the range that Brian just described. Lisa, thanks for the question.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.Stephen C. BaxterI wanted to ask about the changes the company is making to prior authorization later this year. It would be great to get some background on why you felt like these changes were necessary and how you're going to work to manage the cost implications of the changes once they're made.Andrew Philip WittyYes. Steven, thanks so much for the question. I'll ask Brian to address that.Brian Robert ThompsonSteven, thanks for the question. Yes, beginning in the third quarter of this year, we will be eliminating about 20% of our authorization volumes overall. We're also going to be eliminating most medical authorizations altogether for provider groups and systems that have demonstrated a high-quality care and adherence to the requirements over time. I'd say that might be another 10% of our volumes overall.We'll continue to evaluate with some new analytics that we have in partnership with OptumInsight and surveillance capabilities to see if there's some additional opportunities over time. Really, though, this is a culmination of a lot of things. And first and foremost, I would say it's our intensifying focus on the consumer experience, really a desire for us to streamline processes, get the latency out of the process. And like I said, leverage new technologies to really get to speed of decisioning and really get to point of care.I will say, we're constantly reviewing our prior authorizations but we need to balance, obviously, what we reduce with that need to guard against clinical quality and patient safety. And I would say in this really robust process that we've started here over the last several months that it's really demonstrated the importance of the authorizations that we do have in place.So really encouraged by our surveillance capabilities. Don't anticipate any pressure on trend because of it and really see this as a win and satisfier for both our customers and our provider groups alike.Andrew Philip WittyYes. Brian, thanks so much. I might just add, I think as we play out over the next year or 2, this is also an exciting area for where UHC and OptumInsight can collaborate, lot of technology opportunity to be leveraged here, Stephen.And also as you think about the integration of the Change organization into OptumInsight, that gives us new perspective in terms of how we can create network connectivity, to take friction out as well.So how do we -- well, you just heard a little bit there from Brian, is how we kind of streamline this space. It's still got an important role at its core. Then there's a ton of opportunity we can bring to really take out a lot of that friction by leveraging technology and the capabilities that we're building up within the new OptumInsight. So really an interesting space across the whole organization. Thanks so much, Stephen and Brian.OperatorNext question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.Justin LakeJust wanted to sneak in a couple of quick numbers questions. First, on EPS seasonality. It looks like second quarter -- it sounds like you might be looking at closer to kind of flattish EPS year-over-year. Wondering if you can kind of walk through the moving parts there. I know you talked about spending more money on Change, for instance.And then just anything on DCP, what range should we be thinking about there in terms of going forward? Is this a kind of -- it went down in the quarter. Is this a more normal range? Kind of where do you see that kind of settling out for the year?Andrew Philip WittyYes. Justin, thanks so much. I'll ask John Rex to comment there, please.John F. RexJustin, so a few thoughts here in terms of seasonality comments. So yes, this quarter reflected some impacts actually from Change also, so I wouldn't call that seasonality. But these are investments we're making as we integrate and we build OptumInsight for the future. And I'd put that in the zone of $100 million or so of impact in the quarter and expect that to be a little bit higher actually in the second quarter also.In terms of full year seasonality, also, I just want to give a little commentary on that. I expect that to be kind of in the zone of what we have historically done, where you see just a little bit more than half of the earnings generated in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So more similar to, if you look to kind of pre-2019 and back, those kind of patterns, that we would typically show.On your commentary -- on your question on DCPs and expectations there, at this level, I would tell you, it's probably more in the level that we typically would have run also pre-pandemic, in terms of the levels of days claims payable that we would typically run.A few things just in terms of commentary and just seeing some of the impacts, just so that get really close on it. So in addition to being at what we would consider to be kind of normalized levels here, some business mix impacts. Some of the areas we're growing in and growing rapidly in have somewhat faster payment cycles. In the first quarter, there's usually a little impact also from Part D seasonality. And kind of on the sequential move there, I'd say there's a little -- just a little bit of day count impact also in terms of -- that was affecting those.Andrew Philip WittyThanks so much, John. Thanks, Justin.OperatorNext question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.Nathan Allen RichI wanted to ask on Medicare Advantage and the phase-in of the risk model changes by CMS. I guess, how might the prospect for lower rate growth over the next few years impact the relative attractiveness of Medicare Advantage for seniors and the growth of that market? And do you think the risk model changes have any impact on how providers are viewing the attractiveness of full-risk arrangements?Andrew Philip WittyNathan, thanks so much for the question. So listen, I think as you sort of step back here, a couple of things I'd probably just want to make super clear. First off, we really appreciate CMS' decision to phase-in these changes. That was important and we're very glad to see that. It really allows for the transition to be managed effectively really with we think and a bit -- certainly, our goal is to have a transition here, which really protects the beneficiaries, make sure that it doesn't in any way kind of damage the program. Of course, it requires us to do things a little differently in some areas. But fundamentally, we think that was really important and we very, very much appreciate that.As we kind of look out to 2024, we're going to be guided by 2 really important principles here, Nathan. #1, we're going to be doing what's absolutely right for the beneficiaries as we always do. So that's going to guide us in terms of how we are active. And #2, we're going to be driving to sustain our robust membership growth in this space.We believe this is an incredibly important program for seniors. We think value-based care as a piece of this program is a crucial and best way of managing members to give them the best quality outcome, best experience and best cost outcome.Given our established capabilities and our ability to focus on cost management as well as the broad portfolio of value-based services, clinics, in-house activities provided by Optum, we feel super confident in our ability to manage the evolving funding landscape.So overall, yes, it's changed but kind of this change every year. This is a little different change to the changes we've had in other years but it's all -- these programs are always evolving. We feel, given the portfolio of capabilities we have, super well equipped to be able to pull different levers to be responsive to this, to make sure that we can look after beneficiaries.I'd also say that the experience we've seen in Optum, the popularity of value-based care for physicians, the way in which they like to be able to concentrate and focus on patients longitudinally, so really think about how to understand, diagnose, prevent, treat, manage that patient through the whole cycle rather than just sporadically through a fee-for-service intervention, that's a sustaining popular thing.We brought in about 10,000 or more new clinicians last year between physicians and advanced practice clinicians. I think we're going to do about the same this year. Honestly, we're seeing significant numbers of people coming in. And we would continue to expect to see value-based care continue to be a very important part of the future growth of the marketplace and, of course, for us.So as we sit today, of course, we have to do things to respond to the changing environment. We feel good about our ability to do it. And I appreciate the question, Nathan.OperatorAnd we will move on to our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.Joshua Richard RaskinI want to stay on MA and maybe more specifically, if you could speak to the impact to both, I guess, UnitedHealthcare and OptumCare and more specifically, how you plan to balance the need to maintain attractive benefits to grow that membership against your ability to achieve target margins?And maybe do you think the industry will grow at similar rates? It sounds like you don't see a material impact long term but I'm just curious if you think 2024 as an industry growth rate looks similar to what we've seen in recent years? And maybe within that, how you expect UHC to fare?Andrew Philip WittyYes. Josh, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Brian to give you a few thoughts. Brian?Brian Robert ThompsonJosh, thanks for the question. I'll just reiterate, I think what Andrew said. Certainly, this 3-year phase-in gives us an opportunity to minimize this impact on beneficiaries. And I will just reiterate the optimism that Andrew shared. Because of that, that gives us time to really evaluate our cost structure.First and foremost, I think that's the consideration that we are deeply focused on to make sure that we manage this impact. Look, it's not the first time that we have had to navigate a rate environment like this. So I'll just say we remain optimistic about MA and the value prop that it has broadly. We certainly feel very good about our market position in it. We intend to grow again in 2024, as Andrew had said. We expect the marketplace to continue to grow in 2024. And we continue to lead with the strong momentum that we've demonstrated for many years now.So we're obviously in the middle of our benefit planning but I can just share with you that we are encouraged and optimistic.Andrew Philip WittyGreat. Thanks so much, Brian. I appreciate it. Thanks, Josh.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.Lance Arthur WilkesCould you talk a little bit about OptumCare and the full-risk patients you've got, specifically the non-UnitedHealthcare patients? And how is the progress going as far as growing that? And how do you see this MA rate environment and high premium environment in commercial employer impacting and potentially accelerating your ability to add non-UHC risk patients?Andrew Philip WittySo Lance, thanks so much for the question. Let me just make a couple of upfront comments and I'll ask Dr. Wyatt Decker, who looks after OptumHealth, to give you a little more detail.So first off, you're seeing now, as we head toward the full year here, 4 million or so fully capitated lives within OptumHealth, still under full delegation. That's an incredible progression over the last 2 or 3 years. It's what's really -- you can see a real differentiation. Super important to remember that, that is being supported not just by clinics. Oftentimes, people think about just clinics. Within OptumHealth, this is really broadly integrated support service. So this could be Optima Home. This is in the clinic, it's behavioral, it's virtual. It's a really comprehensive set of capabilities that underpin that and we believe provides fantastic service for the members who are delegated. You see that growth rate continuing to be super strong, 700,000 already transferred this year. It's extraordinary first quarter for OptumHealth.As you step back and look underneath the hood of all of that, of course, UHC is a big piece of it. But there is a very substantial non-UHC delegation quantum in there, which continues to grow well. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, an increase in diversification of that value base as a treatment strategy as it moves into commercial risk and also Medicaid. So really important diversification.Maybe just talk a little bit why, give a little more detail in terms of how you're thinking about the next year or so.Wyatt W. DeckerYes. Well, thank you, Lance and thank you, Andrew. I would underscore some of Andrew's comments. But most particularly, we have developed a comprehensive and differentiated clinical model of care for value-based care. And that is appealing to all of the large national payers who we work with closely, Lance.And so you'll see us continuing to grow our book of value-based care lives with all national payers and regional payers who see the value that we're able to provide both to them and to the members and hence, patients that we serve.And you heard a little bit earlier today from Dirk McMahon on our comprehensive home and community offerings and that's just one of our many platforms. And we weave these together in a comprehensive fashion and we think about not just the member, but the person or patient at the other side of this who's on a journey of health care. And some have multiple chronic diseases. Some want to focus on staying healthy and well and some have catastrophic issues that we have to help them navigate effectively. And our ability to do that is unique and differentiated in the health care industry.So I think you'll see continued growth with multiple payers. We have enjoyed that this year and will continue to do so as the year progresses. And as Andrew touched on, we really view ourselves not as solely a senior health care provider but as a provider for all walks and ages of lives and particularly commercial. So we have commercial offerings in Texas, in California and Massachusetts today and they're a meaningful part of our 4 million fully capitated lives already today. And you'll see us continuing to grow in those established markets with commercial and multiple payers as well as going into new markets. Thank you.Andrew Philip WittyThanks, Wyatt. Lance, thanks so much for the question.OperatorNext question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.Kevin Mark FischbeckI just want to go back to MA for a minute. You guys -- it sounds like you're saying the MA changes that are happening are not significant enough to -- in isolation as a individual component to take you off your 13% to 16% EPS growth targets over the next few years. I just want to clarify that.But then I understand that the 3-year phase-in is important to allow you to adjust to it. But at the same time, trying to understand, if there's a way to think about this. Are you thinking about the impact as being ratable? Or is it a scenario where it's easier to offset it in the beginning because there's always low-hanging fruit and it's harder to offset the impact in year 3? Or is it the opposite, where it's harder to offset the impact in year 1 because you don't have enough time to adjust and it's easier to impact in year 3 as you have more and more time to adjust? Just trying to figure out if there's a difference in how this will play out over the next 3 years and how we should think about your growth?Andrew Philip WittyKevin, thanks so much for the question. So to your first point, no, you're absolutely right. We remain firmly of the view that the 13% to 16% long-term growth rate of adjusted earnings per share is very much the zone we're in. We -- you see that again this quarter. We continue to believe that is very much in our horizon as we go forward. Obviously, any given quarter might vary around that but that very much is the zone we expect and I made that comment a little bit earlier. So for sure on that.Listen, as far as this -- the phase-in comes, this will all depend -- different companies will behave differently, I suspect, through all of this. And we see, of course, this change here. We will be making changes to some things in our costs and other areas, as Brian talked about earlier on. Other providers may choose to do things differently.How it plays out, I think, is actually going to be a little bit of a competitive environment, actually and I think it's not something we probably want to get too much into in terms of predicting or sharing exactly how we're going to respond to this. We're getting close to a bid cycle. It's a super important time. We are deeply fixated on making sure that we continue to grow. To do that, we need to make sure that our bids are super competitive. And we're working on that and we'll work our way through it.And as I said earlier, the phase-in gives us confidence that we can align with where CMS wants to end up in a way which gives the best chance of beneficiaries being looked after appropriately and that's what we want to try and do. Thanks so much for the question.OperatorNext question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.Erin Elizabeth Wilson WrightOn your commercial risk membership, can you speak to what you are seeing there? And is there anything to glean in terms of how Surest is tracking relative to your expectations?Andrew Philip WittyErin, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask [Dan Kito], who runs our E&amp;I business to respond. Dan?Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks, Erin, for the question. And yes, our momentum in the first quarter clearly continued the momentum we had in the back half of last year and puts us well on track, as John said in his prepared remarks, to meet our investor conference goal -- investor conference targets rather, of [$850 million to $1.5 billion] growth. Surest was a component of that. Surest was a component, about -- accounting for about 25% of our growth in the quarter as that product continues to be adopted. We've shared before that 1 in 9 of our national accounts actually have that product today. We're continuing to see that expand down into the middle market currently as the growth of that product continues. And we also are beginning to experience take-up now on a fully insured basis for that product on a risk basis.We shared at the investor conference that Surest was available in 12 states on an insured basis with a year-end target for this year of upwards of 35 states. We currently offer that product in 25 states. So it is a meaningful contributor to our growth and we expect it to be so for the remainder of the year and into the future. Thanks for the question, Erin.Andrew Philip WittyDan, thank you so much. And I just might add something here, Erin, as well. I mean, I think you can see in this Q, you saw it as we rolled into the second half of last year, we're optimistic for the rest of this year. I said earlier that we are expecting continued robust growth on commercial insurance into '24. We really feel like this engine has lit up again and it's super important for the organization. Alongside the fantastic growth you're seeing in the government books of business, in Medicaid and Medicare, we're now seeing the commercial business really come to the fore again, which is a fantastic thing to see within the company.What you've also just heard a little bit is the way in which Optum is developing its capability to be ready to add even more value to the commercial. So just as that Optum business has built up strength to complement UHC's leadership in Medicare, for example, you just heard Dr. Decker talking about doing the same thing in commercial. As that growth comes in from Dan's organization, you can see how that could play out, is the super important shift and having all those engines fire in simultaneously is really good for us and it's what's driving this growth we're seeing in Q1. So thanks for the question, Erin.OperatorNext question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.Benjamin HendrixWe've received a number of questions on the EMIS acquisition in the U.K., especially now with the CMA's phase 2 investigation. And I know you can't comment on that specifically. But I was wondering if you could recap the key strategic priorities with this acquisition and discuss the specific capabilities within the platform that OptumInsight or other businesses can leverage.Andrew Philip WittyYes. Ben, thanks so much for the question. Yes, obviously, I can't get into the detail of the regulatory review. But a couple of things to say. So for a long time, many years, Optum has had a business in the U.K. Obviously, the U.K. is a very different type of marketplace to the U.S., but it has a couple of interesting -- very interesting components.One is, you've got very much a primary care-dominated environment, which is obviously very akin to big pieces of OptumHealth. And it's also a marketplace which has looked to develop its abilities around data and connectivity.EMIS, which is the company we are very keen to partner with, we think could be a very important complement to Optum capabilities, particularly as it speaks to helping us connect some of our software capabilities, data analytic capabilities to primary care providers. About 40% of British primary care providers are connected into the EMIS networks. We think that gives a great opportunity to bring fantastic value to the physician practices and then ultimately to the National Health Service.And what we'd like to believe, if we're able to go through that transaction, is that it can really allow us to start to create another node of innovation alongside all of our other technology platforms to start to develop technology software platforms and the like, which not only could be used in a market like the U.K. but in other economies around the world which perhaps have slightly different shaped health care systems to the U.S. health care system. So we see this as good for the U.K. We think it's potentially an interesting opportunity to further enhance our investments and progress in technology and software development. And it's why we're keen to continue the process to get the transaction done. And obviously, we will be working diligently on that. Thanks so much for the question, Ben.OperatorNext question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.Scott J. FidelWas actually hoping just to revisit the full year revenue guidance. Just given the first quarter, clearly, you were pacing better than The Street and you've since closed LHCG. And you're now looking to eclipse the high end of your MA target for the year. So clearly, it seems like there's a lot of upside momentum relative to the initial guidance you gave at Investor Day. I know you don't typically update the revenue guidance intra-quarter or during the quarters but certainly interested if maybe you can give us some refined thinking around that.Andrew Philip WittyYes. Thanks so much. Let me ask John to comment.John F. RexScott, yes, good strength and growth really across the businesses in the quarter. And we're through some of those areas really across both UHC and Optum in terms of the strength we're seeing in terms of membership growth; in terms of the performance of the other businesses, OptumRx, a call-out here in terms of the strength they've seen in terms of their new customer wins and retention; and OptumHealth in its growth in value-based lives. So all strong contributors to that.And yes, we're a little ahead of kind of where the view was in terms of the external view on revenue guidance. So certainly, we're positively biased in terms of the type of growth that we're seeing across the enterprise. Happy to see that. You're also right, probably not doing any updates here in the first quarter in terms of that full year view at this distance but really a strong place to start the year. Thank you.Andrew Philip WittyThanks, John.OperatorOur last question will come from David Windley with Jefferies.David Howard WindleyI wanted to ask another question on MA and value-based care. I'm wondering if the risk model, Andrew, changes your views about the target member in MA, that is, say, most attractive to target between individual MA versus duals.And in value-based care, seeing the nice growth, particularly interesting to us that the eliminations grew a lot, which I'm inferring is intercompany between OptumHealth and UHC. And I'm wondering if that is a signal that duals were a big part of the value-based care add in the first quarter. So kind of a [weeds] question but strategically, basically interested to know if duals are still a very important target for MA.Andrew Philip WittySo David, thanks so much for the question. So you're quite right, the eliminations are -- a big piece of that is the Optum Health UHC dynamic and not surprising because you see such a high rate transfer in Q1. A large fraction of that 700,000 is UHC, not -- obviously, others as well but a large fraction. And of course, within that, as we guided last year, significant proportion of dual special need patients who -- most complex patients, really, I think, particularly appropriate patients to benefit from a value-based care approach where you have a really integrated wraparound sort of capabilities. So it's certainly true on all of that.I'm going to slightly disagree with your premise here. We're not in the business of targeting a certain type of member or patient. We want to look after Medicare patients and members, whether they are community MA, whether they're dual special need, whether they're complex or not, whether they're early in their disease in an aging patent or advanced in their disease in an aging patent. And then the job for our organization is to mix and match our capabilities to do that as efficiently as possible.And the great thing about OptumHealth, David, is that we have such an interesting portfolio of capabilities, which allow us to dial up and down our activities in response to what the patient needs and the way in which they need to be looked after.So I would say we're going to be continuing to lean in across the board. It's just as important to us to grow in dual special needs as well as community MA. And I'd say that the progress we make in terms of impacting these folks' lives and the reason why over 90% of members describe this as a high-satisfaction space is because they -- these people need the support at this stage of their life. And we think that between the programs that UHC offer and then the backup that OptumHealth brings in terms of deep clinical engagement really makes a difference and that's what drives us.David, appreciate the question. Thank you very much and I'm afraid we're at the end of the call. I hope you leave this call with a sense of our optimism and focus on continued growth for the year ahead. We remain intent on expanding our ability to help improve health care at the system and individual levels and executing with excellence for all those we serve. And we look forward to sharing our progress on this journey with you again in July. In the meantime, thank you so much for your questions and your attention this morning. Thank you.OperatorAnd with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Investors are constantly being reminded of this average. It's like a barometer. It's like a snapshot of the stock market. But what exactly is it? The Dow is composed of 30 American companies, and it's supposed to be representative of the overall market and most of the big sectors of the economy.Taking a look at the Dow components, you can see it includes some technology stocks. You've got Apple. Microsoft is in there. You have some financial stocks, like JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs. You've got health care stocks like UnitedHealth Group, Boeing, an industrial stock. And then some consumer facing stocks as well, like Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Walmart is in there.Now, the Dow is a price weighted index. A company's weight on the index is determined by the stock price. So UnitedHealth Group has the highest stock price among the components. Goldman Sachs is the second highest, followed by Home Depot. So when those stocks move up or down, they have a bigger impact on the overall point index movement.Now, the Dow, though, isn't technically an average. To get an average, you need to add up all the share prices and divide that by 30. But keep in mind, companies do stock splits and have dividends. So nowadays, the sum of the stock prices is divided by what's called a Dow divisor. And it's a number which changes frequently, and it takes into account stock splits and dividends. Fun fact-- no stock has been in the average for the entire lifespan of the Dow. The components change over the years as the economy changes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is more than 125 years old.DAVE BRIGGS: Excellent breakdown, Ines Ferre. Thanks so much. Enjoy the weekend.INES FERRE: You, too.]"

The Nasdaq fell 0.4% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.2%.Fed Governor Christopher Waller said further rate hikes were still needed to curb inflation, adding that investors shouldn’t “expect rates to fall any time soon.”The hawkish remarks from Waller pushed the United States 2-Year sharply higher as investors upped their bets on further Fed monetary policy tightening ahead just as data showed signs of weakness in the consumer.The report showed “further slowing in consumer spending, but importantly, not a sharp deterioration,” Morgan Stanley said in a note. “The largest declines were driven by a reversal in gas prices, but there was also broad-based weakness across nearly every category of spending,” it added.The backdrop of rising rates weighed on tech with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling more than 1% followed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

That is because the Jun 16, 2023 $5.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Macerich shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Macerich is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry that ranks in the Top 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 43 cents per share to 42 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Macerich right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand.Given this backdrop, The Macerich Company’s MAC portfolio of premium shopping centers in the United States, with a notable presence in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor, has been experiencing solid leasing activity. The healthy demand has also helped the company backfill its spaces, which is encouraging.Moreover, these markets are densely populated and have an affluent customer base with significant disposable income, which enables the company to generate decent cash flows. This positions it well for growth.In 2022, Macerich signed 974 new and renewal leases encompassing around 3.8 million square feet. Its portfolio occupancy improved year over year from 91.5% to 92.6% on Dec 31, 2022.Additionally, the company recently welcomed Chinese restaurant Din Tai Fung to Santa Monica Place, fashion retailer — Zara — and Irish retail brand — Primark — to Queens Center in New York City.Macerich has been focusing on enhancing its asset quality and customer relationships by increasing its adoption of the omni-channel model. It has also shifted toward re-use and mixed-used properties by recapturing and repositioning anchor tenants.This April, MAC announced that it would showcase ticketed attractions, The Dr. Seuss Experience and World of Barbie, at Tysons Corner Center and Santa Monica Place, respectively. Both these attractions are being introduced to Macerich by Kilburn Live, a global market leader in branded live entertainment, collectively with Fever, the leading entertainment discovery platform. This is expected to pull in more traffic at MAC’s top-performing properties.  Furthermore, Macerich’s aggressive capital-recycling program to enhance the overall quality of its portfolio highlights its prudent capital-management practices and releases the pressure off its balance sheet.On the balance sheet front, Macerich had around $512 million of liquidity as of Dec 31, 2022. Its net debt to forward EBITDA, excluding leasing costs, was 8.8X as of the same date. With a well-laddered debt maturity profile and enough financial flexibility, MAC is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Nonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is concerning for Macerich. Also, limited consumers’ willingness to spend due to macroeconomic uncertainty could impair the company’s top-line growth. For 2023, we project funds from operations (FFO), excluding financing expenses in connection with Chandler Freehold, to fall 8.8% year over year.Rising interest rates might increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of the Zacks #3 (Hold) firm have gained 5.8% in the past six months compared with its industry’s growth of 14.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Urstadt Biddle Properties UBA, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

275,e28640f2-c451-3f38-b021-f53339b16abc,DHI,2023-04-15,3 Stocks to Sell for the Housing Market Crash,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-sell-housing-market-113020368.html,1681299020,STORY,"['DHI', 'RDFN', 'EARN']","[There’s so much to consider when looking for stocks to sell.Will there or won’t there be another housing market crash? The answer is that nobody knows with precise certainty. Doomsdayers claim that weaker stocks, a recession, higher mortgage rates, and a cooling jobs market could conspire to expose massive unseen cracks. Maybe they’re right. Until a few weeks ago, the experts claimed the banking sector was solid. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCurrently, the same experts explain that home equity and more credit-worthy borrowers make this housing market fundamentally incomparable to that of 2005-2007. It feels eerily similar to claims late last year that if we experience a recession in 2023, it’ll merely be a soft landing. Yet, the likelihood of a hard landing is much higher now. In other words, a crash remains entirely impossible, making these the housing stocks to sell. EARNEllington Residential Mortgage REIT$7.26RDFNRedfin $9.12DHID.R. Horton$99.77Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT (EARN)a person in a suit holds a tiny house to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockEllington Residential Mortgage REIT (NYSE:EARN) is exactly the asset you don’t want to if the housing market crashes. The company invests heavily in all things related to mortgages including residential and commercial mortgage loans and residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities are investments that are secured by a collection of mortgages and packaged as an investment. During the financial crisis, they became infamous because of a lack of oversight that allowed subprime borrowers to access mortgages en masse. That may not be present in this case but the possibility exists. In any case, EARN stock is very clearly risky based on its high-yield dividend that pays 13.24% currently. That’s well above the level any advisor would term ‘healthy’ and functions as an enticement. Such high dividends ought to be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism. In any case, if the housing market crashes, EARN stock is the last place you’ll want your capital parked. This is definitely one of the stocks to sell now.Story continuesRedfin (RDFN) Redfin sign posted in front of a house for sale; Redfin (RDFN) is a real estate brokerage whose business model is based on sellers paying Redfin a small feeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIt stands to reason that real estate services firms including Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) are stocks to avoid in a housing crash. And that is true. Redfin has seen its share price decline from $90 in early 2021 to under $9 currently. The company reduced its risk substantially in late 2022 when it shuttered its iBuyer unit and cut 13% of its labor force. Redfin overextended itself through the iBuying model that leveraged algorithms to quickly identify purchase-worthy homes. The problem is that the algorithm clearly wasn’t that great as the homes purchased weren’t able to be resold at higher prices as the Fed raised rates. It appears the algorithm didn’t consider basic risk assessments. Redfin lost a lot of money because of it. Anyway, the company is still fraught with risk now. Recessionary conditions and increasing job losses affect the firm directly as home sales plummet under those conditions. In turn, it receives far less revenue as volume declines. D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comD.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) stock might not seem to be in too bad of a position. It headed into 2023 with a strong performance in Q1 on an earnings and revenues beat. It seems the home builder can’t miss, even as rising mortgage rates should slow its business substantially. Demand slowed and new orders decreased by 38% in Q1 ‘23 relative to Q1 ‘21, but the company and its shares continued to do well and may continue to. However, there are a few things about D.R. Horton worth understanding. One, we don’t know what kind of credit risk the firm has because it doesn’t publicly release its mortgage approval criteria. And two, there are serious concerns about the quality of the craftsmanship of the homes the company builds. The consumer affairs website lists a pretty dismal rating for the company. The notion that volume home construction firms might build shoddy homes isn’t new. The build quality isn’t particularly relevant to the housing crash to be sure. The firm’s credit profile may be. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While the stock has lost 8.3% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why AAL Could Experience a TurnaroundThe RSI reading of 28.8 for AAL is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering AAL in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 6.1% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, AAL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

278,67caa14e-56da-3daf-94fa-759d830600e2,AAL,2023-04-15,American Airlines and Hertz Global have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-hertz-global-highlighted-122412116.html,1681475052,STORY,"['AAL', 'HTZ', 'PARR', 'SUN', 'SPGI', 'DNOW']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 14, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares American Airlines AAL as the Bull of the Day and Hertz Global HTZ as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NOW Inc. DNOW, Par Pacific Holdings PARR and Sunoco LP SUN.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The risk to reward is becoming favorable for American Airlines stock, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Furthermore, the Zacks Transportation-Airline Industry is in the top 13% of over 250 Zacks industries at the moment. Peak Travel Season Edging closer to the warmer months of the year, we are entering peak travel season and this should certainly give a boost to many airlines. There is also the possibility that travel will be higher in 2023 from lingering pent-up demand following the pandemic.In its latest data at the end of March, the U.S. Travel Associations' survey of travel spending totaled $93 billion in February which was 5% above 2019 pre-pandemic levels and 9% above 2022 levels.Plus, the Transportation Security Administrations' (TSA) checkpoint travel numbers have seen quite a few days spike above 2019 levels so far this month and are overall higher than last year.Earnings Estimate RevisionsIn correlation with the plausibility of higher travel demand, American Airlines' earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have now soared 32% over the last 90 days with FY24 EPS estimates rising 20%.American Airlines FY23 earnings are now forecasted to rebound and skyrocket 410% at $2.55 per share compared to EPS of $0.50 in 2022. Even better, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to climb another 24% at $3.16 per share.On the top line, sales are projected to jump 9% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 to $55.77 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would be 25% above 2019 pre-pandemic sales of $44.54 billion. This will certainly help the company's bottom line start to catch up as well.Story continuesAttractive Valuation Along with its post-pandemic growth recovery, American Airlines' valuation may be intriguing to investors right now with Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently announcing he will purchase a 51% stake in the company.News of Musk's majority interest in American Airlines surfaced at the beginning of the month. Although the Tesla boss jokingly stated he simply has an abundance of cash and likes buying companies with bird logos (Twitter) there is surely the factor of American Airlines price to earnings discount.American Airlines stock trades at just 5.1X forward earnings which is nicely beneath the industry average of 11.2X and the S&amp;P 500's 19X. Shares of AAL also trade 74% below their historical high of 21.1X since merging with U.S Airways in 2013. Plus, American Airlines stock trades at a 22% discount to its historic median of 6.9X.Bottom Line Now appears to be a great time to get in on American Airlines stock with earnings estimate revisions trending higher and shares still near 52-week lows at around $13 per share. The rising earnings estimates also make American Airlines P/E valuation very attractive and indicate its stock could indeed be vastly undervalued right now.It would be no surprise if American Airlines stock begins to fly this year with the Average Zacks Price Target suggesting 37% upside from current levels.Bear of the Day:Hertz Global currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with its Transportation-Services Industry in the bottom 15% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Investors may want to be cautious at the moment with Hertz not far removed from bankruptcy and facing increasing competition.Cautionary Tale Not that Hertz won't enjoy future success, but investors should be mindful that the company recently exited bankruptcy in July of 2021.After filing for Chapter 11, Hertz was delisted by the New York Stock Exchange in October 2020 but was relisted on the Nasdaq in November 2021. Hertz has a long history that dates back to 1918 with the company dominating the U.S. rental car industry for many years.However, the Covid-19 pandemic crippled the company as travel stopped and highlighted management's inability to preserve cash and an adequate balance sheet at the time. Compounding the challenges were Hertz's total liabilities which were at multi-year highs as shown in the nearby chart.Furthermore, with CFO Kenny Cheung recently leaving the company in late March there may be cause for concern. The company stated Cheung left for another professional opportunity in a different industry and has since appointed Chief Accounting Officer Alexandra Brooks as interim CFO.Growth &amp; CompetitionWhat also led to Hertz's trouble in recent years was increasing competition. After historically controlling the broader rental car industry, competitors like Avis Budget continued to expand while Hertz's shrank.Notably, Hertz's earnings estimate revisions have started to decline following its CFO's departure while Avis EPS estimates are rising. Hertz's earnings are now forecasted to drop -39% in fiscal 2023 at $2.27 per share compared to EPS of $3.74 in 2022. More concerning, fiscal 2024 EPS is expected to decline another -18%.Avis annual earnings are expected to experience a dip as well but the company's bottom line remains light years ahead of Hertz on top of CAR's earnings estimates soaring over the last quarter as shown in the chart below.This is indicative of Avis continuing to take market share. For now, Hertz declining earnings estimates may somewhat be symbolic of the company's inability to stop the bleeding.Bottom LineConsidering Hertz recently exited bankruptcy, the recent departure of its CFO may look like a red flag to many and investors will want to be cautious of HTZ stock as there could be more short-term weakness ahead.Reconfirming this possibility is the declining earnings estimates and Hertz's fall since relisting on the Nasdaq in 2021 could continue with shares of HTZ now down -40%.Additional content:U.S. Oil Prices Hit 2023 High: What's Driving the Market?U.S. oil prices moved up on Apr 12, hitting their highest level so far this year after government data showed a lower-than-expected weekly build in crude to go with the drop in gasoline and distillate supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures rose $1.73 (or 2.1%) to settle at $83.26 a barrel yesterday.Other factors driving the energy market are the recently announced surprise production cut by the OPEC+ cartel, hopes for an end to interest rate hikes following encouraging inflation data and potential refill to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (""SPR"") that could drain supplies.  Some oil-related stocks that could benefit in the current environment include NOW Inc., Par Pacific Holdings and Sunoco LP.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration's (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the holiday-shortened week ending Apr 7.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government's EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose 597,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 700,000-barrel increase per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of lower exports, higher production and a drop in refinery demand accounted for the stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer.Total domestic stocks now stand at 470.5 million barrels — 11.5% more than the year-ago figure and 3% higher than the five-year average.However, on a slightly bullish note, the latest report showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 409,000 barrels to 33.8 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover, at 30.2 days, remained unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 26.7 days.Let's turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the eighth time in as many weeks. The 330,000-barrel fall was primarily attributable to lower production. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would drop 900,000 barrels. At 222.2 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 4.7% less than the year-earlier level, while it is 7% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) dropped for the second week in succession. The 606,000-barrel decrease reflected lower production and a rise in exports. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of some 2 million barrels. Following last week's decline, current inventories — at 112.4 million barrels — are marginally below the year-ago level (by 0.9%) and 11% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 89.3%, edged down 0.3% from the prior week.Final WordEven as fears related to high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector over the past year. The space has generated a total return of around 12.1% in the trailing 12 months compared with the S&amp;P 500's decline of 6.9%.Apart from a relatively constructive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia's military operations in Ukraine. In March 2022, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Agreed, oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, However, the commodity still has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term, with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters' group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.While the banking sector turmoil did affect the sector temporarily, the crisis seems to have eased now. Crude also got a leg up and is now trading above $80 after U.S. Federal Reserve signaled an imminent end to interest rate increases, while the Biden Administration hinted at replenishing the SPR — a massive supply of government crude that is used in unforeseen circumstances — sometime this year.3 Stocks to BuyInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at NOW Inc., Par Pacific Holdings and Sunoco LP.

(NASDAQ:ORLY) and were rewarded last week after stock increased 3.1%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-control-86-oreilly-150152423.html,1681484512,STORY,['ORLY'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in O'Reilly Automotive implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 24 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have been selling lately Every investor in O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$55b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 24% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of O'Reilly Automotive, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About O'Reilly Automotive?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.O'Reilly Automotive already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see O'Reilly Automotive's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. O'Reilly Automotive is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.9% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of O'Reilly AutomotiveThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can see that insiders own shares in O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$572m. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in O'Reilly Automotive. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance.

Invariably, in this investing game, you’re going to pick a few clunkers – we all do. What separates successful players from those who consistently struggle often comes down to hard decision-making.Essentially, the concept of stocks to sell ranks similar to judging a talent show: some folks are talented, and most are not. And you just have to deliver the bad news rather than leading deluded hopefuls on. To add some objectivity to this unpleasant exercise, each of the names below incurred consensus analyst sell ratings.

In the five sessions ending April 6, BBBY stock suffered a steep loss of more than 43%. And that’s despite the fact that the company secured a $120 million merchandising lifeline. Basically, investors realize that the enterprise sits on borrowed time.Despite the deal with ReStore Capital, the fundamental problem for BBBY stock centers on trust (or lack thereof). Unlike its well-capitalized competitors, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond needs to put up cash to buy the inventory to stock its shelves. Otherwise, if the retailer goes under, the product suppliers would become unsecured creditors. However, the company’s balance sheet is simply awful. Unfortunately, management must concede to dilutive deals one after the other. Eventually, investors will lose hope.Story continuesTellingly, Wall Street analysts peg BBBY as a unanimous strong sell. Ignore the triple-digit price forecast as it’s merely residue from abandoned analyst targets. Instead, BBBY clearly ranks among the stocks to sell.Lumen Technologies (LUMN)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockAn American telecommunications company, Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) offers communications, network services, security, cloud solutions, voice and managed services. Per its public profile, the company also serves global enterprise customers across North America, Latin America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. While relevant, it’s struggled for traction.Fundamentally, Lumen will lose its spot on the S&amp;P 500 index. As well, the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates amid higher crude oil prices negatively affected investor sentiment. Financially, circumstances don’t look particularly auspicious for Lumen. For example, investment resource Gurufocus labels the enterprise a possible value trap.Specifically, the company’s Altman Z-Score sits at 0.23, indicating deep distress and thus, a high risk of bankruptcy. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 4.7% below breakeven. Not surprisingly, it also posts negative net margins. Naturally, analysts peg LUMN as a moderate sell. While their average price target of $3.81 implies nearly 57% upside, you can ignore it. Instead, LUMN ranks among the stocks to sell.Principal Financial Group (PFG)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockA global financial investment management and insurance firm, Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG) on paper offers myriad relevancies. However, the recent U.S. regional bank failures imposed many questions about the viability of the economy. Combined with other ongoing concerns such as the Fed’s monetary policy, PFG struggled this year. Since the January opener, shares dropped more than 12% in equity value.Financially, the company could use some work on its balance sheet. Notably, Principal’s equity-to-asset ratio sits at 0.03 times. However, the sector median value stands at 0.83 times. Therefore, Principal ranks worse than 97.68% of its peers. Operationally, the company features a modest three-year revenue growth rate of 5.9%. However, its free cash flow growth rate during the aforementioned period sits at 14.4% below parity. Therefore, PFG makes a “strong” case for stocks to sell. Finally, analysts peg PFG as a consensus moderate sell. The lowest price target is $58, implying 21% downside risk.Franklin Resources (BEN)earningsSource: ShutterstockWith the troubles that the regional banks – and even international finance giants – courted following the much-covered bank runs, it’s no surprise that Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) struggled for traction recently. Sure, since the Jan. opener, BEN stock lost only 2%. However, in the trailing month, it’s down more than 4%, possibly suggesting the beginning of a negative trend.Financially, more investors may be taking a closer look at its stability. Right now, the company’s equity-to-asset ratio is 0.4 times. Again, the median value for the asset management industry is 0.83 times. Also, Franklin’s debt-to-equity stands at 0.86 times. Here, the sector median comes in much lower at 0.23 times. To be fair, Franklin’s three-year revenue growth rate of 14.6% beats out 65.9% of the competition.Nevertheless, investors are taking an extremely cautious approach to the financial sector. Lastly, analysts peg BEN as a consensus moderate sell. Their average price target sits at $25.56, implying nearly 4% downside risk. Thus, it’s one of the stocks to sell.Expeditors International (EXPD)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Seattle, Washington, Expeditors International (NASDAQ:EXPD) is a worldwide logistics and freight forwarding company. Though carrying a significantly relevant profile, Expeditors’ problem centers on broader economic stability concerns. Further, fierce competition may play a more impactful role moving forward. Since the January opener, EXPD gained less than half a percent.As with the other stocks to sell on this list, analysts take a dim view overall on Expeditors. To be fair, the company so far prints decent financials. For example, it has a cash-to-debt ratio of 3.92, beating out 85.41% of its rivals. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 9.45 indicates a very low risk of bankruptcy.However, EXPD appears overvalued, especially against projected earnings. Also, EXPD trades at 5.23 times book value, ranked worse than nearly 92% of sector players. While it might not be on my personal sell list, analysts peg EXPD as a consensus moderate sell. Their average price target sits at $94.67, implying over 10% downside risk.Pinnacle West Capital (PNW)stocks to sell a group of businessmen holding their thumbs down. worst investments of 2020Source: ShutterstockAnother enterprise that caught analysts’ ire, Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) is a utility holding company that owns Arizona Public Service and Bright Canyon Energy. Generally speaking, I don’t mention utilities as stocks to sell because of their natural monopoly. Basically, the barrier to entry is so steep that would-be competitors give up before they even try. Sure enough, PNW gained almost 8% since the beginning of this year.Also, Pinnacle West’s financials don’t seem terrible, especially when stacked against other utility plays. To be sure, its balance sheet could use some work. Its Altman Z-Score pings at 0.85, indicating distress and a higher risk for bankruptcy. As well, the company’s FCF growth rate pings at 25.4% below breakeven.Further, Pinnacle doesn’t seem the greatest deal on paper. For instance, it seems noticeably overvalued against projected earnings. However, most analysts don’t like it. Among eight experts, three rate it a hold, and four rate it a sell. Additionally, the average price target is $71.88, implying 10.5% downside risk.Clorox (CLX)a businessman with his thumb facing downSource: ShutterstockTo be honest, I was shocked when I found out that Wall Street considers Clorox (NYSE:CLX) to be one of the stocks to sell. As a relevant consumer goods giant, Clorox theoretically brings value to those seeking a safe place to park their funds. At the same time, I can understand why the experts don’t like it. Fundamentally, with fading fears of the Covid-19 crisis, Clorox lost its cynical upside catalyst.Regarding its financials, Clorox doesn’t feature the worst profile I’ve seen. However, investors might be questioning its balance sheet. For example, the company’s cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.05 times, ranked worse than 87.71% of its competitors. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio is also 0.05 times, worse than 93.8% of sector players.Notably, both its EBITDA and FCF growth rate over the past three years have been sitting in negative territory. Also, the market prices CLX at a forward multiple of 29.24 times. That’s way overvalued compared to the rest of the industry (a median of 17.29 times). Finally, covering analysts peg CLX as a consensus moderate sell. Their price target sits at $139.11, implying nearly 12% downside risk.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Aflac (AFL), which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 3.72%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Aflac was expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share, but it reported $1.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.61%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.22 per share, while it actually produced $1.23 per share, a surprise of 0.82%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Aflac, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Aflac has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 26, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Think about the buzziest tech workplaces. What perks come to mind? Perhaps kombucha fountains and foosball tables. Now think about the corporate benefits of the past. What comes to mind? Perhaps an on-site fitness center or health care clinic. Maybe even an on-campus daycare center. For Aflac, these traditional benefits have been most helpful in attracting, retaining, and engaging new hires who value perks that create ease over splashiness.The insurance firm has also found that adding more benefits that require its 12,000-person workforce to come into the office to take advantage of them is, well, a great way to entice employees back to the office. It's a strategy that CHRO Matthew Owenby admits might sound ""old school"" to some. But the General Electric and Bank of America alum says it's helped to retain top talent and ramp up employee engagement.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: There's often a knowledge gap when it comes to benefits. How do you close that for employees?Matthew Owenby: HR people should do better. It's one thing for me to say, 'Hey, I've given you a benefits handbook, and I put it online, so my work is done here.' Wrong. Most people in the workplace spend less than 30 minutes a year determining what their benefits are going to be. They spend far more time searching for a vacation than they do on something that not only affects their financial stability but, in a post-COVID world, can be a financial exposure. It's the job of the HR organization to ensure that this is as important as getting your taxes right.You're missing the point if you're waiting for annual enrollment in September to talk about benefits. And you're also not allowing yourself as an employer to use the benefits as another reason to retain your employee base.Story continuesWhat's worked for you at Aflac?We communicate to people where they are and how they want to be communicated to. We have Aflac pages for employees on social media. We also offer monthly benefits town halls, meetings, and webcasts. And we highlight elements of benefit offerings on the intranet quarterly. We ingrain it into how we operate, so it's not just once a year.Number two, we are huge on physical interaction, which I know might seem old-fashioned. We have people within the HR department who will meet with employees and talk about their benefits needs, as well as our existing benefits.What benefits have seen the greatest jump in adoption lately? Mental health support is exploding in popularity. We found in our survey that 80% of employees believe their employers should offer mental health coverage, but only about 60% actually have access to this benefit.The second thing is wellness benefits in general, offerings like an on-campus gym, diet, life coaching, etc. We are fortunate to have on-site gyms—I know that’s old-fashioned. We are also fortunate to have on-site health care. Also old fashioned. You probably see the pattern here.Some of those things of the past make dramatically great differences in employee experience and outcomes. We have so many stories of someone not feeling well who dropped by the health clinic before work, and we prevented a heart attack or diabetic coma. Walking into the building, you pass a fully staffed health care unit with doctors to get what you need. And now we have mental health care professionals on-site as well.Have you seen more employees return to in-person work at Aflac’s offices to take advantage of these services?Absolutely. We are particularly interested in being an employer of choice for women, and having on-site childcare enables us to accomplish a portion of our strategy there. Again, this is kind of old-fashioned.Before the turn of the previous century, employers cared for their employees primarily because the social systems did not exist, but it was also just good business.Think about the war on talent and the Great Resignation. We didn't have a Great Resignation at Aflac, and you can't easily replicate this experience in any other place from an HR perspective. If we take care of our employees, they will take care of our customers and the business.Amber Burtonamber.burton@fortune.com@amberbburtonThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Sherwin-Williams' (NYSE:SHW) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Sherwin-Williams, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$3.0b ÷ (US$23b - US$6.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Sherwin-Williams has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Chemicals industry. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sherwin-Williams compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Sherwin-Williams here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsSherwin-Williams has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 67% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Our Take On Sherwin-Williams' ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Sherwin-Williams has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And with a respectable 80% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Sherwin-Williams can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesOne final note, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Sherwin-Williams (including 1 which is concerning) .While Sherwin-Williams isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The company will replace old six-inch water lines installed in the 1930s with new eight- and 12-inch ductile iron mains.New Jersey American Water makes regular investments in upgrading and maintaining its pipelines and other infrastructure. These upgrades allow the company to efficiently serve its customers.Aging Infrastructure of Water IndustryA substantial portion of the U.S. water and wastewater infrastructure has aged and is nearing the end of its effective service life. Miles of aging pipelines require repairs and upgrades to provide and maintain quality water service. A delay in repair could cause frequent disruptions in the 24x7 supply of potable water and sewer services.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructures, like storage tanks and purifying units, need maintenance at proper intervals.Utilities Making Systematic InvestmentGiven the above-mentioned scenario, it is evident that systematic investments to upgrade and maintain the existing infrastructure and provisions for adding new infrastructure will assist operators in meeting the rising customer demand. Water utilities are making systematic investments to replace and upgrade their aging infrastructure. The U.S. government is also providing funds to upgrade and maintain the same.American Water Works aims to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion for the 10-year period of 2023-2032.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -59.8%.Revenues are expected to be $5.33 billion, down 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.03% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Freeport-McMoRan?For Freeport-McMoRan, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.83%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Freeport-McMoRan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Freeport-McMoRan would post earnings of $0.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering a surprise of +30%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Freeport-McMoRan appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

292,a4997cd9-8b9f-346b-b860-ee550251e45e,FCX,2023-04-15,Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-fcx-trending-130001114.html,1681477201,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this mining company have returned +19% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has gained 11.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.43 per share, indicating a change of -59.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -16.4%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.41 indicates a change of +17.9% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Freeport-McMoRan is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.33 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -19.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.3 billion and $24.1 billion estimates indicate +2.3% and +3.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.6%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.81%. The EPS surprise was +30%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

294,b688b937-71bf-3cb7-aa21-ed34dd60eff1,PEP,2023-04-15,"PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 74% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-largely-110046617.html,1681556446,STORY,['PEP'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in PepsiCo implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 41% of the company Insiders have been selling lately If you want to know who really controls PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of PepsiCo, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PepsiCo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in PepsiCo. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PepsiCo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in PepsiCo. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that PepsiCo, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$416m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - PepsiCo has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP).PepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PEPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PepsiCo here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PepsiCo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PEP Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.23.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:19% = US$4.3b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.19 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo begin with, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 21%. This certainly adds some context to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' exceptional 32% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 35% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is REGN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether REGN is currently mispriced by the market.Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

The episode then explores two giants of key industries—Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Union Pacific (UNP)—that are sitting at beaten-down levels heading into earnings that might make them attractive to long-term investors.The next several weeks are likely to prove pivotal for the stock market since a lot is riding on corporate earnings outlooks holding steady. Outside of earnings, Wall Street appears to like what it saw from the March CPI and PPI data. Inflation is clearly cooling from its summer peaks. Investors are pricing in that the Fed is nearly done with rate hikes and will start pivoting to a more dovish tone by the end of 2023.Stocks were down through late-afternoon trading on Friday after the market surged higher on Thursday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq remain well above their 50-day moving averages as JPMorgan, Citi, and others unofficially kicked off second quarter earnings season.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the resurgence, the S&amp;P 500 still trades 15% below its highs and not too far above its 10-year median in terms of forward earnings. The market is, however, looking a little overheated, especially in certain pockets and specific stocks.Investors might instead want to search for long-term value via great, proven companies trading at very attractive levels in terms of price and value. It is always worth remembering that some of the best times to buy great stocks is when other people seemingly don’t want them for various short-term reasons, and then sell some when everyone craves them again.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is set to report its first quarter 2023 earnings on Thursday, April 20. TSM is the world’s largest chip manufacturer and it is expanding its footprint outside of Taiwan in the U.S. Taiwan Semi is working on rolling out next-gen, 3-nanometer transistors as chip firms race to improve speedsStory continuesTaiwan Semi stands to benefit for decades to come from the never-ending tech revolution that’s fueled by chips. TSM, which grabs a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, is trading around 40% from its highs as Wall Street worries about tensions between the U.S. and China. In the long-term, TSM will likely prove too valuable to both economic giants for either to negatively impact TSM's crucial chip production.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTSM’s valuation is fantastic, with it trading at a 55% discount to own highs at 14.9X forward 12-month earnings. Alongside its valuation and upside, TSM’s dividend yields around 1.6% at the moment and it boasts a strong balance sheet. Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) is also set to report first quarter 2023 financial results on April 20. Union Pacific is a rail freight titan that’s a rather straightforward long-term play into the wider world of transportation and shipping. And it seems highly unlikely that railroad shipping goes out of style no matter what the economy or energy infrastructure looks like 50 or even 100 years from now.UNP and the wider group ofrailroad operators have subdued outlooks for 2023 as they brace for a slowdown in demand. Union Pacific also announced in late February that its CEO would be stepping down amid a push to shake things up and encourage UNP to boost its operations and profits.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnion Pacific has paid a dividend for 124 years in a row and it has raised its payout by 12% annualized over the past five years. UNP has crushed the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years, up 1,300% vs. 350%.
