It has amassed assets over $6.47 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap ValueSitting at a market capitalization below $2 billion, small cap companies tend to be high-potential stocks compared to its large and mid cap counterparts, but come with higher risk.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.58%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 21.40% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) accounts for about 0.63% of total assets, followed by Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) and Visteon Corp (VC).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 3.19% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskFNDA seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.The ETF has added roughly 5.04% so far this year and is up about 13.68% in the last one year (as of 09/26/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.52 and $53.63.The ETF has a beta of 1.21 and standard deviation of 22.39% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 1001 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, FNDA is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $10.52 billion in assets, Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF has $23.99 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.24% and VBR charges 0.07%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

State Street slashed fees on ten SPDR ETFs in August, including that high-yield bond product.""Investors continue to consistently rank the expense ratio at the top of the list of the factors they consider most important in owning an ETF,"" said David Botset, managing director of equity product management and innovation at Schwab.Still, there's a limit to how low fees can go.""As we get into the low single digits, it's getting more challenging,"" Bostet added. U.S. equity ETFs that 10 or 15 years ago cost an investor as much as 0.50% to own now have fees of a tenth of that, or even less, he said.Schwab doesn't want these low-cost ETFs to end up as loss leaders for the company's array of asset management products, Bostet said. ""We're confident we can still achieve a level of profitability"" from scale, recouping in volume what is lost on pricing.Schwab has nearly $300 billion in ETF assets under management, out of more than $920 billion managed by Schwab Asset Management overall.(Reporting by Suzanne McGee; Editing by Sonali Paul)]"

(NYSE:AYI) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-165-time-put-acuity-142947529.html,1695652187,STORY,['AYI'],"[While Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it maintained its current share price over the past couple of month on the NYSE, with a relatively tight range of US$157 to US$169. However, does this price actually reflect the true value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Acuity Brands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Acuity Brands Is Acuity Brands Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Acuity Brands is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $230.38, but it is currently trading at US$165 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Acuity Brands’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Acuity Brands?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Acuity Brands, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -4.7%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although AYI is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to AYI, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AYI for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Acuity Brands at this point in time.

The company reported a Loss Per Share of $0.17. This article aims to answer the question: Is Qorvo's stock modestly undervalued? The following analysis will shed light on QRVO's valuation, inviting readers to delve into the company's financials and market performance.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with QRVO. Click here to check it out. QRVO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of QRVOQorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO) is the combined entity of RF Micro Devices and TriQuint Semiconductor, merging in January 2015. The company specializes in radio frequency filters, power amplifiers, and front-end modules used in many of the world's most advanced smartphones. Qorvo also has a suite of products sold into a variety of non-smartphone end markets, such as wireless base stations, cable TV and networking equipment, infrastructure, and military applications. The company's stock price currently stands at $96.29, while the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $108.57.Unveiling Qorvo (QRVO)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Based on the GF Value calculation, Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) stock is estimated to be modestly undervalued. With a market cap of $9.40 billion at its current price per share, Qorvo's future return is likely to be higher than its business growth due to its relatively undervalued status.Story continuesUnveiling Qorvo (QRVO)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus, it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. Qorvo has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.36, which is worse than 82.74% of 904 companies in the Semiconductors industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Qorvo at 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Qorvo is fair.Unveiling Qorvo (QRVO)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent  profitability  over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Qorvo has been profitable 7 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $3.20 billion and Loss Per Share of $0.17. Its operating margin is 1.04%, which ranks worse than 67.02% of 952 companies in the Semiconductors industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Qorvo at 7 out of 10, which indicates fair profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Qorvo is 8.5%, which ranks worse than 58.94% of 872 companies in the Semiconductors industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -12.7%, which ranks worse than 87.1% of 775 companies in the Semiconductors industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Qorvo's ROIC was 0.83, while its WACC came in at 11.12.Unveiling Qorvo (QRVO)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

However, recent volatility around interest rates and inflation could make certain stocks untenable as near- and medium-term investments. In particular, as the chip glut continues, semiconductor stocks have been showing signs of weakness and distress that investors should be wary of. Below are three semiconductor stocks to sell, as they have been waving massive red flags recently.Micron Technology (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comWhile Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the world’s largest producers of memory chips, it is also one of the top options of semiconductor stocks to sell, in my opinion.Unfortunately, Micron business has suffered tremendously during the current economic cycle. In particular, the memory producer has had to endure falling prices and oversupply in the memory market, which have severely eroded its quarterly margins and profitability. In its latest quarterly report, Micron reported a 56.5% year-over-year decline in revenue and a 173.9% drop in earnings per share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe company’s recovery from these record losses is, in essence, contingent upon consumers pouring back into consumer electronics. Because inflation remains pervasive globally, it is difficult to say when consumers will do so again. Many analysts are predicting interest rates to remain higher than what was initially predicted. A period of higher rates will not bode well for consumers or Micron.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading wireless technology and semiconductors business I have written positively about in the past, primarily citing its relatively cheap valuation and successful foray into 5G. Recent news that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will continue to use Qualcomm’s wireless modems at least until 2026 should provide cause for further optimism. However, events in China have made me feel that this is one of the semiconductor stocks to sell.Story continuesEarly this month, Huawei – the telecom, cloud and consumer electronics champion of China – quietly released the Huawei Mate 60 Pro which features a 7-nanometer system on a chip (SoC) designed and manufactured in China. Although the die size is technically a few generations behind what the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is capable of manufacturing, this represented a surprising breakthrough for the world’s second largest economy.However, the news spells a potential disaster for Qualcomm. The American semiconductor company supplies SoCs and wireless technology to many smartphones. Given Huawei has shown it can make a smartphone primarily composed of semiconductor parts sourced domestically while also exhibiting fast wireless speeds matching those of Apple’s own products, other Chinese smartphone OEMs, including OPPO and Xiaomi, could abandon Qualcomm’s products instead preferring domestically produced semiconductor devices, whether under their own volition or incentives from the government.The bottom-line is, although Qualcomm has a potential opportunity with Apple, the company’s long-term, global growth prospects are cloudy, especially in its smartphone segment. As China marches on to be less reliant on the Western technology ecosystem, Qualcomm has a lot to lose in the years to come.Qorvo (QRVO)The logo for Qorvo (QRVO) is shown on a sign outside the company's headquarters.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) is a provider of radio frequency (RF) solutions for wireless communications, such as filters, amplifiers, switches and antennas. The company serves a diverse range of markets, including smartphones, wireless infrastructure, defense, aerospace and Internet of Things (IoT). However, Qorvo has been facing headwinds from the slowdown in its key end-markets, especially for wireless products destined for smartphones, where it derives a large portion of its revenue. Qorvo has also been negatively affected by the slowing global economy and foreboding macroeconomic outlook. Similar to Micron Technology, Qorvo is susceptible to low consumer demand for electronics because its customers, which include Apple, purchase Qorvo wireless devices to enable wireless connectivity in smartphones, tablets and smart IoT devices. In its fiscal year 2023 report (ended in April), Qorvo reported a 23.1% year-over-year decline in revenue and an 89.2% year-over-year decline in earnings per share. The decline in top-line growth continued into Q1 2024. These successive factors lead me to think Qorvo is probably not the best bet in the current macroeconomic environment.On the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This time too, investors’ focus will center around comparable store sales, the key metric to gauge the company’s performance.Insights Into Comparable SalesBefore delving into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, let's revisit the third quarter.In the last reported quarter, Costco's comparable sales performance displayed a diverse picture across regions. The United States witnessed a slight drop of 0.1% in comparable sales, while Canada experienced a somewhat larger decline of 1%. In contrast, Costco's performance in Other International locations was robust, with a significant increase of 4.1%. Overall, the company managed to achieve modest growth of 0.3% in comparable sales.As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, it's important to consider the various factors influencing Costco's performance, including consumer spending trends and the ongoing impact of inflation. Costco's decision to discontinue charter shipping activities is aimed at taking advantage of lower shipping market rates and passing on savings to its members. Additionally, strong renewal rates and membership growth are likely to have contributed to sales.For the quarter in focus, we anticipate an impressive 7.9% jump in net sales and a notable 6.1% increase in total membership fees. Costco's paid membership base has been on a steady ascent, driven by a growing customer base and remarkable renewal rates. We also project 0.7% growth in comparable sales for the fourth quarter.A customer-centric approach, strategic pricing, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on memberships are likely to have contributed to Costco’s overall performance.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCostco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCostco Wholesale Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteStory continuesHow Are Estimates Shaping Up?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $78,563 million, indicating an increase of 9% from the prior-year reported figure.

11,83f99a53-69b1-38cb-a590-355d118dd079,MMC,2023-09-26,US employers plan more modest compensation increases in 2024,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-employers-plan-more-modest-132800063.html,1695648480,STORY,['MMC'],"[NEW YORK, September 25, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Mercer, a global leader in redefining the world of work, reshaping retirement and investment outcomes, and unlocking real health and well-being, and a business of Marsh McLennan (NYSE: MMC), released the results of its August 2023 Mercer QuickPulse™ US Compensation Planning Survey. According to the survey, employers in the US plan to raise their compensation budgets by 3.5% for merit increases for 2024 and 3.9% for their total salary increase budgets for non-unionized employees. This compares to actual merit increases of 3.8% and 4.1% for total salary increase budgets for non-unionized employees in 2023.i""While preliminary compensation budgets for 2024 are showing a slight decline, they remain well above pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the ongoing tightness of the labor market and low levels of unemployment. However, if the labor market continues to stabilize and inflation cools further as we move towards the end of the year, compensation pressures are likely to continue to decline. This could prompt further reductions in 2024 compensation increase budgets, as employers adjust their strategies to reflect the changing economic landscape,"" said Lauren Mason, Senior Principal, Career, Mercer.Across industries, Healthcare Services are projecting 2024 budgets that lag other industries, with merit budgets of 3.1% and total increase budgets of 3.4%, as the industry continues to recover from the financial impact of the pandemic. Recent layoffs and financial strain on the high-tech industry also appear to be impacting merit budgets, with projected increases of 3.3%, a reversal of historical trends where high-tech typically led increases across industries. Several industries, including Energy and Consumer Goods, are planning merit budgets above the national average, projecting an increase of 3.7%.The survey also found that employers are planning to promote less (8.7% of the employee population) and therefore will allocate less of their budget (1.1%) to promotional increases in 2024. In 2023, employers reported that they promoted 10.3% of their population, allocating 1.2% of their salary budget to do so.Story continuesLooking back at actual compensation increases over the last year, employer base salary levels increased 5.6%ii on average, despite 2023 merit increase budgets of 3.8%. This is a result of off-cycle pay increases which 59% of employers reported providing in 2023. The top reasons cited for off-cycle increases were to address retention concerns, counteroffers, market adjustments, and internal equity.Ms. Mason continued, ""As employers plan for 2024, it is crucial that they move away from the reactive approach of the past few years and adopt a more strategic approach. This will enable employers to focus their compensation investments on the most critical attraction and retention segments of their workforce, while also ensuring that pay increases are distributed fairly and equitably.""Note to editors:Total increase budgets include other base pay increases such as promotional pay increases and cost of living adjustments, in addition to merit increases.About Mercer’s US Compensation Planning SurveyThe August 2023 Mercer QuickPulse™ US Compensation Planning Survey includes data from more than 900 organizations in the US, from small employee bases (less than 500 employees) to very large employee bases (over 20,000 employees) across 15 industries.

Total increase budgets include merit increases along with other base pay increases such as promotional pay increases and cost of living adjustments. Although Canada still has an extremely tight labour market, indices show that the market is stabilizing. As a result, the use of pay increases to respond to labour market pressures has slowed down.""In the face of economic uncertainty and reduced labour market pressure, employer compensation budgets seem to be returning to pre-pandemic levels,"" said Elizabeth English, Principal in Mercer Canada's Career Products business. ""If Canada's labour market continues to cool over the next few months, it could reduce pressure on 2024 compensation budgets even further.""The survey also highlights how pay transparency is an emerging priority for Canadian employers. British Columbia is one of the first provinces to have passed pay transparency legislation requiring employers to post salary ranges on publicly advertised job postings. The legislation goes into effect November 1, 2023.The survey found that many Canadian employers overall are taking a less proactive approach, with only 30% agreeing they should have embedded transparency as part of their reward and talent philosophies. What's more, 51% of employers have no plans to go further with pay transparency than required by local law. However, over the last year, the number of Canadian companies who report that they share salary ranges in job postings has nearly doubled, from 8% to 15%.Story continues""Pay transparency legislation continues to push employers to fast forward their policies,"" added English. ""Proactive action will not only help employers get ahead of future legislation, but pay transparency promotes a culture of trust, increases employee perceptions of fair play, is critical in attracting candidates, and ultimately drives higher levels of commitment and engagement.""Mercer's Compensation Planning Survey includes data from more than 500 organizations of varying sizes across 15 industries.

The law firms behind these suits are Stranch, Jennings&amp;Garvey, PLLC, and Kopelowitz Ostrow Ferguson Weiselberg Gilbert.The lawsuits allege that the companies did not adequately disclose the breaches, leaving customers unaware of potential future vulnerabilities related to the theft of their personal information. It is believed by victims that their data has been sold on the dark web. The suits highlight that personal identifiable information (PII) retains high value among criminals, with prices ranging from $40 to $200 for stolen identity credentials on the dark web.A fifth lawsuit was filed against Caesars Entertainment on Friday by The O’Mara Law Firm, P.C, of Reno, and Barnow and Associates, P.C., of Chicago. This lawsuit represents Thomas McNicholas and Laura McNicholas, an Illinois couple who have been members of the Caesars Rewards Program for over 20 years. This suit alleges a breach of contract with every customer whose personal data was stolen in the breach.All five lawsuits demand monetary damages for victims — actual, statutory and punitive damages, as well as restitution. They also seek any profits the companies obtained through using the compromised data and assurances that such breaches will not occur again. The lawsuits allege negligence, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment, and all are seeking a jury trial.Story continuesIn addition to these five lawsuits, a sixth similar suit was brought against both MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment in the New Jersey district court on September 18.

The suit, filed on Friday, September 22, 2023, alleges negligence on the part of MGM for failing to maintain adequate measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of customers' data.The cyberattack began on September 7, 2023, when hackers impersonated an IT admin and gained access credentials. The attack led to a lockdown of MGM's network, preventing resort guests from using their electronic room cards, Wi-Fi, ATM kiosks, electronic gaming devices, and other resort services. Two cybercriminal organizations, ""The Scatter Spider"" and ALPHV, have claimed responsibility for the attack.The class action was brought forward by Emily Kirwan on behalf of herself and other members of MGM's loyalty program affected by the cyberattack. According to the lawsuit, MGM exposed full names, dates of birth, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and/or driver’s license numbers due to negligence and failure to follow “adequate and reasonable” procedures and policies regarding the encryption of data.In addition to the data breach, MGM's operations were severely impacted. The company's reservation systems were compromised which led to long lines in most of the lobbies at MGM properties as employees had to do much of the work manually. Normal operations were reinstated after a ten-day computer shutdown.On Monday last week (September 18), MGM announced it had managed to get most of its computers back online after suffering a ransomware cyberattack. However, there are many unknown factors about the cyberattack that pose significant risks to investors. Analysts have estimated daily losses in revenue but increased costs have not yet been reported. The liability in the data loss is unknown, and the terms and amount of insurance coverage for cyberattacks are also unknown.Story continuesMGM Resorts International does have an impressive recent record of buybacks, reducing the share count from nearly 500 million to just over 350 million over the last three years. However, the tangible book value of MGM is -$6.65 per share, and they're carrying more than $19 of debt per share. Their earnings history is not impressive, showing a general upward trend but nothing significant, and that's before factoring in the current situation.The company has yet to estimate the increased labor costs incurred due to the cyberattack. However, MGM Resorts International does maintain insurance against cyberattacks according to their most recent 10-K filing. The extent of their coverage remains unknown at this time.The class action suit follows another similar lawsuit targeting fellow Vegas Strip heavyweight Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment for a similar cyberattack.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Set to Break Two Significant Streaks With Upcoming Fiscal Third-Quarter Results,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carnival-corp-set-break-two-102426243.html,1695637466,STORY,"['CCL', 'CUK', 'NCLH', 'RCL']","[Monday, September 25, 2023 - Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp., the largest cruise line operator globally, is set to announce its fiscal third-quarter results this Friday, anticipated to mark the end of two significant trends for the company.For 14 quarters in a row, dating back to the last quarter of fiscal 2019, Carnival reported losses due to the severe impact of COVID-19 on the cruise industry and international travel restrictions that limited access to global ports. This led to a substantial revenue drop, resulting in a loss of $9.5 billion in fiscal 2021, slightly less than the $10.2 billion loss from the previous year.To stay solvent during this period, Carnival, along with smaller competitors Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), issued new stock at low prices during their operational downtime, leading to a significant increase in share count. They also heavily relied on financing, which resulted in Carnival's debt tripling and Royal Caribbean's and Norwegian Cruise Line's debt roughly doubling.However, these companies are now witnessing a return to profitability. Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line posted profits for their second quarter ending in June. Though Carnival reported a net loss for its fiscal second quarter ending in May, all 13 major analysts providing earnings estimates predict that the company will report positive net income this Friday. Predictions range from a per-share profit of $0.70 to $0.84, with a consensus average of $0.75.Another trend expected to end with this week's report is Carnival's eight-quarter streak of more than doubling its year-over-year growth. Analysts predict a sharp deceleration in growth, with a 37% increase to reach $6.7 billion for the quarter ending last month.This deceleration is not seen as a concern by industry experts. After the cruise industry was halted in spring 2020, year-over-year comparisons were favorable heading into the second half of fiscal 2021. Now, as Carnival and its peers are back in operation, Carnival is forecasted to achieve record revenue by the end of fiscal 2023.Story continuesFurthermore, Carnival's future bookings reached a record high in the previous quarter, with customer deposits for these sailings totaling $7.2 billion, $1.2 billion more than its previous record for a quarter's end. While some travel sectors experienced sluggishness this summer, cruise lines have been late entrants to the rebound travel market. The company's guidance on Friday will determine its stock direction, but the fiscal third quarter should demonstrate a solid performance, marking an end to two long streaks at Carnival.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Daco, the chief economist at EY and a frequent guest on Yahoo Finance Live, said the autoworkers strike, a government shutdown, and resumption of student loan payments could together create a “significant drag on growth in the fourth quarter.”Now, there’s a new threat to contend with: Oil prices have soared by around $20 a barrel in the past six months. That means prices at the pump are about 20% higher now than they were at the beginning of the year, according to AAA.But fret not, say some analysts and economists. While higher oil prices could indeed trim GDP, it’s a “manageable headwind.” That’s the framing from the economics team over at Goldman Sachs, which is cutting its fourth quarter growth forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 0.7%.JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli says the pain could be a bit more acute, trimming GDP growth by half a percentage point annualized, but wouldn't be ""large enough to threaten the expansion by itself.""Goldman’s Jan Hatzius &amp; Co. (this particular note is credited to Spencer Hill) put the oil price rise into perspective, comparing it to bigger spikes in 2008 and 2022.These spikes may be big, but still out of the danger zone. In a note from DataTrek, hedge fund veteran Nicholas Colas wrote that the price would have to double before it would really cause a problem.“History shows they must double in a year or less before a recession is inevitable. That makes the warning track $140/barrel,"" Colas wrote, adding that history says that ""oil price spikes matter much more than modestly rising prices.""Of course, nothing exists in a vacuum, and oil prices have gone up in tandem with Daco’s other threats rearing their heads. As my colleague Brian Sozzi points out, citing RBC’s Lori Calvasina, markets don’t react well to government shutdowns, an event that could happen next week.Story continuesAs for the other threats, economists have largely gamed out the hits to economic growth from the auto strike and student loan repayments.There are a lot of modest headwinds, and one way to look at them is that they could also add up. The oil supply cuts, JPM noted, could ""interact with a combination of other modest negative US shocks"" like ""an escalation of the UAW strike, a government shutdown or the recent rise in US long-term interest rates.""Macro effects aside, the higher oil prices do prompt a lingering question for investors: Which companies will be most affected? One answer to that question came today in the form of Jefferies downgrading Nike to Hold, citing the impact from student loans.“Most US consumers with student debt are concerned about meeting all their monthly expenses (87%) and that apparel/accessories and footwear are likely to be areas of reduced spending ahead,” wrote analyst Randal Konik.Presumably, those monthly expenses also include the price of gas.morning brief imageClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
24,a411da2a-afa5-308e-8195-2aef75653d93,O,2023-09-26,Why Now Could Be a Good Time to Invest in Oil and Gas,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-now-could-good-time-094035322.html,1695721235,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F']","[Demand for energy is strong and supply has gotten low, and while clean energy is making strides, it’ll take a while before it dominates. Here are three ways to invest in oil and gas.With all due respect to Charles Dickens, the oil and gas sector is increasingly a tale of two markets. Depending on where you focus, it is the best of times, and it is the worst of times.For the past few years, professionals in the oil and gas industry have expressed their dissatisfaction with the state of the sector. The use of oil and gas has diminished, and prices have proven volatile due to the global slowdown caused by COVID-19.The world economy has somewhat recovered, resulting in a banner year for oil majors in 2022. However, fears of an imminent recession coupled with stagnant natural gas prices, rising costs of production and a particularly acute economic slowdown in China have restrained any palpable sense of optimism for some.Not to mention…ESG carries the day. The fossil fuel industry is under sharp focus due to the rise of prominence in ESG (environmental, social and governance) standards. ESG advocates have already achieved substantial progress toward their overall goal to get pensions, banks, insurance companies and endowments not only to shed their existing holdings in public oil equities, but also to shun new investments in drilling and exploration. The ESG movement has successfully shifted growth from fossil fuels to renewables, as we will explore shortly.Inflation marches on. Exploration of new oil and gas fields has become more expensive due to external factors like inflation, resulting in rising costs. Inflation numbers are certainly trending in a more optimistic direction than they have been over the last two years, but there is only talk of “pausing” interest rate increases in the U.S., not of stopping them entirely or even reversing them.The world is an unstable place. Furthermore, the industry has faced an additional challenge due to geopolitical uncertainties. The war in Ukraine plods on, disrupting oil and gas supplies from Russia, resulting in higher prices in the European nations that rely on Russia for a significant portion of their energy.Story continuesSince China is the world’s second-largest consumer of oil and gas, its economic struggles continue to dampen demand and present significant impacts on the global oil and gas market. And across the globe, concerns about climate change have resulted in significant regulatory barriers for fossil fuels and increased subsidization of the clean energy industry poised to at least partially replace them.Now seems the perfect time to reconsider Warren Buffett's advice to be greedy when others are fearful. Fear is clearly carrying the day in the oil and gas industry. However, let's examine what reasons might exist for investing in oil and gas.Reasons for investing in oil and gas1. Demand for energy is strong and getting stronger.The world may one day be headed toward a future where electric cars replace conventional ones, biomass heating replaces traditional heating, and coal usage is eliminated, but this transition will not occur overnight.Even if car companies make good on their pledge to produce only electric vehicles by 2035, it will take decades to transition away from fossil fuels. And by all accounts, the demand for energy is growing by the day.The world's energy may be getting cleaner, but it is not yet entirely clean. Despite the world's wishes, it will still require a significant amount of oil and gas for the foreseeable future, which presents an issue, because...2. The supply of energy is low and will take a while to recover.As previously mentioned, the rising costs and falling prices are discouraging the industry from investing heavily in drilling. Although the market hasn't shown it yet, the decreasing oil and gas supply will pose problems in meeting global energy demands. No amount of wishful thinking about green energy replacing fossil fuels will address this situation in the short term, regardless of the long-term future of renewables.3. The law of economics remains intact.Put simply, an increase in demand for a limited commodity does not necessarily mean the end of the oil and gas industry, despite the desires of ESG advocates.In his recent white paper on the future of energy, John Mauldin, a noted financial expert, economist and visionary thinker, pointed out that the ESG movement unintentionally reduced energy supply, leading to spiking energy prices in the face of increasing demand. However, no responsible country is likely to advocate against their citizens’ needs for power and clean water, both of which require oil and gas, making a compelling case for medium- and long-term energy prices.Add it all up, and opportunity may be knockingSo the oil and gas sector appears to be ripe for new investment. Now comes the tricky part: How best to invest in this opportunity?Generally speaking, most oil and gas investors tend to confine themselves to traditional energy investments in the stock market, buying shares in integrated oil companies like Fortune 500 stalwarts ExxonMobil and Chevron, or in MLPs that store and transport oil and gas to refineries. These stocks tend to be conservative, reliable dividend payers and can certainly reward patient investors over the long run, particularly if the shares are bought in an IRA or other tax-sheltered investment.And while there’s nothing wrong with that approach for most people, sophisticated investors would do well to take a close look at three ways to invest in the oil and gas sector. All three investments take into account three universal truths of investing:First, the ideal investment minimizes risk while maximizing returnSecond, the ideal investment does not exist, and our goal is simply to come as close as possible to that idealThird, taxes are the silent killer of any investment and should always be in the crosshairs of any investment philosophy, including these three timely and tantalizing oil and gas investmentsThree ways to invest in the oil and gas sector1. Mineral rightsRecall John Mauldin’s observation that the ESG movement appears to be succeeding in reducing supply exactly as demand continues to increase. Nowhere is this phenomenon more evident than as we examine mineral rights, a concept on the lower end of the risk spectrum of the three ideas I am outlining.Historically, generational wealth has been created through mineral rights, which involves the ownership and subsequent leasing of land to oil and gas drillers and operators, who develop and produce wells. Landowners thus have a royalty interest in the land, but no responsibility to undertake its development directly.Some of the institutions and funds that have been owners of these rights for decades are now under pressure to comply with ESG-friendly board members to divest of as much as possible of their hydrocarbon-based assets. These assets include land located in some of the most energy-rich basins in the country. As these funds sell some of their best-performing assets, mineral rights funds are perfectly positioned to scoop them up, building their portfolios with timely purchases that are likely to increase in value over the next several years.Mineral rights funds have tremendous appeal to savvy oil and gas investors with an approximately five- or six-year time horizon. They are capable of producing instant cash flow, which is likely to increase over time as the number of productive wells within the fund increases, with a goal of double-digit cash flows. There is also tremendous capacity for capital gains, as most funds operate with the goal of developing their properties and ultimately selling them to generate further returns.Finally, because mineral rights are investment properties that are eligible for 1031 exchanges, which can shield investment returns from capital gains taxes indefinitely when properly structured, the funds may well be eligible for preferred tax treatment, either on the way in or the way out… or both. It’s important to note that investors can use a 1031 exchange to move funds from a realized investment gain into a mineral rights fund, but they are not required to do so; mineral funds can be purchased with cash as well as through a 1031 exchange.2. Oil and gas drilling fundsFor investors who are less concerned with income and more interested in potential tax benefits as a precursor to possibly larger capital gains, drilling funds might provide an excellent opportunity.Drilling funds can provide a massive tax advantage on the front end of the investment, with a tax write-off of up to 80% to 90% of the value of the investment.The deduction, which is actually for the intangible drilling costs, or IDCs, represents the cost of exploring and drilling oil and gas wells, which are deducted in the year they are incurred. IDC deductions offset ordinary income, so that a $300,000 investment in a drilling fund might enable an investor to lower their taxable income by as much as $270,000 in the year the investment is made.In addition, subsequent depletion allowances permit investors to deduct a portion of the value of their oil and gas reserves each year, even if they do not sell any oil and gas. The amount of the deduction is based on the type of the property, the production level and the cost of the property. This could be as high as 15% of the gross income from the property, though the amount is impacted by both the taxable mineral income from the property as well as the taxpayer’s overall gross income. Depletion allowances are phased out based on gross income, so the input of a qualified tax adviser is essential.3. Qualified opportunity funds in the energy sectorA qualified opportunity fund (QOF) investment addresses one of investors’ primary concerns (capital gains taxes) without sacrificing its focus on the other (investment returns). By using a realized gain to fund a QOF investment, investors can defer the tax on that gain until Dec. 31, 2026. More important, they can avoid paying taxes on the QOF investment itself simply by holding it for a minimum of 10 years. The ability to defer a current gain and avoid a future one entirely represents a generational opportunity that higher-net-worth investors should take seriously.By selecting an investment in one of the many QOFs that are located in areas of the country that specialize in energy exploration and production, savvy oil and gas investors can position themselves to take advantage of the outstanding 10-year prognosis for the industry.Whatever may be true of the death of fossil fuels in America and the world, our short- and medium-term future as a society is inextricably linked to the continued availability of oil and gas and their related products. Clean energy’s future may be bright, but the bridge between our present and that future is linked to a robust oil and gas industry that appears to see strong demand for the foreseeable future.It goes without saying that investment gains are never guaranteed. Also, it is true that the exploration and production (E&amp;P) division of the oil and gas sector is one of the most speculative. But it's also true that investments in QOFs rely on guidance from teams of experts with knowledge of the energy industry and qualified opportunity fund structures. Accredited investors willing to take risks and work with expert advisers can gain exposure to what many consider to be one of the most important asset classes of our time.related contentQualified Opportunity Zones With an Energy BoostTax-Smart Strategies for Capital Gains in 2023Opportunity Zones in 2023: A Look Back, a Look ForwardKeeping Property in the Family with LLCs and PartnershipsWhat Assets Should You Put (or Not Put) in Your Trust?]"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The Climate Action Plan (CAP) was released on the sidelines of the bank's board of governors' meeting in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday - its first in-person annual gathering since 2019.AIIB president Jin Liqun said the plan ""outlines our ambition to bring capital, capacity and convening power to help our members in their efforts to address climate change"", adding that it ""builds on what is already a significant area of focus for our bank"".According to Jin, the CAP will build on the AIIB's 2020 pledge to stop bankrolling coal-powered projects and instead ramp up its investments in environmentally friendly schemes.Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank president and chairman Jin Liqun addresses the opening of the bank's annual meeting in Egypt on September 25. Photo: Xinhua alt=Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank president and chairman Jin Liqun addresses the opening of the bank's annual meeting in Egypt on September 25. Photo: Xinhua&gt;The Beijing-based bank - which is 30 per cent owned by the state - had fulfilled its promise to align all new financing with the Paris Agreement, the 2015 international treaty on climate change, he said.Story continuesJin said the AIIB had also met its goal for annual climate financing to account for 50 per cent or more of its total approvals by 2025, with climate financing accounting for 56 per cent last year.Since the bank was established in 2016, US$11.75 billion of its total financing approvals of US$25.25 billion have gone to climate projects, with US$8.29 billion dedicated to mitigation and the rest for adaptation.Jin said the AIIB had financed 107 projects with climate components amid an ever-growing need to support members as they grappled with ever more frequent natural disasters, such as the recent tragedies in Morocco and Libya.He told the meeting that the AIIB was working with other multilateral lenders, such as the World Bank, to co-finance some of the projects.""The AIIB is working closely with our sister institutions to strengthen the family bonds that bind all multilateral development banks [MDBs] together,"" Jin said.A recently announced joint financing arrangement with the World Bank for a US$1 billion guarantee over a selection of sovereign portfolios ""is one such example of our quick and collaborative effort to strengthen the performance of the MDB system"".""We are also proud of our co-financing record as the largest co-financing partner of both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, along with our close co-financing partnerships with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank,"" Jin said.The meeting also heard that three weeks earlier the AIIB had achieved early completion of its 2023 funding programme with the issuance of a US$2 billion three-year global bond.With US$4.8 billion in orders, the bond recorded the largest order book for any bond issued by the AIIB since its inception, Jin said.In May, the bank also placed Asia's first adaptation bond for US$321 million and is working with international asset managers to develop climate change investment frameworks.At the opening of the meeting, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi urged the AIIB and other lenders to help emerging economies, especially in Africa, address the challenging global economic conditions caused by Covid-19 and the Russian war in Ukraine.The banks ""need to provide more low-cost financing"", especially in light of the current financial and economic circumstances, he said.Al-Sisi's plea comes at a time when some African countries have fallen into debt distress, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, along with disruptions to global supply chains and food security.In 2020, Zambia became the first African country to default on some of its debts during the pandemic, finally striking a precedent-setting deal with China and other foreign creditors in May, after 28 months of negotiation.Lusaka's US$6.3 billion in loans - of which US$4.1 billion is owed to China - was restructured through the G20 Common Framework, with Beijing, Zambia's largest lender, providing the deepest level of debt relief among the bilateral creditors. Chad and Ethiopia also applied for debt relief under the same scheme.Egypt, a founding member of the AIIB, has received US$1.3 billion in infrastructure funding, including US$300 million for water management and US$210 million to finance renewable energy.The bank funded Egypt's Benban Solar Park power station, its first energy project investment outside Asia.In July, the AIIB agreed to advance US$280 million for a new metro line in Alexandria. Egypt is a key destination for foreign direct investment, especially from China, whose companies have made vast investments in the Suez Canal Economic Zone.The AIIB has also financed projects in Rwanda, advancing US$200 million through its Crisis Recovery Facility in 2021 for broadband access and an on-lending facility to support small and medium-sized enterprises.In Ivory Coast, the AIIB recently signed a loan deal worth US$200 million for connectivity and rural infrastructure. The government of Ivory Coast and the World Bank are co-financing the project.The AIIB, which has 106 members, has channelled US$44.6 billion to 233 projects in 35 countries, mostly in Asia, including India, Indonesia, as well as Oman, and China's own air quality improvement and coal replacement project.According to the AIIB's action plan, the fight against climate change will be won or lost in Asia, which it described as an engine of global economic growth facing heightened vulnerability to climate hazards.The bank pointed out that the region contributes more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions. Asia's effectiveness in addressing its unique climate challenges was of ""paramount importance"" to the sustainability of societies worldwide, it said.The AIIB has vowed not to finance coal or projects related to the fossil fuel and has excluded oil sector investments, with limited exceptions to ensure basic energy access in remote island communities and hard-to-reach areas.""The AIIB will only selectively finance natural gas projects that are transitional in nature [and] based on stringent criteria.""This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

This projection follows a difficult year for the company in 2023. The company's stock saw a rise of 3.2%, reaching $32.41 during Monday's afternoon trading sessions.The experts at Citi have upgraded their rating of Sealed Air's stock from Neutral to Buy, maintaining the price target at $41. The anticipated boost is attributed to mid-single-digit growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) on a year-over-year basis in 2024. Analysts believe this growth will be driven by cost savings and a rebound in sales volume.Despite facing challenges in 2023 that led to a 35% decrease in stock value due to difficult sales volumes and downward earnings revisions, analysts see several positive factors that could support its valuation. Among these is the potential for Sealed Air to divest parts of its business or consider a merger.In August 2023, while presenting their second fiscal quarter results, Sealed Air's management indicated that they expect weak demand to continue throughout the rest of the year.

These fluctuations raise a crucial question: is Sealed Air's stock significantly undervalued? In this article, we'll delve into the company's valuation, financial strength, profitability, and growth to provide a comprehensive answer.A Closer Look at Sealed Air CorpWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Sign with FDX. Click here to check it out. SEE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SEESealed Air Corp is a leading company in the packaging industry, known for its innovative products such as Cryovac, Darfresh, and OptiDure for food packaging, and Bubble Wrap, Instapak, Jiffy mailers, and shrink film packaging systems for industrial and e-commerce applications. Despite its current stock price of $32.65, the company's fair value, known as the GF Value, is estimated at $55.56. This discrepancy suggests that Sealed Air's stock might be significantly undervalued.Sealed Air (SEE): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? An In-Depth Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique metric that represents the intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on historical multiples that the stock has traded at, an internal adjustment factor from GuruFocus based on the company's past returns and growth, and estimates of future business performance. The GF Value Line, displayed on the summary page, provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to the GF Value, Sealed Air Corp (NYSE:SEE) is significantly undervalued. This conclusion is based on the fact that the company's stock price is considerably below the GF Value Line, indicating that its future returns are likely to be higher. With Sealed Air's stock priced at $32.65 per share, it's estimated to be a significantly undervalued asset.Because Sealed Air is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Story continuesSealed Air (SEE): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? An In-Depth Analysis of Its Market ValueAssessing Sealed Air's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before investing. When considering the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage, Sealed Air's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.06 ranks worse than 85.33% of 375 companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Sealed Air's financial strength as 4 out of 10, suggesting a poor balance sheet.Sealed Air (SEE): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? An In-Depth Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and Growth of Sealed AirInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Sealed Air has been profitable for 10 years over the past 10 years. The company's operating margin of 15.23% is better than 91.08% of 381 companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry, indicating strong profitability.Growth is an essential factor in the valuation of a company. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Sealed Air is 7.4%, which ranks better than 52.07% of 363 companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 17.4%, which ranks better than 74.28% of 346 companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry, indicating promising growth.ROIC vs WACCEvaluating a company's profitability can also involve comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Sealed Air's ROIC was 10.03, while its WACC was 7.76, suggesting potential value creation.Sealed Air (SEE): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage?

The luxury lifestyle company is focused on diversifying and optimizing marketing across a variety of media and platforms in order to deliver a clear, differentiated experience to its target consumers.The company’s three strategic pillars to drive long-term growth and value creation bode well. It has been focused on elevating and energizing its lifestyle brand; driving the core and expanding products; and winning in key cities with its consumer ecosystem.The company’s focus on expanding digital experience has been well-reflected in its share price, with the stock outperforming the industry and the market. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 33.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 4.6%. The stock has also fared better than the sector’s rise of 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 18.5% in the same period.Further optimism on the stock is reflected by its forward estimates, which suggest notable growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RL’s fiscal 2024 sales and earnings suggests growth of 2.8% and 13.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Digital Business’s PerformanceIn the fiscal first quarter, the company’s digital business, including its directly-operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, remained flat year over year. Strength in its international markets more than offset weakness in North America.Starting from June 2023, RL witnessed improvement in its North America digital unit. It reached a milestone of 53.5 million social media followers globally, which reflects a year-over-year high-single-digit increase. This was mainly driven by the company’s popularity on Instagram, Line, TikTok, WeChat and other key platforms. RL continues to witness online search trends outpacing its peers globally, driven by spring icons and accessories. Region-wise, digital sales were up 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia.For fiscal 2024, management revealed plans for rich digital content and greater customer personalization. It is focused on further digital investments to continue the creation of content for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve its consumers more efficiently.Ralph Lauren continues to scale and expand its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” and endless aisle product availability. The company launched its first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app last holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform.The company is also on track to exceed its top and bottom-line targets under the “Next Great Chapter” plan announced in June 2018. This plan aims at creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities. As part of the plan, it completed the transition of Chaps to a licensed business, thus concluding its portfolio realignment announced last year. The move will likely enable it to focus on core brands as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy.Story continuesHurdles on the WayRalph Lauren has been reeling under continued product cost inflation and higher compensation. RL expects higher marketing and ecosystem investments for the fiscal second quarter. The company is also witnessing macro inflationary challenges, particularly in North America. This led to a dismal performance in its North America segment in the fiscal first quarter. Higher promotions in the North America market and an unfavorable wholesale timing shift acted as deterrents.Key PicksWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely GIII Apparel Group GIII, Guess GES and Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL.GIII Apparel currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, it has recently witnessed a daily loss of 1.87%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of -0.71%. Fresh insights from the GF Score hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of PG&amp;E Corp.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with PCG. Click here to check it out. PCG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PCGPG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 5/10Growth rank: 1/10GF Value rank: 1/10Momentum rank: 9/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned PG&amp;E Corp the GF Score of 55 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Snapshot of PG&amp;E Corp's BusinessPG&amp;E Corp is a holding company whose main subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric, a regulated utility operating in Central and Northern California. It serves 5.3 million electricity customers and 4.6 million gas customers in 47 of the state's 58 counties. PG&amp;E operated under bankruptcy court supervision between January 2019 and June 2020. In 2004, PG&amp;E sold its unregulated assets as part of an earlier postbankruptcy reorganization. The company has a market cap of $42.07 billion and reported sales of $22.26 billion. Its operating margin stands at 9.35%.Story continuesPG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisPG&amp;E Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company has an interest coverage ratio of 0.89, which positions it worse than 94.91% of 432 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.45, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.35, which is worse than 90.13% of 456 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 8.18, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 83.52% of 443 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Profitability AnalysisPG&amp;E Corp's low Profitability rank can also raise warning signals. PG&amp;E Corp's Operating Margin has declined over the past five years ((-22.59%)), as shown by the following data: 2018: 12.36; 2019: 7.83; 2020: 10.86; 2021: 10.37; 2022: 9.57; .Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where PG&amp;E Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -32.1 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 98.56% of 486 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, PG&amp;E Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.PG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven PG&amp;E Corp's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While the company has a rich history and a significant market presence, its current financial indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its past performance levels. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Never miss another market-moving headline.Microsoft has no more Sell ratings as Guggenheim upgradesGuggenheim upgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Neutral from Sell, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro. Following this upgrade, there are no more sell-side analysts that rate Microsoft with a Sell or equivalent rating.Guggenheim admitted they were “dead wrong” to recommend Microsoft as Sell. “The Generative AI narrative is too positive a force to contend with, even though the troubling dynamics we thought might develop, did,” mentioned in a client note.And like every other person on the planet, we’ve come to expect that the GenAI “narrative” will become more than just a story, though we still question how much monetization will be realized and over what timeframe.DraftKings shares gain on JPMorgan upgradeDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) shares rose more than 3% pre-market today after JPMorgan upgraded the company to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $37.00 from $26.00.The upgrade is based on the recent underperformance of the company’s shares, despite the sector's attractiveness and strong growth prospects in existing and new markets. Additionally, the firm noted that DraftKings' efficient cost control measures, combined with its competitive strengths like product, scale, and brand recognition, position the company well against emerging competitors such as PENN Entertainment's (NASDAQ:PENN) ESPNBet and Fanatics.SiteOne Landscape Supply raised to Buy at UBSUBS upgraded Siteone Landscape Supply (NYSE:SITE) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $200.00 from $145.00.The rationale behind the upgrade includes the observation that the company's earnings have already hit their low point, with expected positive EBITDA growth in the second half of 2023 and further acceleration in 2024 and 2025. The resilience to macroeconomic risks is also highlighted, attributed to its 36% maintenance mix and the normalization of demand that occurred between 2020 and 2021.Story continuesAdditionally, UBS sees momentum in recent deals that should drive growth, and the company has the financial capacity and management expertise for further expansion.2 more upgradesStifel upgraded Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $200.00 from $180.00.We believe the company is poised to successfully lap difficult comp comparisons in the 2H23 as menu innovation and delivery channel growth, augmented by rapid expansion in the national ad fund, continue to build top-of-mind awareness and drive incremental usage.Wedbush upgraded CarMax (NYSE:KMX) to Outperform from Neutral and raised its price target to $90.00 from $85.00.The firm believes that CarMax is approaching an inflection point in growth and market share performance while continuing to improve profitability. The firm noted that CarMax underperformed the retail used car industry's unit growth in the third quarter of the previous year due to challenging comparisons and a focus on profit rather than unit sales.

However, recent developments suggest the role of AI in guiding stock market trends might be overstated.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the renowned chip manufacturer, has exemplified this trend with its substantial sales growth due to generative AI. The company's revenue witnessed a remarkable turnaround from a decline in the first quarter to a 101% increase, exceeding Wall Street's predictions in its last two earnings reports. This development surpasses Nvidia's previous high during the crypto boom and sets the stage for an anticipated higher revenue in the third quarter of 2023.Despite these achievements, there are indications that the fervor around AI could be overstated. One such sign is the fluctuating user traffic on ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that has sparked interest in generative AI. Following a dip in utilization over the summer, there has been a recent recovery in usage coinciding with schools reopening. This pattern suggests that ChatGPT's popularity is primarily driven by students using it for homework assistance.Adding to these concerns are unconfirmed rumors that Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:MSFT) may be reducing orders for Nvidia H100 AI chips. This speculation arises from slowing traffic on ChatGPT and lower-than-expected interest in Microsoft 365 Copilot.Microsoft's hefty $13 billion investment in OpenAI—the organization behind ChatGPT—could now be facing hurdles. CEO Satya Nadella had previously fueled enthusiasm around generative AI by claiming it would revolutionize search engines. However, since launching its ChatGPT-powered version of Bing, the search engine landscape remains largely unchanged with Google (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:GOOGL) continuing to dominate the market and generate significant profits.Investors are being cautioned to temper their expectations regarding AI.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a renowned chip manufacturer, has surpassed Wall Street's expectations in its last two earnings reports, experiencing significant sales growth due to generative AI. The company's revenue has seen an unprecedented surge from negative growth in the first quarter to a 101% increase. This growth exceeds its peak during the crypto boom, with even higher revenue expected in the third quarter of 2023.However, there are indications that the narrative of AI leading stock market trends may be overinflated. One such indication is the fluctuating traffic on ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that sparked interest in generative AI. Although traffic seems to be recovering now that schools have reopened, the platform experienced a drop in usage during the summer, suggesting its popularity was driven primarily by students seeking homework assistance.Speculation is also circulating that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is reducing orders for Nvidia H100 AI chips due to slowing traffic on ChatGPT and less-than-anticipated interest in Microsoft 365 Copilot. These rumors remain unverified but suggest that the enthusiasm surrounding AI might be exaggerated.Microsoft, which invested $13 billion in OpenAI—the creator of ChatGPT—may now be facing challenges. CEO Satya Nadella previously fueled excitement around generative AI, claiming it would revolutionize search engines. However, since launching its ChatGPT-powered version of Bing, there has been little change in search engine dynamics. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to dominate the market and generate substantial profits.Investors are cautioned to temper their expectations surrounding AI. While AI's potential is undeniable, the widespread adoption of these new tools will take time. For instance, the internet and smartphones took several years to become mainstream. Investors are advised to avoid overhype in the AI sector, focusing instead on diversification, value consideration, and patience.

High inflation, monetary tightening, the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and slowing demand from key trading partners is contributing to the economic slowdown. However, 2024 will witness the nation's economic growth strengthen significantly, reaching 2.6%, driven primarily by the resurgence of private consumption and investment, as well as increased public expenditure.As such, Poland is a dynamic destination for businesses and expatriates. July 2022 saw the Polish government adopting the “Productivity Strategy 2030,” aimed at creating a digitized industry, increasing technological use, and developing an algorithmic data-based economy. Efforts to expand the economy include supporting high-tech investments, supporting scientific research, entrepreneurship, and innovation, as well as increasing productivity and foreign trade. To enable this, the country welcomes foreign investment to enjoy unrestricted access to the Polish market as a source of its growth, capital, jobs, and also a vehicle for transferring technology and integration into global supply chains.Currently, more than 1500 American companies operate in the country.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), subsidiary of Google has launched a Cloud region, the first of such an investment in Poland and Central and Eastern Europe. Similarly, April 2023 saw Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) opening its newest trusted cloud region, the first in Central and Eastern Europe, in the country too.“Microsoft’s investment in Poland will accelerate our country’s transformation into a technology hub for the Central and Eastern European region, thanks to the development of the Polish Digital Valley, hundreds of engineers and developers will be able to play a key role in the global economy without leaving the country. This is responsible development.”Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.Poland is also set to serve as the ideal location for Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)'s first strategic Tech and Product Hub. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a global leader in digital payments, aims to drive continued rapid growth in digital commerce and payments through its investment in Poland. In light of Poland's economic trajectory and its proactive stance toward fostering a modern, tech-driven economy, it is evident that the country is poised to become an attractive and dynamic destination for businesses, expatriates, and retirees alike.

If you wish to skip our discussion on the infrastructure industry, head directly to 5 Best Infrastructure ETFs.As noted by Deloitte, significant changes in the economy, along with the transition to remote work and telemedicine, are causing noteworthy effects on infrastructure. Traditional physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and power systems is undergoing a transformation, becoming increasingly digital. This shift places an emphasis on technologies like broadband, self-driving vehicles, and intelligent infrastructure. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on environmental considerations and broader societal advantages that are influencing the infrastructure sector's evolution. Deloitte's report highlights key findings regarding how governments worldwide are shifting their infrastructure investments to adapt to changing trends. Notably, respondents believe that technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity will exert the most significant influence on infrastructure projects. AI and machine learning, in particular, are expected to have a substantial impact, with 55% of those surveyed expressing this view. As governments transition towards more digitally-oriented infrastructure, there is a growing concern about cyber risks. A significant majority, 76% of respondents, expect a heightened focus on data security over the next few years. Moreover, there is a noticeable demand for green infrastructure, with 60% of those surveyed expressing intentions to invest in urban spaces designed for walking, cycling, socializing, and dining.Also Read: 12 Best European ETFs to BuyPwC highlighted that the infrastructure sector faced significant changes globally, driven by factors like the availability of funds, evolving social and environmental concerns, and rapid urbanization. COVID-19 introduced new challenges and its full impact will take time to unfold. In the short term, it will reshape the industry in four ways – increasing focus on operational resilience, affordability, the adoption of new technologies, and sustainability. Successful infrastructure projects require collaboration among various stakeholders, each with their own interests and agendas.Story continuesIn 2022, the infrastructure sector remained resilient, even in the face of market challenges, according to UBS. Ongoing trends like digitalization and decarbonization will continue to drive the need for new investments. However, the overall economic conditions have significantly deteriorated. Investors can no longer rely on cheap credit to boost their investment returns. Moving forward, they must adopt a more strategic approach to investment and asset management to achieve positive outcomes. Inflation has drawn considerable attention to private infrastructure investments. This asset class has gained a reputation for its ability to stand strong in inflationary situations, mainly because it can adjust prices effectively and pass on higher costs to customers. Its defensive characteristics make it particularly appealing when times are uncertain, serving as a safe haven for investors. Performance data from 2005 to 2021 shows that private infrastructure investments performed better than public ones, especially when inflation was higher than usual. This performance difference became even more obvious when inflation was high and economic growth was slow. It is likely for the trend to continue through 2023, given that private markets had already outperformed public markets in the first half of the year.Don't Miss: 10 Best Mid-Cap Growth ETFsSimilarly, J.P. Morgan's insights underline the strength and versatility of core private infrastructure investments. They seem to perform well regardless of economic cycles, highlighting the importance of diversifying investment portfolios. Similar trends are expected to continue throughout 2023. Katarina Roele, PhD, stated:“Significant attractive investment opportunities in core private infrastructure remain due to the structural tailwinds of the need to modernize, replace and decarbonize existing assets.”The global economy is grappling with challenges such as a recession, monetary tightening, rising living costs, and disruptions in various markets. Inflation is anticipated to remain high throughout the year, and this, along with labor shortages and pricing pressures, might pose challenges for plans involving significant construction and growth strategies. The global economic outlook suggests that we can expect slower, and in some cases, even stagnant growth in the near future. Many countries are heading towards recessions at a rapid pace. In this scenario, assets that do not generate much immediate cash flow and rely heavily on long-term growth or high exit values may face challenges. On the other hand, assets with a significant portion of their revenue coming from contracted or regulated sources, along with terms linked to inflation, are likely to fare better in this tough economic climate.In this article, we discuss some of the best infrastructure ETFs, which offer investors exposure to companies like Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH).Our MethodologyWe used an ETF screener and filtered out the best infrastructure ETFs based on their 5-year performance.

While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Archer-Daniels-Midland with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland Archer-Daniels-Midland's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$258m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.6% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Archer-Daniels-Midland To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Archer-Daniels-Midland's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the beverage industry and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Beverage Stocks with Dividends. Beverage stocks are companies that are primarily engaged in the production, distribution, and sale of beverages. These companies operate in the beverage industry, which encompasses a wide range of products, including soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, bottled water, energy drinks, and dairy-based beverages.After a summer of strong spending by American consumers, bars, hotels, and restaurants believe that the period of excessive spending by US consumers following the pandemic is probably over, according to a report by CNN. The Federal Reserve's recent ""Beige Book"" economic report mentioned that some of the Fed’s regional districts have observed that tourism activity had either reached its highest point or was starting to slow down. This is seen as an indication that consumer spending in the US, which plays a significant role in the country's overall economic activity, might be changing in the upcoming months. One of the main reasons for this slowdown is growing inflation and economic challenges. According to RSM US, consumers are buying store-brand products to save money. Food companies that used to do well by selling high-quality and natural products are now facing challenges because their costs are going up.However, the industry has experienced rapid growth over the years. According to the Food and Beverages Global Market Report 2023, the global food and beverage industry grew at a CAGR of 7.3% in 2023, reaching 7,221.73 billion. The report further mentioned that the global food and beverages market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% by 2027.Also Read: 25 Largest Beverage Companies in the Word in 2023The food and beverage industry has been experiencing various trends and growth patterns in different segments. In one of the recent developments, the major food companies around the world are making commitments to reduce emissions throughout their entire supply chain, Forbes reported. The report further mentioned that most of the emissions, typically over 90%, come from ""Scope 3 emissions."" These emissions are not created directly by the company but by the companies they work with, like suppliers, carriers, and partners who help make their products. In the food and beverage industry, farmers play a crucial role as suppliers. If these farmers don't adopt more sustainable practices when growing crops, the big food companies won't be able to meet their goals for reducing carbon emissions.Story continuesInvestors have increasingly turned their focus to stocks in the ever-evolving food and beverage industry. Though the S&amp;P Food &amp; Beverage Select Industry Index is underperforming the broader market this year, major beverage stocks are producing positive returns for shareholders. Companies like PepsiCo, Inc.

The stock recently suffered a daily loss of -1.57%, and a 3-month loss of -17.71%. However, with an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 0.88, the question arises: is the stock significantly undervalued? In this article, we delve into the valuation analysis of Southwest Airlines Co, providing an in-depth assessment of its financial health and future prospects.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with LUV. Click here to check it out. LUV 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LUVSouthwest Airlines Co, the largest domestic air carrier in the United States, operates over 700 aircraft in an all-Boeing 737 fleet. Specializing in short-haul, leisure flights with a point-to-point network, the airline has carved out a niche for itself in the competitive aviation sector. Despite its current stock price of $27.61, the GF Value estimates its fair value at $62.27, suggesting that the stock might be significantly undervalued.Southwest Airlines Co (LUV): A Hidden Gem in the Aviation Industry?Understanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary valuation model that estimates a stock's intrinsic value. It is based on historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor from GuruFocus based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides a visual representation of a stock's fair trading value. If a stock's price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is likely overvalued and may yield poor future returns. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, it could be undervalued and yield higher future returns.According to the GF Value, Southwest Airlines Co appears to be significantly undervalued. With a market cap of $16.40 billion, the stock's current price is significantly below the GF Value Line. This suggests that the long-term return of Southwest Airlines Co's stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Story continuesSouthwest Airlines Co (LUV): A Hidden Gem in the Aviation Industry?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Evaluating Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. As such, it's crucial to evaluate a company's financial health before investing. Southwest Airlines Co has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.31, ranking better than 72.45% of 940 companies in the Transportation industry. Based on these metrics, GuruFocus ranks Southwest Airlines Co's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Southwest Airlines Co (LUV): A Hidden Gem in the Aviation Industry?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially those that demonstrate consistent profitability over the long term. Southwest Airlines Co has been profitable 9 years over the past 10 years. However, its operating margin of 2.07% is worse than 76.47% of 952 companies in the Transportation industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Southwest Airlines Co's profitability as fair.Growth is a critical factor in a company's valuation. The faster a company grows, the more likely it is to create value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. However, the 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Southwest Airlines Co is -3.8%, which ranks worse than 70.77% of 917 companies in the Transportation industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -22.3%, ranking worse than 89.78% of 822 companies in the Transportation industry. This suggests that Southwest Airlines Co's growth is relatively weak.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business, while WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Southwest Airlines Co's ROIC was 1.4, while its WACC came in at 7.5.Southwest Airlines Co (LUV): A Hidden Gem in the Aviation Industry?ConclusionIn conclusion, Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) appears to be significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is fair. However, its growth ranks worse than 89.78% of 822 companies in the Transportation industry.

During the past three years, Philip Morris International Inc's earnings increased by approximately 8.00% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 47.5% of global competitors.Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 7.50%, underperforms than approximately 45.16% of global competitors.Next StepsGiven the comprehensive analysis of Philip Morris International Inc's dividend payments, dividend growth rate, payout ratio, profitability, and growth metrics, it's clear that the company has a strong history of consistent dividends. However, the high payout ratio coupled with underperformance in growth metrics relative to global competitors raises questions about the sustainability of its dividends in the long run. Investors should therefore consider these factors carefully while making investment decisions. Remember, a strong dividend history does not guarantee future performance. Always conduct thorough research and consider the company's overall financial health before investing.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

With this much macroeconomic uncertainty, there’s a good argument to be made in either direction.Today, however, we’re not looking at S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. Rather, we’re going to zero in on the S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGiven the headwinds facing the economy, these S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell will be lucky to hold their own even in a bull market, and they could full-on crash if a recession occurs.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been one of the year’s most popular technology stocks. Traders gravitate to the firm’s possibilities in fast-moving areas such as artificial intelligence-powered chips. As the year winds up, though, it’s among the S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell.However, at least so far, AMD hasn’t transformed the excitement into improved operating results. In fact, AMD’s revenues and earnings have fallen sharply year-over-year.Meanwhile, AMD’s dedicated AI chips appear unlikely to generate much traction until 2024 and so far lack much in the way of high-profile customers or proven market demand.Meanwhile, overall semiconductor market demand appears to be fading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) sent shockwaves through the sector when it announced delays in new production given weak customer demand and inventory concerns.Since firms like AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) buy from TSM, this is a direct warning sign that next quarter’s earnings could be greatly disappointing.American Airlines (AAL)An American Airlines (AAL) airplane waiting on the tarmac. Represents airline stocks.Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.comTraders made significant money on the travel reopening trade. As people got out of their homes and started going on vacation again, it led to huge profits for travel companies thanks to all the pent-up demand.Story continuesHowever, this trade is rapidly ending. Year-over-year growth numbers have come down significantly, which isn’t surprising as 2022 was a boom time for travel.Meanwhile, with leisure and hospitality firms reporting large profits, workers are demanding a fat cut of the pie.American Airlines (NYSE:AAL) ust gave a huge pay increase to its pilots to avoid the sort of strike that could cripple the automakers this fall. It makes sense why American paid its employees a lot more, particularly given the pilot shortage in the industry.That said, with travel demand now rolling over, the higher labor costs will eat into American’s profits. That’s to say nothing of the suddenly soaring price of jet fuel.Meanwhile, American’s gargantuan debt load continues to poise a major risk as interest rates keep on climbing. All this leads to a resounding conclusion: American’s profitability is heading down and the stock price is likely to follow.Autodesk (ADSK)An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comJudging by the headlines, growth stocks are having an exceptional year. But a handful of mega-cap technology companies that have sharply outperformed this year influenced the Nasdaq Index. Under the surface, the indicators are decidedly more mixed.The thing is that while there are pockets of strength, such as in artificial intelligence companies, most growth companies are seeing a decided slowdown in business. Take graphics software company Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), for example.After many years of double-digits annual revenue growth, analysts see Autodesk notching less than 9% revenue growth this year.The firm’s 29 times forward P/E ratio, however, reflects something we’d expect to see on a younger and more dynamic firm. Autodesk was founded way back in 1982.Arguably, it has already largely tapped its potential addressable market, and it could be at risk of disruption from AI solutions. All this makes ADSK a risky bet as growth slows.Royal Caribbean (RCL)Serenade of the Seas cruiseSource: NAN728 / Shutterstock.comRoyal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) faces many of the same challenges that American Airlines does. Slowing consumer spending and rising labor and fuel costs are likely to hit the cruise industry hard.In some ways, cruise lines will face even more perilous waters than the airlines. At least there is still a business travel recovery story to bolster the airlines.While vacation traffic is likely peaking now, the return to the office and rebound in business travel gives airlines something to look forward to.Cruises, however, have very little positive going forward. Consumer spending will be declining, and many people already sated the urge to go cruising in 2022 and 2023 once the world started to reopen.Royal Caribbean also faces a mountain of debt. In fact, it has racked up more than $18 billion in long-term debt and is paying nearly $1.5 billion per year in interest payments. This leaves it in a vulnerable position as the economy softens.Target (TGT)an image of bullseye the target dog in a target storeSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comThe United States just reached a new record high in total outstanding consumer credit card debt, topping the $1 trillion mark. The government’s pandemic-era relief has long since run out and many American households are finding themselves trapped deeper than ever in bills.Things will get worse before they get better.Soaring interest rates make it more expensive to buy houses, cars, and pay for consumer credit. Meanwhile, long-paused student loan payments are starting back up momentarily, adding yet more strain. Inflation inexorably keeps driving up prices of essential goods.All this to say, it’s a rough time for retailers of things that are “nice to have” rather than essentials. This puts Target (NYSE:TGT) in particular in a rough spot.Target has attractive merchandising and many shoppers prefer its more upscale experience to that of more value-focused rivals such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT).With the economic slump bearing down, it remains to be seen if middle class shoppers will still have the extra disposable income to keep places like Target humming. TGT stock has already slumped over the past year.I fear analyst estimates and price targets are still much too high. As a weak holiday shopping season arrives, don’t be at all surprised when TGT stock drops below the $100 mark.Simon Property Group (SPG)building facade of simon property group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWeakening consumer spending won’t just affect retailers this holiday season, it will also have a negative impact on the landlords who own the buildings where those retailers do business.This brings us to Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), which is the nation’s largest publicly traded mall owner. In addition, it operates outlet malls and some international shopping centers.Simon is playing a long game. It needs to maintain cash flows and dividends to please its current shareholders while at the same time investing heavily to convert empty parts of its malls into more attractive features.The collapse of department store chains, in particular, has caused mall owners such as Simon to pour tens of millions of dollars into individual existing malls to reposition those spaces for restaurants, entertainment facilities, coworking spaces, or so on.Potential mall conversions from retail to apartments would be even more expensive given issues such as plumbing.Simon is grinding through this period, making defensive moves such as acquiring failing retail stores like JC Penney in order to keep them running at their malls rather than shuttering entirely.However, this adds risk for Simon on an operational level. Losses could mount in a recession. With higher interest rates and student loan payments restarting, this will pressure Simon at the worst possible time.Constellation Brands (STZ)Three bottles of Corona beer are arranged in a bowl with ice.Source: ShinoStock / Shutterstock.comConstellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) is a large alcohol company that sells a variety of spirits, wine and beer products. It also made some ill-fated investments in the cannabis space years ago.The company’s crown jewel today is its Mexican beer business, specifically the Modelo brands. Constellation gained control of these assets in the early 2010s thanks to antitrust regulators forcing Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) to divest Modelo as part of a merger.Constellation has enjoyed a boom in Mexican beer sales in recent years. Corona sales spiked during the pandemic as consumers ironically embraced the brand.Constellation’s beer labels have gained even more sales thanks to the Bud Light boycott, which has caused many drinkers to switch their buying habits.However, investors have become way too enamored of STZ stock. Constellation shares are now up to 22 times forward earnings.That’s a large premium for a beer stock, especially when rival Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) is at just 12 times forward earnings while also benefitting from the Bud Light boycott.In the bigger picture, beer is a declining business, and the industry faces profit margin pressures. All this makes STZ stock one to avoid today.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TAP stock.

Continued incidence of mental health issues among Americans is expected to sustain the solid demand for behavioral healthcare services, which in turn is likely to continue benefiting its revenues in the days ahead. Management forecasts 2023 revenues to be within $2.86-$2.90 billion, the midpoint of which implies a 10.3% improvement from the 2022 reported figure.Story continuesAcadia Healthcare follows a commendable growth strategy, as part of which it pursues acquisitions, adds beds to its existing facilities and has JVs with renowned U.S. health systems. ACHC remains on track to achieve its target of adding around 300 beds to its existing facilities this year, out of which it has already added 204 beds in the first half of 2023.Strong nationwide demand for the medication-assisted treatment of patients suffering from opioid use disorder may prompt Acadia Healthcare to expand its network of comprehensive treatment centers (CTCs) in the days ahead. ACHC aims to open a minimum of six CTC’s this year.The JV’s enable the behavioral healthcare facility operator to inaugurate new facilities and subsequently, expand its healthcare network and nationwide reach. It has 20 JVs in place, out of which the most recent one was with Nebraska Methodist Health System for building a behavioral health hospital across Iowa and equipping Acadia Healthcare to enter a new state with its acute service line.The portfolio of ACHC comprised 250 behavioral healthcare facilities stretched throughout 39 states and Puerto Rico as of Jun 30, 2023.Acadia Healthcare boasts a strong financial position, supported by solid cash reserves, which remains sufficient enough to service its short-term debt obligations. It also had $505 million available under its $600 million revolving credit facility as of Jun 30, 2023. Adequate cash-generating abilities also bear testament to its financial strength, which equips it to undertake uninterrupted business investments.

Solomon emphasized the crucial role these companies play in the global economy and within Goldman Sachs itself.At the American Energy Security Summit held in Oklahoma City, Solomon voiced his belief that financial backing for traditional energy firms will continue for a considerable period. His views mirror those of other Wall Street executives who resist escalating demands from environmental advocates to halt their financial support of fossil fuel companies. This resistance has sparked disruptions at banking events and protests outside corporate offices.In 2020, Solomon highlighted that the majority of the world's energy was still derived from fossil fuels, leading to an increase in emissions. He recognized the need to shift towards more sustainable energy sources gradually but warned that such a transition would take a significant amount of time.Earlier this year, a group of shareholders approached the six largest US banks, including Goldman Sachs, requesting them to slowly withdraw their funding from oil and gas exploration and development activities. However, these proposals have yet to yield any substantial results.During a visit to his alma mater, Hamilton College, Solomon further expressed his stance on traditional energy. Some students later anonymously voiced their dissatisfaction with Solomon's views in a letter to the college newspaper. They argued that he had criticized the fossil-fuel divestment movement and suggested they needed to understand how the world ""really worked"" by visiting countries like China, India, and Cambodia. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs clarified that Solomon did not mean to offend the students.The CEO underscored the importance of supporting traditional energy sources, particularly considering current geopolitical events. He cautioned that without reliable and reasonably priced energy, societal functioning could be at risk.Story continuesSolomon concluded his remarks by acknowledging the complexity of transitioning to more sustainable energy sources.

The new initiative is expected to enhance transparency and reduce costs, according to the parties involved.The consortium, dubbed 'Endoxa', has enlisted the services of financial technology firm Droit to develop a Position Reporting Utility. This tool aims to improve the quality of disclosures regarding clients’ long and short bets across different markets. ""They are getting our help to facilitate the correct and timely reporting of those positions,"" Brock Arnason, CEO of Droit, said in an interview.The banks' collaborative move comes as regulators worldwide are pushing for increased disclosures from hedge funds and other asset managers about their investments. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been drafting new rules requiring more transparency on certain types of derivatives. This regulatory push was motivated by trader Bill Hwang's massive derivative positions that led to the collapse of his family office Archegos Capital Management, exposing a regulatory blind spot.The Position Reporting Utility will function by reviewing disclosure rules across key jurisdictions with the help of the law firm Allen&amp;Overy. The consortium will then develop a consensus view on meeting these obligations. Droit will translate this consensus into a model that banks can use to better understand their reporting obligations for each trade.""Creating this consortium will enable us as financial institutions to more effectively and efficiently navigate the regulatory complexity of the global position reporting rules while retaining each firm’s ownership of the underlying risks,"" Richard Hempsell, Global Head of Core Operations at Goldman Sachs, said in a statement.

The SEC found that Goldman Sachs was responsible for submitting 22,000 inadequate 'blue sheet' submissions between 2012 and 2022, affecting over 163 million transactions. The bank has acknowledged the findings and is currently rectifying its remaining EBS deficiencies.The announcement of the penalty resulted in Goldman Sachs' shares declining by 0.9% at the end of Friday trading. This follows a steady decline of 4.8% since a 6% increase from September 11 to 14. Overall, Goldman Sachs' share price has dropped by 5.29% in 2023.In addition to the fine, Goldman Sachs is also dealing with the fallout from its acquisition of fintech lender GreenSky. Purchased for $2.24 billion in an all-stock transaction in 2021, the lender is now expected to be sold for just $500 million. Advanced negotiations are reportedly underway with a consortium of investors including Sixth Street, Pacific Management Investment, and KKR.The bank's venture into consumer banking has resulted in $3 billion in losses, leading to a strategy shift back towards core business areas and a divestment of most unsecured consumer loans since last year. Its second-quarter earnings report showed an earnings per share of $3.08 compared to the expected $3.18, and an 8% decrease in revenue from the previous year at $10.9 billion.Despite these challenges, Goldman Sachs has seen some success with several market debuts it has led recently, including the Arm IPO which boosted the British chip designer's valuation to $65 billion. However, investor concerns remain as share prices of newly listed companies like Arm and Instacart have seen significant drops since their debuts.As part of its cost-saving strategy, Goldman Sachs is planning another round of job cuts that could result in a 5% reduction in global headcount.

GPN shares have jumped 20.2% in the past six months, outperforming the 6.8% increase of the industry, as investors like the solid contributions from its merchant and core issuer businesses. Also, its strong 2023 guidance and transaction growth are benefiting the stock.Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Global Payments is a payment technology and software solutions services provider worldwide. It has a market cap of $31 billion and currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan GPN Retain Momentum?The answer is yes, thanks to the rising estimates, and growing operating and financial strengths.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share currently stands at $10.40, implying an 11.6% year-over-year increase. It has witnessed 10 upward estimate revisions in the past 60 days against one in the opposite direction. GPN beat earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed on the other occasions, with an average surprise of 1.1%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $8.7 billion, indicating a 7.2% year-over-year rise. This company is poised for long-term growth due to solid digital payment prospects.With the rising demand for digital payment methods amid the growing digitalization of economies worldwide, Global Payments’ services are expected to generate a high yield. An increase in the middle-class demographic in emerging markets is likely to fuel growth. This is expected to bring more traffic to its network and boost transaction volumes.In 2023, our estimate for revenues from the Merchant Solutions business indicates 16% year-over-year growth. New sales and the acquisition of the EVO business are expected to contribute to the upside. Similarly, core issuer growth and expanding commercial card transactions are likely to aid its Issuer Solutions business. We expect revenues from this unit to jump nearly 6% in 2023 from the year-ago levels.Story continuesThe stock is significantly undervalued than the industry at the moment. It is trading at forward 12-month price to earnings of 10.35X, lower than the industry average of 20.62X.Also, GPN’s strong financial flexibility is commendable. It had nearly $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents at June-end compared with the current portion of long-term debt of $75.7 million. Moreover, the company’s operating cash flows have been increasing over the years. It estimates to generate $15 billion of adjusted free cash flow cumulatively for the 2021-2025 period. Global Payments generated almost $1.2 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of 2023.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that can hold back GPN’s growth. Rising operating costs are hampering its margins. For 2023, we expect adjusted total operating expenses to increase 5% year over year.Also, emerging payment companies with significant growth are rapidly capturing markets, which can put pressure on GPN’s prices. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Key Picks in Business ServicesSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector are Shift4 Payments, Inc.

The hydrocarbon energy market offers compelling narratives, having undergone an impressive metamorphosis. During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, demand for these assets waned significantly. Fast forward to today, and hydrocarbon energy prices have surged, making them worthy of consideration.Two factors lie at the heart of this resurgence. First, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, under the OPEC+ banner, have extended oil output cuts through 2023. This decision squeezes supply, driving up prices.Second, as highlighted by Bloomberg, political pressures and changing industry priorities have deterred energy companies from adding oil capacity. Instead, a shift toward chemicals and new materials is evident.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSuch dynamics, while troublesome for consumers, could be music to the ears of savvy investors. Let’s delve deeper into the most promising oil stocks to buy now.Chevron (CVX)Chevron Earnings: CVX Stock Sinks Amid Spending CutsSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAs a vertically integrated oil and gas powerhouse, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) covers the entirety of the energy industry’s value chain. From upstream operations in exploration and production to midstream storage and transportation, and down to downstream refining and marketing, Chevron has it all. Though it may not be the flashiest pick among stocks to buy now, there’s a reassuring stability to CVX.Boasting a robust balance sheet, Chevron’s equity-to-asset ratio sits at an impressive 0.63x, outperforming 67.4% of its industry counterparts. In terms of financial performance, the company has shown consistent long-term revenue growth and commendable net margins.While the Covid-19 pandemic did pose challenges, Chevron’s history of profitability remains intact. Its forward earnings multiple of 11.68 might seem a tad pricey, but in exchange, investors are backing an incredibly stable entity.Story continuesAdditionally, Chevron’s dividend game is strong. It offers a forward yield of 3.62%. Though slightly below the sector average, it’s hard to overlook the company’s track record of 37 consecutive years of dividend increases. Market analysts label CVX as a moderate buy, setting their sights on a price target of $192.92, suggesting an upside potential of nearly 16% in the coming year.Enbridge (ENB)Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comStepping into the realm of multinational pipeline and energy companies, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is an essential pillar for the nation’s infrastructural framework. The company’s crude oil system stretches an extensive 17,809 miles, underscoring its relevance. Yet despite its significance, ENB has faced challenges in the market.However, the tide may soon turn for Enbridge, positioning it as a potential candidate among stocks to buy now. While there are legitimate investor concerns — like Enbridge’s hefty debt reflected in its cash-to-debt ratio of 0.01x and declining revenue growth — demand dynamics could be the game-changer. Basic supply-demand principles point toward a potential uptick.In terms of valuation, ENB’s forward earnings multiple stands at 17.39x. On the brighter side, the company boasts a healthy operating margin of 19.48% and has maintained profitability over the past decade. When it comes to dividends, Enbridge’s forward yield of 7.55% is eye-catching.But potential investors should also consider its high payout ratio of 127.07%. Still, analysts lean toward a moderate buy recommendation for ENB, eyeing a price target of $40.92, indicating possible 17% upside.Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDiving into the midstream and downstream sectors of the hydrocarbon value chain, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) seems poised for positive momentum, especially within its marketing business unit. As communities gradually emerge from the shadows of the Covid-19 pandemic, we’re witnessing a surge in roadway traffic, which should inevitably amplify demand at Phillips 66’s gasoline stations.What investors get with Phillips 66 isn’t necessarily a financial dynamo but rather a steady performer. Take its Altman Z-Score of 4.1, for instance — it suggests a firm financial footing.Value hunters might see PSX as a potential entry among stocks to buy now, given its compelling metrics. A notable three-year revenue growth rate of 14.9% is paired with a trading multiple of just 5.25x on trailing earnings, placing it at a competitive advantage against 73.15% of its peers.Further sweetening the deal, Phillips 66 offers a forward dividend yield of 3.51%. Although this might trail the sector’s average, a modest payout ratio of 31.93% reinforces confidence in dividend sustainability. The analyst community, for its part, slates PSX as a moderate buy, projecting a price target of $131.64, which hints at 7.5% upside potential.Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the behemoth in the oilfield services domain, takes pride in being both the world’s premier offshore drilling company and its top offshore drilling contractor by revenue. Though SLB’s performance this year has left some investors wanting, a noticeable uptrend since early July suggests a shift in sentiment.The prospect of further upside makes SLB a contender in the list of stocks to buy now. Granted, its financials have been wobbly — with the pandemic leading to a downturn in its three-year revenue growth. However, a revived thirst for oil has kindled demand for Schlumberger’s services. The latest sales metrics underscore a marked improvement in the company’s top line.From a valuation standpoint, SLB’s forward earnings multiple of 16.65x might seem steep. However, with the oil sector catching a positive tailwind, this premium could be more palatable than prohibitive.Although the forward dividend yield of 1.66% may not turn many heads, a supremely low payout ratio of 27.29% offers reassurance. Drawing insights from market analysts, SLB receives a strong buy recommendation with a price target set at $67.91, suggesting a potential upside of more than 12%.Northern Oil and Gas (NOG)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comSpecializing in exploration and production, Northern Oil and Gas (NYSE:NOG) dedicates its efforts to the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas assets. As gleaned from its online presence, the company’s operational focus is on the premier basins across the U.S.Considering the present political climate and its implications for the energy sector, Northern Oil appears well-positioned to cater to the heightened demand, staking its claim as one of the stocks to buy now.While NOG mirrored the underwhelming performance of many oil companies earlier in the year, its trajectory since July has been decidedly bullish. Even with its recent stock appreciation, NOG’s valuation metrics hint at an intriguing bargain.It trades at a mere 5.1x forward earnings, providing a competitive edge against 68.77% of its counterparts. Impressively, NOG boasts a 3.03x trading multiple against operating cash flow, juxtaposed against a sector median of 4.84x.On the dividend front, Northern Oil’s forward yield of 3.8% should attract attention. A conservative payout ratio of 19.18% assures investors of the company’s dividend reliability. As for Wall Street’s perspective, analysts confidently rate NOG a strong buy, forecasting a price target of $47.11, pointing to an upside of over 17%.Riley Exploration Permian (REPX)Big industrial oil tanks in a refinery base. Oil stocks., CEI stockSource: OlegRi / ShutterstockVenturing into the more speculative realms of oil stocks to buy now, Riley Exploration Permian (NYSEAMERICAN:REPX) is, in essence, a play tailored for the daring investor. With its exploration and production efforts centered in the prolific Permian Basin, REPX seems primed to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for hydrocarbon resources.A glance at its financials reveals certain red flags. Riley’s lean cash-to-debt ratio of 0.02x underscores its indebtedness. Additionally, an Altman Z-Score of 1.9 teeters on the brink, vacillating between a company under distress and one in murky waters. However, looking past these concerns reveals a silver lining.Boasting a three-year revenue growth rate that eclipses 90.67% of its peers and a net margin surpassing 91.5% of its industry counterparts, REPX’s financial foundation seems resilient. Even more enticing, its forward earnings multiple sits at a modest 4.08x, undercutting 84.76% of its peers.Riley’s dividend narrative also warrants attention. A forward yield of 4.38% slightly outpaces the industry average, and an ultra-conservative payout ratio of 14.35% bolsters confidence in its dividend sustainability. Echoing this sentiment, Neal Dingmann from Truist Financial flags REPX as a buy, pinning a $49 price target on the stock, which implies a hearty 62% upside.Vaalco Energy (EGY)oil stocks: stacks of oil barrelsSource: ShutterstockTo be blunt, Vaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY) might be the most audacious pick among our list of oil stocks to buy now. As its corporate dossier reveals, Vaalco delves deep into the realm of hydrocarbon exploration, a segment that’s recently seen a spike in demand, largely driven by evolving climate perspectives and geopolitical machinations.What makes EGY particularly captivating is its relative inertia this year, especially when compared to its sector peers. This static performance potentially signals an imminent uptrend, a possibility further buttressed by some sparkling financial metrics. A glance at its books reveals a three-year revenue growth rate of 54.2%, dwarfing 93.58% of its industry counterparts. Even more impressively, its EBITDA surged by 73.4% over the same period, outpacing 92.24% of peer entities.When it comes to valuation, EGY presents an intriguing narrative. It’s trading at a forward earnings multiple of just 2.86x, significantly undercutting the sector’s median of 8.11x. While ultra-low multiples can sometimes be red flags, Vaalco’s robust growth dynamics, combined with the overarching industry momentum, make EGY an enticing gamble.As for dividends, Vaalco touts a forward yield of 5.73%. With a payout ratio of a mere 17.9%, it’s a testament to the company’s financial prudence. Tapping into analyst sentiments, the consensus on EGY leans towards a moderate buy, with a projected price target of $8.06, hinting at a near doubling of its current market value.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

With security becoming a key selling point for connected cars, automakers are increasingly seeking related technologies. This is one of the reasons behind the quick advancement of the driver-assistance system market. Demand for personalization, infotainment connectivity and convenience are increasing rapidly. Added features require more wiring inside vehicles.Aptiv PLC Price Aptiv PLC PriceAptiv PLC price | Aptiv PLC QuoteWe believe that with excellent system integration expertise, Aptiv is well-positioned to leverage the growing electrification, connectivity and autonomy trends in the automotive sector.The company’s ""smart architecture"" provides a competitive advantage and should help it continue gaining market share. Decreasing environmental impact and increasing fuel economy are the key industry trends. OEMs have increased their search for better engine management and lower power consumption. Aptiv intends to take advantage of this trend as its “smart architecture” reduces wiring requirements in cars, helping them become fuel-efficient and add features.The 2022 acquisition of Wind River expanded Aptiv’s position in the automotive software solutions market. Another 2022 acquisition, Intercable Automotive Solutions, strengthened APTV’s position as a global leader in vehicle architecture systems. Aptiv intends to continue making investments for organic and inorganic growth. Since it acquires a large number of companies on an ongoing basis, the integration of these companies generates cost synergies, which improve the efficiency of the combined company.Story continuesFavorable Estimate RevisionsThe direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.

As a black person, you have a choice: conform or leverage your distinct viewpoint.”Being able to communicate these unique perspectives clearly and with conviction is among the soft skills needed by professionals hoping to succeed in the media industry, Demuren adds.This may involve stepping out of your comfort zone, which Demuren actively encourages.Story continues“I started my career in advertising at a creative agency, and I remember throwing myself into the process of pitching ideas to clients, again and again. It was terrifying but very exciting – and that’s how I started to feel confident in my abilities,” he says.Demuren has since launched LinkedIn’s Big Minds Collective, an online forum for leaders in media and advertising to share new ideas, strategies and perspectives.“The sector has made progress over the years, but we have a long way to go to close the inclusivity gap. My advice for young black professionals starting their career: The ad industry is craving for talent and innovation, so embrace your uniqueness,” he says.Charlene Gravesande started her career at Sky as a production runner in 2008 and is now an assistant producer - Black British Business AwardsFellow finalist Charlene Gravesande also encourages the next generation of black professionals to always unapologetically stay true to themselves.The Sky Sports assistant producer says: “I would tell my younger self that she should never be afraid to use her voice and stand up for what she believes in, even if she is the only voice doing so.”Fresh out of university, Gravesande started her career at Sky as a production runner in 2008. She recalls feeling “extremely intimidated” by her first job interview at the broadcaster and suffering from imposter syndrome.“When I arrived in Sky 15 years ago, I didn’t see many people that looked like me whether on screen or in post production, and I felt that immense pressure to get the job,” she says.Gravesande has since worked alongside the Sky Sports F1 team during its Bafta-winning coverage of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2021.She was also named as the 2022 Gamechanger in Sport at the Great British Businesswoman Awards in January, just months after returning to work after recovering from a post-traumatic stress disorder.“There’s still an immense stigma in regards to mental health and the portrayal of mental illness in the media remains negative,” she says. “I want people to recognise that those with mental health struggles can have successful careers and can be award winners.”Having recently joined the broadcasting union Bectu’s Black members’ committee, Gravesande hopes to increase opportunities across the sports media industry for underrepresented communities.“I’m hoping the next generation don’t have to feel that pressure of being the “only” in these working environments. My hope is that those following me, can enjoy going for an interview at a large corporation and live in the moment rather than having the weight of an entire community resting on their shoulders,” she says.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Senior Analyst Laura Martin explains how strikes could impact the volume of content that streaming services produce. “Wall Street is demanding they.. move to profitability faster,” Martin says. For streamers, this could mean cutting down seasons by filming fewer episodes—“less content spending”, as Martin notes. Martin expects consolidation in the industry, which will help “get rid of duplicative costs.”In regards to smaller streamers, Martin states that due to large competitors such as Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) “there’s no advantage to being small.”For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Laura, how well are we able to measure the correlation between new programming and subscriber growth? And have we already started to see-- it's probably a little early. Have we started to see any kind of uptick or indication that there are some cancelations coming because, oh, people are saying my new show is not going to come for a while?LAURA MARTIN: So, I think, what we heard from Disney last week, because we were in Orlando with Bob Iger, the CEO, and what he said was, look, we're going to make lower cost, fewer episodes, for our streaming platform, and actually, also films. He's like, we're going to do more sequels, and we're going to have fewer numbers of Marvel and ""Star Wars"" and princesses. So I do think all of these companies that have been losing money in streaming, I think Wall Street is demanding they start-- they move to profitability faster, which means we're going to have less content spending.To their credit, writers got minimum numbers of credit per series, but the number of series is about to go down because all these streamers need to make money. Because now they're raising capital at a 7% cost, and it used to be, two years ago, 0% cost. So Wall Street's screaming, they have to have a return on capital higher than 7% now. So they're going to make fewer shows.Story continues- I go back five years in time, I remember when Disney, for instance-- I don't know if it was five years ago, but we had all these new players in the market. And people started talking about peak content. It seems that moment has passed. And then we're in this new phase where there's a lot more competition for those production dollars. Who do you see as the winners emerging here? And do you see any kind of-- any more kind of a consolidation?LAURA MARTIN: Yes, I do see I think we have to consolidate because, basically, growth is zero. And the only way to grow earnings per share is you have to buy something and then you have to sort of get rid of duplicative costs, and that grows your earnings per share for 2 or 3 years while you get rid of positions that are duplicated in a consolidation. So I do see more consolidation.And I also see the big get bigger, and the small are disadvantaged. If you look at the like the public companies in streaming, like Curiosity Stream, Chicken Soup for the Soul, Fubo, there's no competitive advantage to being smaller when you're going up to-- when you're competing against Netflix, and Disney, and Comcast, and Amazon, and Apple. Like there's just no advantage to being small anymore. This has become a land of giants. And so you sort of need to merge or get the heck out of the way because you're going to get stomped on.]"

The hydrocarbon energy market offers compelling narratives, having undergone an impressive metamorphosis. During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, demand for these assets waned significantly. Fast forward to today, and hydrocarbon energy prices have surged, making them worthy of consideration.Two factors lie at the heart of this resurgence. First, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, under the OPEC+ banner, have extended oil output cuts through 2023. This decision squeezes supply, driving up prices.Second, as highlighted by Bloomberg, political pressures and changing industry priorities have deterred energy companies from adding oil capacity. Instead, a shift toward chemicals and new materials is evident.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSuch dynamics, while troublesome for consumers, could be music to the ears of savvy investors. Let’s delve deeper into the most promising oil stocks to buy now.Chevron (CVX)Chevron Earnings: CVX Stock Sinks Amid Spending CutsSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAs a vertically integrated oil and gas powerhouse, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) covers the entirety of the energy industry’s value chain. From upstream operations in exploration and production to midstream storage and transportation, and down to downstream refining and marketing, Chevron has it all. Though it may not be the flashiest pick among stocks to buy now, there’s a reassuring stability to CVX.Boasting a robust balance sheet, Chevron’s equity-to-asset ratio sits at an impressive 0.63x, outperforming 67.4% of its industry counterparts. In terms of financial performance, the company has shown consistent long-term revenue growth and commendable net margins.While the Covid-19 pandemic did pose challenges, Chevron’s history of profitability remains intact. Its forward earnings multiple of 11.68 might seem a tad pricey, but in exchange, investors are backing an incredibly stable entity.Story continuesAdditionally, Chevron’s dividend game is strong. It offers a forward yield of 3.62%. Though slightly below the sector average, it’s hard to overlook the company’s track record of 37 consecutive years of dividend increases. Market analysts label CVX as a moderate buy, setting their sights on a price target of $192.92, suggesting an upside potential of nearly 16% in the coming year.Enbridge (ENB)Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comStepping into the realm of multinational pipeline and energy companies, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is an essential pillar for the nation’s infrastructural framework. The company’s crude oil system stretches an extensive 17,809 miles, underscoring its relevance. Yet despite its significance, ENB has faced challenges in the market.However, the tide may soon turn for Enbridge, positioning it as a potential candidate among stocks to buy now. While there are legitimate investor concerns — like Enbridge’s hefty debt reflected in its cash-to-debt ratio of 0.01x and declining revenue growth — demand dynamics could be the game-changer. Basic supply-demand principles point toward a potential uptick.In terms of valuation, ENB’s forward earnings multiple stands at 17.39x. On the brighter side, the company boasts a healthy operating margin of 19.48% and has maintained profitability over the past decade. When it comes to dividends, Enbridge’s forward yield of 7.55% is eye-catching.But potential investors should also consider its high payout ratio of 127.07%. Still, analysts lean toward a moderate buy recommendation for ENB, eyeing a price target of $40.92, indicating possible 17% upside.Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDiving into the midstream and downstream sectors of the hydrocarbon value chain, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) seems poised for positive momentum, especially within its marketing business unit. As communities gradually emerge from the shadows of the Covid-19 pandemic, we’re witnessing a surge in roadway traffic, which should inevitably amplify demand at Phillips 66’s gasoline stations.What investors get with Phillips 66 isn’t necessarily a financial dynamo but rather a steady performer. Take its Altman Z-Score of 4.1, for instance — it suggests a firm financial footing.Value hunters might see PSX as a potential entry among stocks to buy now, given its compelling metrics. A notable three-year revenue growth rate of 14.9% is paired with a trading multiple of just 5.25x on trailing earnings, placing it at a competitive advantage against 73.15% of its peers.Further sweetening the deal, Phillips 66 offers a forward dividend yield of 3.51%. Although this might trail the sector’s average, a modest payout ratio of 31.93% reinforces confidence in dividend sustainability. The analyst community, for its part, slates PSX as a moderate buy, projecting a price target of $131.64, which hints at 7.5% upside potential.Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the behemoth in the oilfield services domain, takes pride in being both the world’s premier offshore drilling company and its top offshore drilling contractor by revenue. Though SLB’s performance this year has left some investors wanting, a noticeable uptrend since early July suggests a shift in sentiment.The prospect of further upside makes SLB a contender in the list of stocks to buy now. Granted, its financials have been wobbly — with the pandemic leading to a downturn in its three-year revenue growth. However, a revived thirst for oil has kindled demand for Schlumberger’s services. The latest sales metrics underscore a marked improvement in the company’s top line.From a valuation standpoint, SLB’s forward earnings multiple of 16.65x might seem steep. However, with the oil sector catching a positive tailwind, this premium could be more palatable than prohibitive.Although the forward dividend yield of 1.66% may not turn many heads, a supremely low payout ratio of 27.29% offers reassurance. Drawing insights from market analysts, SLB receives a strong buy recommendation with a price target set at $67.91, suggesting a potential upside of more than 12%.Northern Oil and Gas (NOG)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comSpecializing in exploration and production, Northern Oil and Gas (NYSE:NOG) dedicates its efforts to the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas assets. As gleaned from its online presence, the company’s operational focus is on the premier basins across the U.S.Considering the present political climate and its implications for the energy sector, Northern Oil appears well-positioned to cater to the heightened demand, staking its claim as one of the stocks to buy now.While NOG mirrored the underwhelming performance of many oil companies earlier in the year, its trajectory since July has been decidedly bullish. Even with its recent stock appreciation, NOG’s valuation metrics hint at an intriguing bargain.It trades at a mere 5.1x forward earnings, providing a competitive edge against 68.77% of its counterparts. Impressively, NOG boasts a 3.03x trading multiple against operating cash flow, juxtaposed against a sector median of 4.84x.On the dividend front, Northern Oil’s forward yield of 3.8% should attract attention. A conservative payout ratio of 19.18% assures investors of the company’s dividend reliability. As for Wall Street’s perspective, analysts confidently rate NOG a strong buy, forecasting a price target of $47.11, pointing to an upside of over 17%.Riley Exploration Permian (REPX)Big industrial oil tanks in a refinery base. Oil stocks., CEI stockSource: OlegRi / ShutterstockVenturing into the more speculative realms of oil stocks to buy now, Riley Exploration Permian (NYSEAMERICAN:REPX) is, in essence, a play tailored for the daring investor. With its exploration and production efforts centered in the prolific Permian Basin, REPX seems primed to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for hydrocarbon resources.A glance at its financials reveals certain red flags. Riley’s lean cash-to-debt ratio of 0.02x underscores its indebtedness. Additionally, an Altman Z-Score of 1.9 teeters on the brink, vacillating between a company under distress and one in murky waters. However, looking past these concerns reveals a silver lining.Boasting a three-year revenue growth rate that eclipses 90.67% of its peers and a net margin surpassing 91.5% of its industry counterparts, REPX’s financial foundation seems resilient. Even more enticing, its forward earnings multiple sits at a modest 4.08x, undercutting 84.76% of its peers.Riley’s dividend narrative also warrants attention. A forward yield of 4.38% slightly outpaces the industry average, and an ultra-conservative payout ratio of 14.35% bolsters confidence in its dividend sustainability. Echoing this sentiment, Neal Dingmann from Truist Financial flags REPX as a buy, pinning a $49 price target on the stock, which implies a hearty 62% upside.Vaalco Energy (EGY)oil stocks: stacks of oil barrelsSource: ShutterstockTo be blunt, Vaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY) might be the most audacious pick among our list of oil stocks to buy now. As its corporate dossier reveals, Vaalco delves deep into the realm of hydrocarbon exploration, a segment that’s recently seen a spike in demand, largely driven by evolving climate perspectives and geopolitical machinations.What makes EGY particularly captivating is its relative inertia this year, especially when compared to its sector peers. This static performance potentially signals an imminent uptrend, a possibility further buttressed by some sparkling financial metrics. A glance at its books reveals a three-year revenue growth rate of 54.2%, dwarfing 93.58% of its industry counterparts. Even more impressively, its EBITDA surged by 73.4% over the same period, outpacing 92.24% of peer entities.When it comes to valuation, EGY presents an intriguing narrative. It’s trading at a forward earnings multiple of just 2.86x, significantly undercutting the sector’s median of 8.11x. While ultra-low multiples can sometimes be red flags, Vaalco’s robust growth dynamics, combined with the overarching industry momentum, make EGY an enticing gamble.As for dividends, Vaalco touts a forward yield of 5.73%. With a payout ratio of a mere 17.9%, it’s a testament to the company’s financial prudence. Tapping into analyst sentiments, the consensus on EGY leans towards a moderate buy, with a projected price target of $8.06, hinting at a near doubling of its current market value.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(AMGN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-amgn-trending-stock-130007003.html,1695646807,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +4.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has lost 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.68 per share, indicating a change of -0.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.35 points to a change of +3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.92 indicates a change of +8.5% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Amgen, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.26 billion and $31.01 billion estimates indicate +3.6% and +13.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $5 for the same period compares with $4.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.41%. The EPS surprise was +12.61%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.9%, 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. For the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, it was the largest weekly percentage fall since March.The Fed turned hawkish after its September meeting, and chairman Jerome Powell indicated that he expects at least another hike by year-end. The general suggestion was that the policy required further tightening because the current level of inflation still needs to be brought down to the Fed’s 2% target. Investor optimism took a hit, and trade suffered through the week.The treasury yield also hit a 16-year high, and whether the central bank could attain a soft landing for the economy is up for debate again. However, some good news came from the automobile sector with a breakthrough in talks between the Big Three automakers and the striking UAW representatives.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:Elementis and Boise Cascade Surge Following Zacks Rank UpgradeShares of Elementis plc ELMTY have gained 21.7% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 2.1% decrease) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on July 12.Another stock, Boise Cascade Company BCC, which was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on July 11, has returned 7.2% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 1.4% decrease) since then.Zacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. This stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Story continuesA hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks has returned +10.8% this year (through July 3) versus +16.1% for the S&amp;P 500 Index and +7.7% for the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 Index. The set of Zacks Rank #1 stocks is an equal-weight portfolio, while the S&amp;P 500 Index is a market-cap-weighted index that has been notably distorted by the strong recent performance of mega-cap stocks.We are not trying to cherry-pick here. But since this Zacks Model portfolio, consisting of Zacks Rank # 1 stocks, is an equal-weight portfolio, the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 Index is the appropriate benchmark for comparison.Check Elementis’ historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Check Boise Cascade’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Recommendation Upgrade Drives Sabre and Samsonite HigherShares of Sabre Corporation SABR and Samsonite International S.A.

However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform.

The S&amp;P's 500 gains are being led by energy stocks. That group is up to date even as oil prices are falling, and energy stocks have underperformed the underlying commodity this year. In other words, it hasn't been sort of neck and neck between the two. Let's talk to an investor who likes one oil stock in particular.Ken Mahoney, Mahoney Asset Management Chief Executive Officer is back with some picks here. And let's start with that oil stock, Ken. It is ExxonMobil. And it has been an interesting ride for these oil stocks. They've been performing very well this quarter, but they haven't necessarily kept pace with the gains that we've seen in the underlying commodities. So why are you looking at Exxon?KEN MAHONEY: Yeah, your math is correct. Actually, we went sub $70 a barrel a couple of times now. So from 70 to 90 something, yeah, it's like 27%, 28% increase in the underlying oil. And of course, Exxon didn't go up that much altogether. But you know, look, we are mostly growth managers. We like technology, but we're trying to find some positions outside of technology should they falter, should evaluations come in a little bit.Story continuesYou know, it seems like there's a $70 put somewhere there. Every time we go down there, Saudis come up and say, hey, we're going to cut a million barrels a day. And they've done that twice. So I think investors can feel comfortable there's some type of downside. When you invest, it's always risk and reward.And I think for investors, they kind of know the downside is something low $70 a barrel. Exxon pays a 3.5% dividend. You can see the kind of chart there, again, made a nice move after being choppy most of this year. But I think it's a good way to invest outside of tech as a way to get a decent dividend, more of a value play. And hopefully, there is that put, which I believe there is, in the low 70s.JARED BLIKRE: It seems like it's been energy or tech. But I want to talk about another field, consumer discretionary. You're also talking about McDonald's, which you like. And I want to go to the YFi Interactive here. Just looking at the year-to-date chart, it is off of its highs here, record highs. But on a 10-year basis, you can see maybe it's just come down to the lower end of its channel here. I'm talking technicals. What do you like about the fundamentals here?KEN MAHONEY: So the fundamentals are interesting. It's always one thing to say, oh, technology is going to help a company. With McDonald's, it's really amazing what they've done here. They have kiosks now if you've gone into McDonald's. And you can order kiosks. And it's a nice environment. It's a screen and so forth. And they found that people that actually go on there onto the kiosk spend maybe 20% or 30% more than if they wait in line.You go up on line and you kind of look up. And you're kind of [INAUDIBLE] and then you move over because people are waiting and so forth. But the kiosk is very interesting. Not everybody's going to order in kiosk. It's not going to be everything there. But the look of those numbers. And again, we can't extract 20% growth because of the kiosk.But that's, again, when you try to find a catalyst, what's going to bring the stock back near your highs, I think technology. They've really taken a big bite into technology. And I think it's really-- again, it could be one of the discretionary consumers, as you said. That's kind of a sleeper. Everybody knows the name, it's McDonald's. But again, that kiosk could be a game changer.JULIE HYMAN: And let's talk about stuff that you don't, Ken. And we start here with Macy's. Now, I think you're not alone on this one. This has not exactly been a loved name. But it has come back to some extent. And we were just talking in a segment a few minutes ago about going into the holiday season here. Why should investors steer clear of Macy's?KEN MAHONEY: Well, the management guidance even told us. We like companies that beat estimates and raised guidance. And they actually lowered their guidance. And you think about, if you're going to be in retail, if you had to pick one out, it wouldn't be Macy's. And think about Prime Day for Amazon. They did $12.7 billion of revenues in one day, July 12, and July 14.And then you look at Macy's, the entire year, they do about $25 billion in revenues. So basically, one day in Amazon is about six months of selling there in Macy's. So I think it's a pretty big difference. Again, I think stocks that make new lows continue to make more lows. So I think technically, it's kind of trapped, lower guidance. And if you're going to a retailer, why even be around Macy's when you have companies like Amazon that in one day do half to revenue they do in the entire year.JARED BLIKRE: All right. I also want to talk more broadly about US small caps. And for that, we're looking at the Russell 2000 or the IWM ETF. And I want to pull up the YFI Interactive one more time just to show the choppiness that we have seen this year. We've seen a couple of highs here. And we are marching back down to the lows. And in fact, if we look over the last three years, maybe we're just going sideways over the last two. What are you seeing in the small cap space?KEN MAHONEY: I'm seeing that the lot of nervous investors. We are in a narrow market, whether we like it or not. We always tend to underweighted, so S&amp;P 500, and then put in Apple, Microsoft, and all them, and kind look at the difference. Look, investors are still very nervous. They want big, liquid stocks. And small caps don't fit that definition. So for us to get a rally, I think first is to be led by those tech names, Microsoft after having a really difficult August, September.The leadership, I believe, is going to come back to Apple, Microsoft, all those leaders that happened before this mess. And before we get to small caps, it's going to take some time. So I think most money is going to go into liquid names, big names. Hopefully, they carry the day with good earnings coming up in the third, fourth week in October. And really I think small caps right here is really an afterthought.JULIE HYMAN: All right. We'll see what happens. Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, thanks. Good to have you here.KEN MAHONEY: Great. Thanks.]"

M has been bearing the brunt of tough macroeconomic trends, softness across its credit card portfolio, supply chain constraints and rising operating costs and expenses.The current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) player has a market capitalization of $3 billion. In the past three months, M has lost 28.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 12%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s discuss the factors that might continue to affect the firm’s performance in the near term.Soft Operational Performance: Macy's has been grappling with waning consumer confidence and a pullback in spending activity, which is reflected in its second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance. In the quarter, the company’s comparable sales fell 8.2% on an owned basis and 7.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis on a year-over-year basis. Its digital sales dropped by 10% and brick-and-mortar sales declined by 8% in the same period.Weakness in the company’s credit card segment owing to an increased rate of delinquencies within the credit card portfolio has been impacting its top-line performance of late. On its second-quarter earnings call, the company highlighted that it expects the softness to persist in its credit card portfolio throughout the fiscal year and affect its top-line performance.Tepid Fiscal 2023 Outlook: In regard to the tough operating landscape, Macy's provided a cautious view and reaffirmed its annual sales and earnings outlook. For fiscal 2023, it anticipates its net sales in the range of $22.8-$23.2 billion, down from $24.4 billion reported in fiscal 2022. Comparable owned plus licensed sales on a 52-week basis are expected to decline by 6-7.5%. For the fiscal year, adjusted earnings per share are envisioned in the band of $2.70-$3.20, down from $4.48 earned in the last fiscal year.For the fiscal third quarter, it expects net sales to be $4.75-$4.85 billion, down from $5.2 billion in the year-ago fiscal quarter. The bottom line is envisioned in the range of a loss of 3 cents per share to earnings of 2 cents. The metric represents a significant decline from adjusted earnings of 52 cents in third-quarter fiscal 2022.Rising Costs &amp; Expenses: The company has been witnessing rising operating costs and expenses over time. For instance, in the first six months of fiscal 2023, its selling, general &amp; administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased by 0.3% year over year to $3,930 million. As a percentage of net sales, the metric increased by 310 basis points to 38.9%.Any deleverage in expenses, unless fully offset by sales, may have a direct bearing on margins and, in turn, the bottom line. For fiscal 2023, the company’s SG&amp;A expenses are expected to be about 36.4-36.7% of net sales.Southbound Estimate Trend: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 and 2024 earnings have been revised downward by 4.4% and 9.7%, respectively.Story continuesKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the Retail-Wholesale sector are Amazon.com, Inc.

Daco, the chief economist at EY and a frequent guest on Yahoo Finance Live, said the autoworkers strike, a government shutdown, and resumption of student loan payments could together create a “significant drag on growth in the fourth quarter.”Now, there’s a new threat to contend with: Oil prices have soared by around $20 a barrel in the past six months. That means prices at the pump are about 20% higher now than they were at the beginning of the year, according to AAA.But fret not, say some analysts and economists. While higher oil prices could indeed trim GDP, it’s a “manageable headwind.” That’s the framing from the economics team over at Goldman Sachs, which is cutting its fourth quarter growth forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 0.7%.JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli says the pain could be a bit more acute, trimming GDP growth by half a percentage point annualized, but wouldn't be ""large enough to threaten the expansion by itself.""Goldman’s Jan Hatzius &amp; Co. (this particular note is credited to Spencer Hill) put the oil price rise into perspective, comparing it to bigger spikes in 2008 and 2022.These spikes may be big, but still out of the danger zone. In a note from DataTrek, hedge fund veteran Nicholas Colas wrote that the price would have to double before it would really cause a problem.“History shows they must double in a year or less before a recession is inevitable. That makes the warning track $140/barrel,"" Colas wrote, adding that history says that ""oil price spikes matter much more than modestly rising prices.""Of course, nothing exists in a vacuum, and oil prices have gone up in tandem with Daco’s other threats rearing their heads. As my colleague Brian Sozzi points out, citing RBC’s Lori Calvasina, markets don’t react well to government shutdowns, an event that could happen next week.Story continuesAs for the other threats, economists have largely gamed out the hits to economic growth from the auto strike and student loan repayments.There are a lot of modest headwinds, and one way to look at them is that they could also add up. The oil supply cuts, JPM noted, could ""interact with a combination of other modest negative US shocks"" like ""an escalation of the UAW strike, a government shutdown or the recent rise in US long-term interest rates.""Macro effects aside, the higher oil prices do prompt a lingering question for investors: Which companies will be most affected? One answer to that question came today in the form of Jefferies downgrading Nike to Hold, citing the impact from student loans.“Most US consumers with student debt are concerned about meeting all their monthly expenses (87%) and that apparel/accessories and footwear are likely to be areas of reduced spending ahead,” wrote analyst Randal Konik.Presumably, those monthly expenses also include the price of gas.morning brief imageClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
91,a411da2a-afa5-308e-8195-2aef75653d93,NOV,2023-09-26,Why Now Could Be a Good Time to Invest in Oil and Gas,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-now-could-good-time-094035322.html,1695721235,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F']","[Demand for energy is strong and supply has gotten low, and while clean energy is making strides, it’ll take a while before it dominates. Here are three ways to invest in oil and gas.With all due respect to Charles Dickens, the oil and gas sector is increasingly a tale of two markets. Depending on where you focus, it is the best of times, and it is the worst of times.For the past few years, professionals in the oil and gas industry have expressed their dissatisfaction with the state of the sector. The use of oil and gas has diminished, and prices have proven volatile due to the global slowdown caused by COVID-19.The world economy has somewhat recovered, resulting in a banner year for oil majors in 2022. However, fears of an imminent recession coupled with stagnant natural gas prices, rising costs of production and a particularly acute economic slowdown in China have restrained any palpable sense of optimism for some.Not to mention…ESG carries the day. The fossil fuel industry is under sharp focus due to the rise of prominence in ESG (environmental, social and governance) standards. ESG advocates have already achieved substantial progress toward their overall goal to get pensions, banks, insurance companies and endowments not only to shed their existing holdings in public oil equities, but also to shun new investments in drilling and exploration. The ESG movement has successfully shifted growth from fossil fuels to renewables, as we will explore shortly.Inflation marches on. Exploration of new oil and gas fields has become more expensive due to external factors like inflation, resulting in rising costs. Inflation numbers are certainly trending in a more optimistic direction than they have been over the last two years, but there is only talk of “pausing” interest rate increases in the U.S., not of stopping them entirely or even reversing them.The world is an unstable place. Furthermore, the industry has faced an additional challenge due to geopolitical uncertainties. The war in Ukraine plods on, disrupting oil and gas supplies from Russia, resulting in higher prices in the European nations that rely on Russia for a significant portion of their energy.Story continuesSince China is the world’s second-largest consumer of oil and gas, its economic struggles continue to dampen demand and present significant impacts on the global oil and gas market. And across the globe, concerns about climate change have resulted in significant regulatory barriers for fossil fuels and increased subsidization of the clean energy industry poised to at least partially replace them.Now seems the perfect time to reconsider Warren Buffett's advice to be greedy when others are fearful. Fear is clearly carrying the day in the oil and gas industry. However, let's examine what reasons might exist for investing in oil and gas.Reasons for investing in oil and gas1. Demand for energy is strong and getting stronger.The world may one day be headed toward a future where electric cars replace conventional ones, biomass heating replaces traditional heating, and coal usage is eliminated, but this transition will not occur overnight.Even if car companies make good on their pledge to produce only electric vehicles by 2035, it will take decades to transition away from fossil fuels. And by all accounts, the demand for energy is growing by the day.The world's energy may be getting cleaner, but it is not yet entirely clean. Despite the world's wishes, it will still require a significant amount of oil and gas for the foreseeable future, which presents an issue, because...2. The supply of energy is low and will take a while to recover.As previously mentioned, the rising costs and falling prices are discouraging the industry from investing heavily in drilling. Although the market hasn't shown it yet, the decreasing oil and gas supply will pose problems in meeting global energy demands. No amount of wishful thinking about green energy replacing fossil fuels will address this situation in the short term, regardless of the long-term future of renewables.3. The law of economics remains intact.Put simply, an increase in demand for a limited commodity does not necessarily mean the end of the oil and gas industry, despite the desires of ESG advocates.In his recent white paper on the future of energy, John Mauldin, a noted financial expert, economist and visionary thinker, pointed out that the ESG movement unintentionally reduced energy supply, leading to spiking energy prices in the face of increasing demand. However, no responsible country is likely to advocate against their citizens’ needs for power and clean water, both of which require oil and gas, making a compelling case for medium- and long-term energy prices.Add it all up, and opportunity may be knockingSo the oil and gas sector appears to be ripe for new investment. Now comes the tricky part: How best to invest in this opportunity?Generally speaking, most oil and gas investors tend to confine themselves to traditional energy investments in the stock market, buying shares in integrated oil companies like Fortune 500 stalwarts ExxonMobil and Chevron, or in MLPs that store and transport oil and gas to refineries. These stocks tend to be conservative, reliable dividend payers and can certainly reward patient investors over the long run, particularly if the shares are bought in an IRA or other tax-sheltered investment.And while there’s nothing wrong with that approach for most people, sophisticated investors would do well to take a close look at three ways to invest in the oil and gas sector. All three investments take into account three universal truths of investing:First, the ideal investment minimizes risk while maximizing returnSecond, the ideal investment does not exist, and our goal is simply to come as close as possible to that idealThird, taxes are the silent killer of any investment and should always be in the crosshairs of any investment philosophy, including these three timely and tantalizing oil and gas investmentsThree ways to invest in the oil and gas sector1. Mineral rightsRecall John Mauldin’s observation that the ESG movement appears to be succeeding in reducing supply exactly as demand continues to increase. Nowhere is this phenomenon more evident than as we examine mineral rights, a concept on the lower end of the risk spectrum of the three ideas I am outlining.Historically, generational wealth has been created through mineral rights, which involves the ownership and subsequent leasing of land to oil and gas drillers and operators, who develop and produce wells. Landowners thus have a royalty interest in the land, but no responsibility to undertake its development directly.Some of the institutions and funds that have been owners of these rights for decades are now under pressure to comply with ESG-friendly board members to divest of as much as possible of their hydrocarbon-based assets. These assets include land located in some of the most energy-rich basins in the country. As these funds sell some of their best-performing assets, mineral rights funds are perfectly positioned to scoop them up, building their portfolios with timely purchases that are likely to increase in value over the next several years.Mineral rights funds have tremendous appeal to savvy oil and gas investors with an approximately five- or six-year time horizon. They are capable of producing instant cash flow, which is likely to increase over time as the number of productive wells within the fund increases, with a goal of double-digit cash flows. There is also tremendous capacity for capital gains, as most funds operate with the goal of developing their properties and ultimately selling them to generate further returns.Finally, because mineral rights are investment properties that are eligible for 1031 exchanges, which can shield investment returns from capital gains taxes indefinitely when properly structured, the funds may well be eligible for preferred tax treatment, either on the way in or the way out… or both. It’s important to note that investors can use a 1031 exchange to move funds from a realized investment gain into a mineral rights fund, but they are not required to do so; mineral funds can be purchased with cash as well as through a 1031 exchange.2. Oil and gas drilling fundsFor investors who are less concerned with income and more interested in potential tax benefits as a precursor to possibly larger capital gains, drilling funds might provide an excellent opportunity.Drilling funds can provide a massive tax advantage on the front end of the investment, with a tax write-off of up to 80% to 90% of the value of the investment.The deduction, which is actually for the intangible drilling costs, or IDCs, represents the cost of exploring and drilling oil and gas wells, which are deducted in the year they are incurred. IDC deductions offset ordinary income, so that a $300,000 investment in a drilling fund might enable an investor to lower their taxable income by as much as $270,000 in the year the investment is made.In addition, subsequent depletion allowances permit investors to deduct a portion of the value of their oil and gas reserves each year, even if they do not sell any oil and gas. The amount of the deduction is based on the type of the property, the production level and the cost of the property. This could be as high as 15% of the gross income from the property, though the amount is impacted by both the taxable mineral income from the property as well as the taxpayer’s overall gross income. Depletion allowances are phased out based on gross income, so the input of a qualified tax adviser is essential.3. Qualified opportunity funds in the energy sectorA qualified opportunity fund (QOF) investment addresses one of investors’ primary concerns (capital gains taxes) without sacrificing its focus on the other (investment returns). By using a realized gain to fund a QOF investment, investors can defer the tax on that gain until Dec. 31, 2026. More important, they can avoid paying taxes on the QOF investment itself simply by holding it for a minimum of 10 years. The ability to defer a current gain and avoid a future one entirely represents a generational opportunity that higher-net-worth investors should take seriously.By selecting an investment in one of the many QOFs that are located in areas of the country that specialize in energy exploration and production, savvy oil and gas investors can position themselves to take advantage of the outstanding 10-year prognosis for the industry.Whatever may be true of the death of fossil fuels in America and the world, our short- and medium-term future as a society is inextricably linked to the continued availability of oil and gas and their related products. Clean energy’s future may be bright, but the bridge between our present and that future is linked to a robust oil and gas industry that appears to see strong demand for the foreseeable future.It goes without saying that investment gains are never guaranteed. Also, it is true that the exploration and production (E&amp;P) division of the oil and gas sector is one of the most speculative. But it's also true that investments in QOFs rely on guidance from teams of experts with knowledge of the energy industry and qualified opportunity fund structures. Accredited investors willing to take risks and work with expert advisers can gain exposure to what many consider to be one of the most important asset classes of our time.related contentQualified Opportunity Zones With an Energy BoostTax-Smart Strategies for Capital Gains in 2023Opportunity Zones in 2023: A Look Back, a Look ForwardKeeping Property in the Family with LLCs and PartnershipsWhat Assets Should You Put (or Not Put) in Your Trust?]"

If you wish to skip our discussion on the infrastructure industry, head directly to 5 Best Infrastructure ETFs.As noted by Deloitte, significant changes in the economy, along with the transition to remote work and telemedicine, are causing noteworthy effects on infrastructure. Traditional physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and power systems is undergoing a transformation, becoming increasingly digital. This shift places an emphasis on technologies like broadband, self-driving vehicles, and intelligent infrastructure. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on environmental considerations and broader societal advantages that are influencing the infrastructure sector's evolution. Deloitte's report highlights key findings regarding how governments worldwide are shifting their infrastructure investments to adapt to changing trends. Notably, respondents believe that technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity will exert the most significant influence on infrastructure projects. AI and machine learning, in particular, are expected to have a substantial impact, with 55% of those surveyed expressing this view. As governments transition towards more digitally-oriented infrastructure, there is a growing concern about cyber risks. A significant majority, 76% of respondents, expect a heightened focus on data security over the next few years. Moreover, there is a noticeable demand for green infrastructure, with 60% of those surveyed expressing intentions to invest in urban spaces designed for walking, cycling, socializing, and dining.Also Read: 12 Best European ETFs to BuyPwC highlighted that the infrastructure sector faced significant changes globally, driven by factors like the availability of funds, evolving social and environmental concerns, and rapid urbanization. COVID-19 introduced new challenges and its full impact will take time to unfold. In the short term, it will reshape the industry in four ways – increasing focus on operational resilience, affordability, the adoption of new technologies, and sustainability. Successful infrastructure projects require collaboration among various stakeholders, each with their own interests and agendas.Story continuesIn 2022, the infrastructure sector remained resilient, even in the face of market challenges, according to UBS. Ongoing trends like digitalization and decarbonization will continue to drive the need for new investments. However, the overall economic conditions have significantly deteriorated. Investors can no longer rely on cheap credit to boost their investment returns. Moving forward, they must adopt a more strategic approach to investment and asset management to achieve positive outcomes. Inflation has drawn considerable attention to private infrastructure investments. This asset class has gained a reputation for its ability to stand strong in inflationary situations, mainly because it can adjust prices effectively and pass on higher costs to customers. Its defensive characteristics make it particularly appealing when times are uncertain, serving as a safe haven for investors. Performance data from 2005 to 2021 shows that private infrastructure investments performed better than public ones, especially when inflation was higher than usual. This performance difference became even more obvious when inflation was high and economic growth was slow. It is likely for the trend to continue through 2023, given that private markets had already outperformed public markets in the first half of the year.Don't Miss: 10 Best Mid-Cap Growth ETFsSimilarly, J.P. Morgan's insights underline the strength and versatility of core private infrastructure investments. They seem to perform well regardless of economic cycles, highlighting the importance of diversifying investment portfolios. Similar trends are expected to continue throughout 2023. Katarina Roele, PhD, stated:“Significant attractive investment opportunities in core private infrastructure remain due to the structural tailwinds of the need to modernize, replace and decarbonize existing assets.”The global economy is grappling with challenges such as a recession, monetary tightening, rising living costs, and disruptions in various markets. Inflation is anticipated to remain high throughout the year, and this, along with labor shortages and pricing pressures, might pose challenges for plans involving significant construction and growth strategies. The global economic outlook suggests that we can expect slower, and in some cases, even stagnant growth in the near future. Many countries are heading towards recessions at a rapid pace. In this scenario, assets that do not generate much immediate cash flow and rely heavily on long-term growth or high exit values may face challenges. On the other hand, assets with a significant portion of their revenue coming from contracted or regulated sources, along with terms linked to inflation, are likely to fare better in this tough economic climate.In this article, we discuss some of the best infrastructure ETFs, which offer investors exposure to companies like Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH).Our MethodologyWe used an ETF screener and filtered out the best infrastructure ETFs based on their 5-year performance.

(Cboe), today announced the upcoming launch of the Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index (Dispersion Index or DSPX), the first-of-its-kind to measure the expected dispersion in the S&amp;P 500 Index.S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices logo (PRNewsfoto/S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices)Dispersion1 is a fundamental measure of risk and opportunity in the marketplace. It measures how differently stocks are performing or are expected to perform. As a complementary measure to market volatility – which measures overall fluctuations in stock averages like the S&amp;P 500 Index – dispersion measures stocks movements relative to each other.Similar to the way that the Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX® Index) represents implied volatility of the S&amp;P 500 Index, this new volatility-related index is designed to represent the expected dispersion in the S&amp;P 500 Index over the next 30 calendar days. In practice, and upon its planned launch on Wednesday, September 27, DSPX aims to offer market participants another tool for further understanding opportunities for diversification as well as risks within the world's most liquid equity benchmark.""The launch of DSPX reinforces the S&amp;P 500's ongoing strength as the best single gauge of the U.S. equity market and its highly liquid ecosystem,"" said Tim Edwards, Global Head of Index Investment Strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. ""S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices is pleased to collaborate with Cboe to provide the marketplace with one, standardized statistical measure of S&amp;P 500 dispersion. Just as the VIX Index grew the volatility market, we believe a transparent and accurate measure of 30-day forward expectations will do the same for dispersion.""Using a modified version of the VIX Index methodology, a rigorous and transparent approach to providing a market expectation for the implied 30-day volatility in the S&amp;P 500 Index, DSPX is calculated from the prices of S&amp;P 500 index options and the prices of single stock options of selected S&amp;P 500 constituents. By integrating the VIX methodology into the Dispersion Index, S&amp;P DJI and Cboe hope to facilitate greater transparency and improve market participant's understanding of this broad-based security index's methodology.Story continues""Cboe and S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices have a long-standing history of collaboration and share a common vision to continually innovate and offer solutions that benefit a diverse range of investors,"" said Rob Hocking, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Innovation at Cboe Global Markets. ""Our latest creation, the Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index, builds upon our collective expertise in developing and managing financial market indices — many of which have become some of the world's most trusted benchmarks. We believe that the new DSPX index will be a valuable addition to our S&amp;P volatility toolkit, providing another tool to help investors more effectively navigate the complexities of the equity markets.""Like other volatility-based indices, such as the VIX Index, but unlike indices based on equity or fixed income securities, the Dispersion Index is not expected to display a long-term trend for growth. Instead, the Index is anticipated to show a degree of mean reversion - returning from highs or lows to a more ""normal"" level. The ""normal"" level to which the index returns to may drift somewhat over time with the prevailing market conditions and mix of securities included in the S&amp;P 500 Index.S&amp;P DJI and Cboe collaborated to develop and launch DSPX. S&amp;P DJI is the benchmark administrator and Cboe is the calculation agent.

The DSPX is designed to provide deeper insights into U.S. equity market volatility by measuring the expected dispersion in the S&amp;P 500 Index over the next 30 calendar days.The new index will complement existing volatility measures of equity markets. Dispersion, which measures how differently stocks are performing or expected to perform, allows investors to model the impact of company-specific risk on a portfolio. This is achieved by measuring the variability of volatilities for single-name stocks relative to the volatility of the index itself.Rob Hocking, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Innovation at Cboe, expressed confidence that the DSPX will provide investors with an additional perspective into market volatility, supplementing other volatility indices in their product suite. He also highlighted Cboe's unique position as a global exchange operator with unparalleled product innovation expertise.The DSPX is calculated using a modified version of the VIX Index methodology, derived from prices of S&amp;P 500 Index options and the single stock options of the S&amp;P 500 Index's constituent companies. The index aims to help investors better understand how the S&amp;P 500 Index moves relative to its constituent companies.In addition to launching the DSPX, Cboe Labs plans to develop a futures product on the index to be listed on the Cboe Future Exchange. This move could potentially enable investors to manage their exposure and express views on SPX dispersion or transfer risk between SPX options and options based on the underlying S&amp;P 500 Index constituents.Cboe and S&amp;P DJI are also scheduled to host a webinar on the new DSPX Index and the potential benefits of dispersion trading on Wednesday, October 4. Furthermore, the new index will be discussed at Cboe's Global Risk Management Conference (RMC) taking place from October 17-20, 2023, in Austin, Texas.Story continuesThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The revision has shortened the post-IPO waiting period for options trading from four sessions to a mere two.This change was notably observed in several major IPOs this month. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) PLC, Maplebear Inc. (also known as Instacart), and Klaviyo, Inc., all began options trading just two days after their shares started trading. This is a significant shift from the previous rule that required a longer waiting period.The rule modification underscores the increasing importance of options trading in capital markets. Since 2019, volumes of options contracts have doubled, becoming an essential component of both institutional and retail investment strategies. The changes are expected to offer investors deeper insights into market sentiment, which could assist them in navigating the typically volatile early days of a stock's trading.Investors have been quick to leverage this new rule. For example, Instacart saw approximately 23,000 options contracts traded on its second day of share trading. These contracts were evenly split between calls, betting on a stock rise, and puts, predicting the opposite. Arm Holdings experienced even more activity with three times the volume of Instacart on its first day of derivatives trading, predominantly driven by bearish bets. Klaviyo saw less activity with an open interest close to 1,000 contracts on its first day, despite possessing a market capitalization similar to Instacart.The revision in rules marks a significant evolution in the trading landscape as it allows investors access to data previously unavailable during a company's initial days of trading.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Even though the ""troubling dynamics"" the firm thought might develop, did as Windows has continued to struggle and Azure has struggled, the firm notes that incremental traction in the Office business due to the cumulative impact of price increases a year ago and renewals have been partially offsetting this.Wedbush upgraded CarMax (KMX) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $90, up from $85. The firm says the company is near an inflection point in growth and market share performance while its profitability continues to improve on ""enduring"" retail strength and fixed cost leverage. Citi upgraded Steel Dynamics (STLD) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $130 as it believes U.S. flat rolled prices will rebound into year-end and steel company valuations are ""relatively attractive.""

Citi also upgraded Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $22.Jefferies upgraded AstraZeneca (AZN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $80, up from $66.50. The company's assets outside oncology ""are being largely ignored, offering significant upside optionality,"" the firm says.JPMorgan upgraded Dow Inc.

While ""impressed"" with the company's second quarter results, rising milk prices and the potential of consumers trading down in a recessionary environment lead the firm to ""take a more conservative approach to valuation.""Bernstein downgraded BHP Group (BHP) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $58, down from $60. With iron ore over $120 per ton, BHP's risk/reward is ""not skewed to the positive,"" the firm tells investors in a research note.

While the firm likes Instacart's competitive position in online grocery and attractive profit margins, lack of conviction on growth re-acceleration and growing competition keeps Wolfe on the sidelines.

The firm sees U.S. clean hydrogen production capacity accelerating on the back of billions of dollars in federal stimulus. Needham initiated coverage of Upstart (UPST) with a Hold rating and no price target.

The company reassured that while some downsizing measures are scheduled for the fiscal fourth quarter, these would not result in a widespread reduction of the workforce.In August, Qualcomm had warned of a potential decline in smartphone sales and possible job cuts. This warning was followed by an announcement during its fiscal third quarter earnings call ended June 25, where President and CEO Cristiano Amon expressed a conservative view of the market. Amon emphasized that Qualcomm would be ""proactively taking additional cost actions to ensure it is well positioned to deliver maximum value for stockholders in an uncertain environment"".The company's recent financial performance mirrored these concerns. Qualcomm reported revenues of $8.4 billion in the fiscal third quarter, marking a 23 per cent year-over-year drop.

In the second quarter of 2023, smartphone sales in China declined by 4% compared to the previous year. This drop was attributed to economic challenges that negatively impacted consumer sentiment, leading to the lowest second-quarter sales figures since 2014.In an August stock exchange filing discussing its quarterly revenue, Qualcomm noted its anticipation of 'workforce reductions' as part of broader restructuring efforts. The company mentioned that it aims to facilitate ongoing investments in critical growth and diversification endeavors, given the persistent macroeconomic and demand uncertainties. Their latest financial report revealed a substantial year-over-year drop in revenues, standing at $8.4 billion — a 23% decline, coupled with a significant 52% decrease in net income to $1.8 billion.The company also maintains an R&amp;D presence in Beijing and over a dozen other Chinese cities for its semiconductor and mobile telecommunications ventures. The impending restructuring measures are anticipated to incur significant additional costs for Qualcomm but are seen as necessary steps to navigate through the industry’s challenges.Story continuesFurthermore, Qualcomm is not alone in its downsizing efforts in China. Other US chip companies have been reducing their workforce in the country as well. For instance, in March, California-based Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology announced the complete closure of its research and development team in mainland China in response to an industrial downturn. This move came approximately five months after the company initiated job cuts to streamline its operations in the country.Qualcomm has stated that it will provide attractive severance packages to all the affected employees as part of its restructuring process.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with LRCX. Click here to check it out. LMT 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LMTAs of 2023-09-25, Lockheed Martin Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $520.58. It's currently trading at a price of $413.65. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 20.54%. The company is modestly undervalued.Lockheed Martin Corp: A Deep Dive into Its Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Lockheed Martin Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$27.35GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.5%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 12.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=296.15Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=224.44Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=520.58Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $665.69. This valuation indicates that the Lockheed Martin Corp is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 37.86%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

124,052bcf03-ea8d-3abd-9007-ca76185d1aeb,PHM,2023-09-26,The End of Policy Rate Hikes? Global Week Ahead,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/end-policy-rate-hikes-global-133200470.html,1695648720,STORY,['PHM'],"[A market moment most stock traders waited for finally arrived.Last week, major central banks spoke to the trading world.To communicate formally: They are near the end of policy rate hikes.At the end of this Global Week Ahead, for those developed economies?Fresh personal consumption data — from the U.S. and the Euro Area — sheds light on how progress is going, slowing personal consumer price inflation down with steep monetary policy rate hikes.In the emerging world, India’s domestic debt enters a JP Morgan (JPM) bond index.Meanwhile, smaller Southeast Asian central banks wrestle with a currency dilemma.Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) The Fed’s PCE measure of inflation is out on Friday, Sept. 29th.The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge lands on Sept. 29th, right after the central bank signaled it plans to keep interest rates higher for longer to tame price pressures.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 3.3% in the 12 months through July. The Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for its 2% inflation target.In its latest decision on Wednesday, the Fed kept interest rates steady, but projected monetary policy will remain significantly tighter through 2024 than previously expected.Investors will also be watching events in Washington DC, where U.S. lawmakers are haggling over a spending bill with a Sept. 30 deadline to avert a potential government shutdown that could rattle markets.(2) Eurozone consumer price data is out on Friday, Sept. 29th, too.The European Central Bank has not called time on its battle against inflation, but markets are laser-focused on when it might. That means Eurozone consumer prices data on Sept. 29th has the potential to move markets significantly.Headline inflation in the euro area remains far above the ECB's 2% target but has been moving in the right direction.Consumer prices increased by 5.2% year on year in August, extending a downward trend that started last autumn.The ECB raised its deposit rate to a record 4% this month and revised up its inflation forecast for next year.But with the currency bloc's economy weakening, the central bank also hinted a pause, at least, was coming. A further decline in inflation will undoubtedly spur intense speculation about the timing of its first rate cut.(3) What happens to global oil prices? Is $100 a WTI barrel here shortly?After what has felt like a relentless period of cost-of-living crisis and rising interest rates, central banks are finally wrestling inflation into submission. Or so they thought.Oil prices — a major inflation variable that lies beyond the control of any policymaker — has risen above $90 a barrel to 10-month highs, serving an unpleasant reminder that what goes down can also easily go up again.The key driver has been Saudi Arabia and Russia, which account for over 20% of global output, agreeing to extend production cuts through year-end, to align supply with demand.Most analysts agree the oil price would, in theory, have to remain higher for longer to really push up headline inflation. But the predictions of $100 oil are becoming louder. Central banks may not yet be able to declare the war on inflation over.(4) India joins the benchmark JP Morgan EM domestic bond index.India finally got the nod from JP Morgan to join its benchmark GBI-EM emerging market domestic bond index, which is followed by $236 billion of funds.The decision will draw billions of dollars into domestic fixed-income markets of the world's fifth largest economy, with official inclusion due in increments from July 2024 until India reaches the 10% mark.India began talks on including its debt in global indexes in 2019, but that ambition had been delayed by a number of factors, including its stance on capital gains taxes and local settlement.Its government bond markets — in which foreigners currently hold less than 2% of outstanding paper — could get another boost when fellow index provider FTSE Russell decides on Sept. 28th whether to add India to its emerging bonds benchmark.(5) Southeast Asia’s central bank currency dilemma.Asian central banks have a dilemma: how to handle weakening economic growth and peaking inflation, while arresting the slide in currencies to maintain stability in their financial systems.The Bank of Indonesia kept rates steady for an eighth month on Thursday. Benign inflation might have argued for a cut, but Governor Perry Warjiyo emphasized currency stability was a deciding factor. The rupiah is at six-month lows and its yield premium over U.S. dollars has shrunk.The same day, the Philippine central bank prioritized support for the peso over economic growth running at its slowest in nearly 12 years in the second quarter, with a hawkish pause.The Bank of Thailand meets on Sept. 27th and is likely to stay hawkish, forced by the beleaguered baht, despite wide twin deficits and a struggling economy.Heavy currency-market intervention has been one tactic. But much may rest on decisions of other central banks further afield, namely the Federal Reserve.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks(1) Live Nation Entertainment LYV: This $80 a share stock in the Leisure and Recreation industry has a $18.8B market cap.

This should be the most influential macro report.On Monday, the latest monthly German IFO index updates are out. In September, Business Climate rests at 85.7, Current Assessment is at 89, and Expectations is at 82.6.On Tuesday, the U.S. S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index (HPI) comes out. For July. Their national composite HPI is at -1.2% y/y now.U.S. New Home Sales data also come out. I see a call for 0.7M in August, similar to the prior 0.714M.On Wednesday, the U.S. census supplies its Durable Goods orders, ex-transportation, for August. I see +0.5% m/m was the July mark.On Thursday, U.S. Pending Home Sales for August come out. The y/y reading is at -14%.We get a final revision on U.S. Q2 GDP. This rests at +2.1% now.For a reference: The Sept. 19th Atlanta Fed GDPNow Q3 estimate is at 4.9%.On Friday, at 8:30 am ET, U.S. core PCE for Q2 should be +3.7% y/y, lower than the prior mark at +4.2%.The Eurozone’s core harmonized indices of consumer prices (HICP) for September come out too. I see a prior composite reading at +5.3% y/y.The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for September also comes out. I see a call for 66.3, after last month’s 67.7.ConclusionIn closing, keep this in mind. It is not a solid analytical idea to compare the U.S. core PCE data with Euro Area measures of harmonized consumer price inflation (HICP).They are differently constructed index animals, with different end goals.So, how can you frame up Europe’s current consumer inflation situation?Use these official Sept 19th, 2023 facts from Eurostat:“The euro area annual inflation rate was +5.2% in August 2023, down from +5.3% in July. A year earlier, the rate was +9.1%.”“European Union annual inflation was +5.9% in August 2023, down from 6.1% in July.

126,5dcf0eee-b95b-3942-a60d-3bbe24739fbb,MDT,2023-09-26,These 4 Measures Indicate That Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-measures-indicate-medtronic-nyse-140011120.html,1695650411,STORY,['MDT'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Medtronic What Is Medtronic's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at July 2023 Medtronic had debt of US$24.9b, up from US$23.2b in one year. However, it also had US$7.88b in cash, and so its net debt is US$17.0b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Medtronic's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Medtronic had liabilities of US$9.05b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$30.4b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$7.88b and US$5.81b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$25.7b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.This deficit isn't so bad because Medtronic is worth a massive US$106.8b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Medtronic's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.0 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 46.2 times, makes us even more comfortable. Sadly, Medtronic's EBIT actually dropped 7.4% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Medtronic can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Medtronic generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 85% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewMedtronic's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But truth be told we feel its EBIT growth rate does undermine this impression a bit. We would also note that Medical Equipment industry companies like Medtronic commonly do use debt without problems. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Medtronic is pretty sensible with its use of debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Medtronic has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

On the other hand, the LEAP-008 study evaluated Keytruda plus Lenvima as a second-line therapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose disease progressed on a combination of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/-L1 immunotherapy.The LEAP-006 and LEAP-008 studies also did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in objective response rate (“ORR”), a key secondary endpoint in both studies.Neither Merck nor Eisai updated whether the companies will continue to develop the drug in the two NSCLC indications. The full evaluation of data from both studies is ongoing. The companies intend to share the results.Merck’s shares have lost 4.2% year to date against the industry’s 5.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Keytruda plus Lenvima combination is currently approved in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries for treating advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) and certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma.Merck and Eisai are studying this combination through the LEAP clinical program across various tumor types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer and esophageal cancer, across multiple clinical studies.The setbacks in LEAP-006 and LEAP-008 are one of the many setbacks suffered by Merck and Eisai on the Keytruda/Lenvima combination. Last month, both companies announced the closure of the phase III LEAP-010 study on Keytruda plus Lenvima combo as a first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“HNSCC”). Data from the study failed to show an overall survival benefit for patients.Story continuesIn April, Merck and Eisai discontinued another phase III study called LEAP-003, evaluating Keytruda/Lenvima combination for the first-line treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Patients treated with the combination did not improve OS, one of the study’s dual primary endpoints, versus Keytruda alone.Alongside the LEAP-003 update, Merck and Eisai also announced that the phase III LEAP-017 study, evaluating Keytruda plus Lenvima for treating patients with unresectable and metastatic colorectal cancer, did not meet its primary endpoint of OS.Merck and Eisai plan to continue to study the combination of drugs for other indications under the LEAP program.In a separate press release, Merck, along with partner Seagen SGEN, reported positive top-line results from a late-stage study (KEYNOTE-A39/EV-302) of the combination therapy of Seagen’s Padcev with Keytruda for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC). The Seagen/Merck partnered study achieved its co-primary endpoints of OS and PFS.The FDA approves the Seagen/Merck drug combination for the above indication under the accelerated pathway. The Seagen/Merck conducted KEYNOTE-A39/EV-302 study intends to serve as a confirmatory study seeking to convert the accelerated approval to a full one.Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global diabetes industry and the larger pharmaceutical industry in 2023, go directly and see 5 Best Ways to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes is directly responsible for more than 280,000 deaths each year. As fast food consumption and obesity levels reach an all time high, the global diabetes market is projected to adapt accordingly. With a significant increase in the global diabetic population, technological advancements, and rising adoption rates in emerging regions, the global diabetes industry is projected to reach more than $118 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 6.67% during the forecast period. According to an article by Bloomberg, over 1.3 billion people globally are projected to have diabetes by 2050, causing patients to look for the best ways to prevent type 2 diabetes. Some of the biggest players in the insulin industry are Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT).Don't Miss: 20 Most Addictive Foods According to Science.The Rise of Digital Therapeutics: An AnalysisAs the burden of chronic diseases like diabetes exacerbate the economic crisis globally, the challenges have created a requirement for comprehensive disease management solutions. Since chronic conditions like diabetes are largely untreatable and need to be managed through lifelong medication and care, disease burdens at a population level are higher than they need to be. The need to integrate digital technologies with biotech seems to be more pronounced than ever as one of the best ways to prevent type 2 diabetes. According to an article by McKinsey, global digital health funding increased by more than 79% compared to 2022 to reach $57.2 billion in 2023. Much of this funding  has largely been reserved for digital therapeutics, which include numerous points of intervention along the patient's journey, comprising of monitoring, medication, adherence, behavioral engagement, personalized coaching, and real time custom health recommendations. Funding for digital therapeutics has grown at a massive scale - nearly 134 percent up from 2022 to reach nearly $9 billion in 2023.Story continuesAccording to another study by McKinsey, digital therapeutics offer pharmaceutical companies access to new sections of the healthcare value chain and an opportunity to operate in the much larger, more lucrative end-to-end healthcare market. Incumbent pharmaceuticals already have some inherent advantages in that they already boast direct access to patients, intrinsic knowledge of pain points in the disease management journey, and profound experience with providing some of the best ways to prevent type 2 diabetes. However, for a successful infiltration into the digital therapeutics market, pharmaceutical companies may need to recruit or upskill employees with skills in product development, design, data science, and strategic partnerships. They should construct five year plans to build on their digital capabilities and affiliate their new digital workforce with the culture, vision, mission and values to compete against start-ups. Companies which adapt quickly will have first-mover advantage, which is why investors are flocking to stocks like Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), which have diverted significant investment in rewiring their technology, tools, and operating models to realize their digital and analytics ambitions in 2023. To read more on companies which have integrated digital technology in their product portfolio, read our article on 11 Best Digital Technology Stocks to Buy.The Insulin Pumps Market: An AnalysisIn 2023, according to a survey conducted by Tandem Diabetes Care, more than 94% of insulin pump users recorded positive results and an improved quality of life due to insulin pump therapy. According to a report by Acumen Research and Consulting, the insulin pump market has been recording strong growth, driven by the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes, technological advancements pertaining to digital therapeutics, and favorable reimbursement policies. As of 2023, the global insulin pump market is estimated to rise from $5.1 billion in 2022 to more than $11.4 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 8.5%.There are multiple growth drivers influencing the positive outlook of the insulin pump market, the foremost being the rising global prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the subsequent increase in insulin users. Owing to the overwhelmingly positive response to insulin pumps over traditional syringe injection as one of the best ways to treat type 2 diabetes, physician recommendations have also begun to skyrocket. Furthermore, with companies like Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) dominating the insulin pump market, the availability of advanced, easy-to-use insulin pumps is a fundamental growth driver.Furthermore, according to an article by McKinsey, technological advancements in digital therapeutics are also resulting in improved credibility and efficiency of the insulin pumps available in the market. The integration of advanced features like CGM connectivity, smartphone applications for data tracking, enhanced user interfaces, and predictive algorithms for incredibly precise insulin delivery are driving market revenue growth to unprecedented levels. Furthermore, consumers are increasingly moving towards customization and personalization within the insulin pumps market. Many companies are now allowing for personalization based on the individual's unique lifestyle, insulin needs, and activity levels.Photo by Matt C on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 10 best ways to prevent type 2 diabetes, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of third-party, peer-reviewed studies and surveys. We primarily limited our approach to government data (1, 2, 3) and academic sources (1, 2) to compile our list. Then, we identified 30 common recommendations and strategies which are consistently mentioned across various reputable sources and expert opinions. Next, we established an evidence based criteria for inclusion in the list: frequency of recommendation (5 points), strength of scientific evidence (4 points), effectiveness (3 points), feasibility (2 points), and relevance to type-2 diabetes (1 point). We then proceeded to score each recommendation according to the aforementioned criteria and selected ten recommendations which scored the highest points. If there was an entry which was recommended by one source but rejected by another, we discarded it; it did not make our list. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the frequency of recommendation.To read about the obesity epidemic in the United States and its close interrelation with late onset diabetes, check out our coverage of the 30 Most Overweight and Obese Cities in the U.S. in 2023.Best Ways to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes10. Optimize Vitamin D LevelsInsider Monkey's Score: 5One of the best ways to prevent type 2 diabetes  is to optimize the vitamin D levels in the body. Studies show that maintaining adequate levels of Vitamin D helps in blood sugar management, which subsequently aids patients with prediabetic orientations. Thus, doctors are now suggesting patients increase their intake of vitamin D to prevent type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D intake can be carried out not only through food sources, like fatty fish and cod liver oil, but also via sun exposure and supplements prescribed by a doctor. 9. Increase Water IntakeInsider Monkey's Score: 6To prevent type 2 diabetes, it is advisable to substitute sugary and sweetened drinks with water. One study conducted by the National Institutes of Health found that consumption of one serving of a sugary drink may increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes by 18%. On the other hand, water intake helps with blood sugar management and maintaining insulin levels. A recent study by the CDC showed that overweight people who followed a comprehensive diet plan and replaced sweetened drinks with water experienced decreased levels of insulin resistance and fasting blood sugar. 8. Quit SmokingInsider Monkey's Score: 6Smoking can not only contribute to diseases like heart disease or lung cancer, but is also linked as a precursor to type 2 diabetes. People who smoke have a higher chance of experiencing insulin resistance. In fact, people who smoke more are increasingly prone to type 2 diabetes, as compared to those who smoke less. In a study conducted by Harvard, it was found that the risk of diabetes in smokers decreases over time after they quit smoking. 7. Reduce Sedentary BehaviourInsider Monkey's Score: 7Reducing sedentary behavior can significantly reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. One study suggests that those who have 10 hours of sedentary time per day are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes, as compared to those who have a nominal 8.3 hours of sedentary time. Sedentary behavior can be changed with minor adjustments, like standing up for a while or taking short walks. According to Harvard, it is important to set achievable goals in order to cut sedentary behavior.6. Reduce Alcohol ConsumptionInsider Monkey's Score: 9Alcohol consumption is often linked with a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Alcoholic drinks contain exorbitantly large amounts of calories, which can not only lead to obesity but eventually lead to diabetes as well. Additionally, heavy drinking may also increase insulin resistance, which exacerbates chances of developing late onset diabetes. Thus, many studies suggest that reducing alcohol consumption can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes to a great extent. Reducing alcohol consumption ranks number 6 on our list of the 10 Best Ways to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes.

This comes on the heels of stimulus measures initiated by China's central bank, including an unexpected interest rate cut and reduction in banks' reserve requirements to encourage lending.Despite a slow start to the year with retail growth crawling at a mere 2.5% in July, official data indicates a rebound in August, with retail sales growth bouncing back to 4.6%, significantly above the anticipated 3%. Similarly, industrial productivity increased by 4.5%, up from July's slower pace of 3.7%. Consumer prices also rebounded last month following alarming deflation in July.UBS Group's head of China strategy, James Wang, suggests that there are indicators that the equity market may have reached its lowest point and reasons for optimism are emerging. Amid these developments, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and Trip.com are gaining attention.Alibaba Group Holding has managed to increase its revenue by 14% year over year in the quarter ending June despite challenging economic conditions. Although analysts predict a slowdown in the growth rate for the latter half of this year, projected full-year revenue growth of 9% is still noteworthy. Alibaba shares are currently trading at just over eight times next year's expected per-share profits.Alibaba's new CEO, Eddie Wu, brings a fresh vision to the company, emphasizing user-centricity and AI-driven strategies.

136,63a1d297-ecaf-3508-b3ee-8c1aad5c808e,BA,2023-09-26,UPDATE 3-Air France-KLM says it plans to buy 50 Airbus A350 jets,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-air-france-klm-says-180200173.html,1695664920,STORY,"['AF.PA', 'AIR.PA', 'AC.TO', 'EADSY', 'AFLYY', 'BA']","[(Adds closing shares)By Tim HepherPARIS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Air France-KLM said on Monday it plans to order 50 Airbus A350 long-haul jets, together with purchase rights for an additional 40, in its largest-ever wide-body purchase as the Franco-Dutch group revamps its long-haul fleet.The provisional deal includes both the A350-900 and the larger A350-1000 models, and the aircraft will be delivered between 2026 and 2030, the group said after its board backed the deal, estimated to be worth several billion dollars.It follows a tight contest between Airbus and Boeing supported by engine makers, as the airline's fleet planners juggled range, size and cost to find replacements for Airbus A330 jets and most of the group's older Boeing 777s.The Air Current, an industry publication, reported earlier this month that the airline was closing in on an order for 50 wide-body jets and that one factor was the range involved in skirting Russian airspace amid ongoing Ukraine war sanctions.""We are taking the assumption that the ban on Russian overflights is with us for at least the mid-term,"" CEO Ben Smith told reporters after announcing the order.Smith said the A350 had won on either range or size compared with their 787 equivalents given the specific shape of the post-Ukraine network, while the larger Boeing 777X had yet to be certified and would not be available in the time required.However, he said Air France-KLM would look at the 400-seat twin-engined jumbo to replace its Boeing 777-300ER long-haul jets which would continue to fly through this decade.Asked about widespread production delays, Smith said Air France-KLM had considered splitting the order between Airbus and Boeing but had benefited from competitive prices by sticking to one supplier and would still have a diversified fleet.Shares in the group earlier closed down 3.7% amid weaker travel stocks.FLEET FLEXIBILITYAir France-KLM, the product of a 2004 merger between French and Dutch national carriers, said the deal would give it flexibility to allocate aircraft among its brands based on market or regulatory conditions.Story continuesThat includes the possibility to shift jets to any carriers it may buy, Smith said. Air France-KLM is among potential suitors for the upcoming privatisation of Portugal's TAP.It also leaves open the possibility that capacity could be withheld from Amsterdam's Schiphol where the airline is locked in a dispute with the Dutch government over flight curbs.""If certain jurisdictions where we have operations become non-viable, or the return expected in the business case is no longer possible, (that) may force us to put them elsewhere,"" Smith said when asked about such operational restrictions.The purchase is the latest stage of a sweeping renewal and simplification of the 500-strong fleet carried out under Smith since he joined the group from Air Canada in 2018.It comes weeks after Airbus was stung by British Airways owner IAG's decision to place a top-up order for Boeing 787s, following what industry sources described as a rift over support prices with A350 engine supplier Rolls-Royce.Airbus and Rolls-Royce have both declined comment.At Air France-KLM, in-house maintenance arms have repair partnerships with General Electric, the leading engine supplier for the 787. To win the deal and open the door for Airbus, Rolls had to overcome that apparent advantage for Boeing, Smith said.""Not easy as you can imagine. However, we've already ordered 41 (A350s) so Rolls is quite familiar with us,"" he added. (Reporting by Tim Hepher Editing by GV De Clercq, Mark Potter and Deepa Babington)]"
137,ac137dce-4ada-324f-8c73-b5726f8cdcc3,BA,2023-09-26,Air Canada cancels Boeing order for 777 freighters,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-canada-cancels-boeing-order-160953596.html,1695658193,STORY,"['AC.TO', 'BA', 'ACDVF']","[Air Canada operates two factory-built Boeing 767-300 freighters (pictured) along with four converted freighters of the same type. (Photo: Air Canada)Air Canada has canceled an order with Boeing Co. for two factory-built 777-300 freighters, opting to pump the brakes on the rapid expansion of its new freighter fleet amid an 18-month recession in airfreight that has sharply slashed the company’s cargo revenue.Air Canada (TO: AC) said Monday it will no longer take delivery of the 777 cargo jets in 2024. The disclosure was part of an announcement that Air Canada has ordered 18 Boeing 787-10 passenger aircraft. Air Canada said it decided to convert the order for freighters to 787s instead.No reason was given for the change of heart with the freighters. Air Canada’s press office did not respond to a query about the status of the 777 freighter deal. But the cancellation demonstrates how difficult conditions in the logistics sector are impacting operators and forcing changes in investment plans. It also reflects the strong recovery in international air travel that is expected to continue.Air Canada said the 787-10s will be used to replace less efficient widebody aircraft, with the first deliveries expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.Air Canada currently operates 30 787-9 and eight 787-8 versions of the Dreamliner, with two more 787-9 aircraft scheduled for delivery from a previous order. The 787-10 is the largest model of the Dreamliner family; it can carry more than 330 customers depending on the seat configuration and has 6,187 cubic feet of cargo volume.Air Canada Cargo currently operates six medium widebody freighters. Since launching a dedicated cargo airline in January 2022, Air Canada has deployed four used Boeing 767-300 passenger jets retrofitted to carry cargo containers and in May received two production 767-300 freighters directly from Boeing. A conversion house is expected to deliver one more 767-300 by the end of the year. Three more aircraft are scheduled to be converted next year, bringing the fleet to 10 aircraft by the end of 2024.Air Canada’s cargo revenue declined 33% in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2022. Other airlines have experienced revenue declines in excess of 50%. Air Canada set a record of $1.2 billion in cargo revenue in 2021, with a 15% decline in 2022 to $935 million. Management opted to invest in a freighter division after experiencing high demand for cargo transport during the COVID crisis, when passenger services were mostly grounded and aircraft were temporarily flipped to cargo duty.Story continuesBut the air cargo market has experienced a significant decline since the spring of 2022. Airfreight volumes in the first half of 2023 were 8% lower than the prior year, according to the International Air Transport Association, and are currently down 3% year over year as the slide in demand has levels off. The price of shipping goods by air is 40% to 50% less than a year ago, research groups say.There have been remarkably few casualties from the freight recession so far, but the prolonged downturn in business is beginning to have a deeper impact on capital expenditures.Western Global Airlines in August filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection and Cargojet, an all-cargo operator in Canada, is selling three Boeing 777s it acquired in the secondary market with the intention of converting them to freighters. Vietnam Airlines pulled out of a deal with Air Transport Services Group to convert two of its Airbus A321 narrowbody aircraft into freighters. And aerospace companies that specialize in converting aircraft say new orders have dried up this year.Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.RECOMMENDED READING:Orders for freighter aircraft slow ‘to a trickle’New Air Canada freighters help offset declines in cargo revenueWait for airfreight recovery could extend well into 2024The post Air Canada cancels Boeing order for 777 freighters appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company's cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives.Amazon.com's strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.

The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the second quarter, this jet giant booked 460 net commercial airplane orders and recorded a 10% hike in service revenues.A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing's growth.

142,1cf60867-846c-33b5-af31-c82d067d6130,SO,2023-09-26,10 Best Infrastructure ETFs,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-infrastructure-etfs-115050736.html,1695729050,STORY,"['NEE', 'AMT', 'CNI', 'CARR', 'SO', 'WAB', 'PH']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best infrastructure ETFs. If you wish to skip our discussion on the infrastructure industry, head directly to 5 Best Infrastructure ETFs.As noted by Deloitte, significant changes in the economy, along with the transition to remote work and telemedicine, are causing noteworthy effects on infrastructure. Traditional physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and power systems is undergoing a transformation, becoming increasingly digital. This shift places an emphasis on technologies like broadband, self-driving vehicles, and intelligent infrastructure. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on environmental considerations and broader societal advantages that are influencing the infrastructure sector's evolution. Deloitte's report highlights key findings regarding how governments worldwide are shifting their infrastructure investments to adapt to changing trends. Notably, respondents believe that technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity will exert the most significant influence on infrastructure projects. AI and machine learning, in particular, are expected to have a substantial impact, with 55% of those surveyed expressing this view. As governments transition towards more digitally-oriented infrastructure, there is a growing concern about cyber risks. A significant majority, 76% of respondents, expect a heightened focus on data security over the next few years. Moreover, there is a noticeable demand for green infrastructure, with 60% of those surveyed expressing intentions to invest in urban spaces designed for walking, cycling, socializing, and dining.Also Read: 12 Best European ETFs to BuyPwC highlighted that the infrastructure sector faced significant changes globally, driven by factors like the availability of funds, evolving social and environmental concerns, and rapid urbanization. COVID-19 introduced new challenges and its full impact will take time to unfold. In the short term, it will reshape the industry in four ways – increasing focus on operational resilience, affordability, the adoption of new technologies, and sustainability. Successful infrastructure projects require collaboration among various stakeholders, each with their own interests and agendas.Story continuesIn 2022, the infrastructure sector remained resilient, even in the face of market challenges, according to UBS. Ongoing trends like digitalization and decarbonization will continue to drive the need for new investments. However, the overall economic conditions have significantly deteriorated. Investors can no longer rely on cheap credit to boost their investment returns. Moving forward, they must adopt a more strategic approach to investment and asset management to achieve positive outcomes. Inflation has drawn considerable attention to private infrastructure investments. This asset class has gained a reputation for its ability to stand strong in inflationary situations, mainly because it can adjust prices effectively and pass on higher costs to customers. Its defensive characteristics make it particularly appealing when times are uncertain, serving as a safe haven for investors. Performance data from 2005 to 2021 shows that private infrastructure investments performed better than public ones, especially when inflation was higher than usual. This performance difference became even more obvious when inflation was high and economic growth was slow. It is likely for the trend to continue through 2023, given that private markets had already outperformed public markets in the first half of the year.Don't Miss: 10 Best Mid-Cap Growth ETFsSimilarly, J.P. Morgan's insights underline the strength and versatility of core private infrastructure investments. They seem to perform well regardless of economic cycles, highlighting the importance of diversifying investment portfolios. Similar trends are expected to continue throughout 2023. Katarina Roele, PhD, stated:“Significant attractive investment opportunities in core private infrastructure remain due to the structural tailwinds of the need to modernize, replace and decarbonize existing assets.”The global economy is grappling with challenges such as a recession, monetary tightening, rising living costs, and disruptions in various markets. Inflation is anticipated to remain high throughout the year, and this, along with labor shortages and pricing pressures, might pose challenges for plans involving significant construction and growth strategies. The global economic outlook suggests that we can expect slower, and in some cases, even stagnant growth in the near future. Many countries are heading towards recessions at a rapid pace. In this scenario, assets that do not generate much immediate cash flow and rely heavily on long-term growth or high exit values may face challenges. On the other hand, assets with a significant portion of their revenue coming from contracted or regulated sources, along with terms linked to inflation, are likely to fare better in this tough economic climate.In this article, we discuss some of the best infrastructure ETFs, which offer investors exposure to companies like Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH).Our MethodologyWe used an ETF screener and filtered out the best infrastructure ETFs based on their 5-year performance.

Peter Lynch’s approach garnered a 29.2% annualized return during his time and beat the S&amp;P 500 index for several years. The GARP strategy looks at companies with growth and value characteristics to ensure investors are focused on those with high valuations and consistent growth.With his renowned performance, GARP investing has become one of the most followed strategies by investors looking for that sweet spot between value and growth. S&amp;P500 has even created an index focusing on these stocks, called the S&amp;P500 GARP index. The index follows the same mantra as Peter Lynch, focusing on companies with superior earnings power, sensible valuation, impressive financial strength, and steady fundamental growth. This helps investors who want to adopt the GARP strategy easily choose stocks that fall in that category.This article will look at three of its constituents that are the best in the pack.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDevon Energy Corporation (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comAn independent energy firm, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) specializes in the exploration, development, and production of fuel products like oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas. While energy stocks have been strengthening thanks to rising oil prices, DVN is also slowly creeping up after hitting its 52-week low of $44.03 last March. Its slow descent gives investors room to buy in before it shoots up, reclaims its year high, and continues its upward trajectory.Wall Street analysts love Devon, rating the company with a “Strong Buy” recommendation and a high target of $79.00 in the next 12 months, a potential upside of around 50%. The company is poised to capitalize on the high oil demand due to supply cuts. DVN hopes to add more shareholder value as it expands its stock repurchase program. In addition, DVN dividends could potentially increase and offer shareholders higher income on the back of rising crude oil prices, making it one of the more attractive GARP stocks in the market.Story continuesCigna Group (CI)Cigna logo displayed on a modern smartphone. CI stock.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockLet’s face it: health services companies tend to be boring as some investors forget about them. That’s unfortunate because they’re missing out on some great GARP stocks like Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), which offers services that cater to the challenges of our healthcare system. These services include medical, pharmacy, dental, and behavioral product offerings like Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth Health Services. As insurance plan redemption and pharmacy benefits management grow, I expect this will translate to increased earnings.While CI’s business does sound boring to some, it makes up for it with consistent profitability. Indeed, CI’s mission is to lower medical costs, boost the company’s image, retain its current customer base, and attract new clients. The results speak for themselves: the company has consistently beaten earning expectations in the last four quarters. Not only that, Cigna’s revenues have been consistently growing, and for shareholders, the company currently pays a 1.71% dividend yield – cementing its place as an attractive GARP stock to buy.Arch Capital Group (ACGL)Arch Capital GroupSource: ShutterstockArch Capital Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACGL) is a Bermuda-based insurance company operating worldwide and focusing on specialty insurance. As a specialty insurance provider, ACGL insures specialty case properties that require unique assessment per case. The company also has a reinsurance segment that sells a portion of its exposure to other insurers to minimize its risk. Its other operations focus on mortgage and casualty &amp; professional insurance.ACGL is another stock beloved by Wall Street analysts with a “Strong Buy” recommendation and a $100.00 high estimate. Arch Capital’s earnings have also been consistently surpassing analysts’ estimates for the last four quarters. The company’s annual sales have also been growing over the previous five years and show no signs of slowing down. The industry’s favorable conditions have significantly boosted AGGL’s growth and standing in the S&amp;P 500’s GARP index list.On the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

""People will flock to it, but I wonder whether the average runner will really feel the benefit of the ultra-supershoe, versus the supershoe, or the normal shoe.""Weighing just 138 grams (5 ounces), the shoes are very light, but not durable. They're designed to be worn for a single marathon-distance race (42 kilometres, or 26 miles) and pre-race warmup, making the cost per mile at around $19 if, as Adidas says, runners must buy a new pair for each marathon.""This is a shoe optimized for speed, versus durability,"" Adidas said. The retailer released just 521 pairs of the shoes on Tuesday, with a second drop planned for November.Adidas is marketing them as world record breakers, with CEO Bjorn Gulden on Tuesday posting on his Instagram a photo of him and Assefa holding the shoe, with the caption: ""Tigist Assefa... we are so proud of you!""Assefa broke the world record by more than 2 minutes to finish in 2 hours, 11 minutes and 53 seconds.(Reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Sharon Singleton)]"

Forrester Research Research Analyst Sucharita Kodali joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what to watch from the company's results.“The challenge is... that Nike has been very dependent on the Asian market, certainly on the Chinese consumer,"" Kodali says. “Not only do you have issues with the softening of the Chinese consumer and their spending ability, but also just a lot of… geopolitical risk.""Kodali notes that “the biggest issue for a company like Nike is if there is a glut of inventory, that may potentially have an impact on whether or not the brand is as desirable because so much of the value of the most desirable products is the scarcity, not the oversupply.”For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Nike stock heading lower today following a downgrade from buy to hold from Jefferies, citing the resumption of student loan repayments next week becoming a key pain point for consumer stocks. It comes just days ahead of the company reporting earnings on Thursday. And here to discuss further is Sucharita Kodali from Forrester Research. Thank you for joining us here today.I'm wondering what you're expecting. A lot of people mentioning the student loan payments, but we also have the China story. Not sure if that's totally in the rearview mirror. What are you looking for?SUCHARITA KODALI: Yeah. I think that the China story is probably the biggest one here for Nike. The challenges is that Nike has been very dependent on the Asian market, certainly on the Chinese consumer. Not only do you have issues with the softening of the Chinese consumer and their spending ability but also just a lot of just geopolitical risk that is there. Everything from manufacturing to just whether or not there is going to be enough of a detente to allow the resumption of trade as we knew it across borders.Story continuesSo I think that's really the biggest issue for Nike since such a big part of its overall revenue mix is coming from international sources. The student loan repayment issue, I'm not as concerned for a company like Nike. They are a where consumers who want their product will find ways to purchase their product. So the student loan repayment issue has more of an impact on sectors like automotive, potentially even housing. I don't think it's going to have as much of an impact on branded apparel, to be completely candid.- Yeah. And indeed, Jefferies is the firm that downgraded the stock today in part because of what they're saying could be a hit from the student loan repayment. But something you mentioned I want to pick up on, Sucharita, and you said, if people really want it, they will find a way to pay for it. And one of the things that has been amazing about Nike for those of us who followed it for a long time has been the sustainability of its brand being hit, right? People wanting the shoes. Is that still the case in sort of a more declining economic environment? Does it still have that cachet?SUCHARITA KODALI: There are absolutely things that consumers will always want, regardless of the economic circumstances. Whether or not Nike happens to have the hottest shoes at this moment in time, I think that that is something that sneaker heads would be happy to you know to share which ones that they happen to be kind of highest on their most wanted list right now. But the truth is that it is still very much a category that consumers do want. It is still very much a category where the idea of the drop is incredibly valuable and is a big driver of demand.The biggest issue for a company like Nike is if there is a glut of inventory, that may potentially have an impact on whether or not the brand is as desirable because so much of the value of the most desirable products is the scarcity, not the oversupply. We've learned that over and over again from luxury brands, from Coach to Gucci, that when they are overdistributed, it is a big problem for the health of the brand. And Nike needs to figure out, if they do have an inventory glut, what they're going to do with that excess inventory in a way that still preserves the desirability of their highest ticket items, which are the Jordans and the Air Force 1s.]"

That morning, the the consumer confidence report will be released. On Thursday, September 28, Nike (NKE) will release its first quarter earnings. Investors will be looking to the earnings call to learn about the impact of upcoming student loan repayments on the company. The inflation gauge the Federal Reserve is closely watching will also be released this week. August PCE inflation data will be releases on Friday September 29, with expectations for a decrease in core inflation. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer discusses the week's key highlights, covering topics like the government shutdown and the ongoing strikes in Hollywood and the auto industry.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: There's a lot on tap this week. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer is here to tell us more, plus his excitement level for all of those things to come. Josh, good to see you this morning.JOSH SCHAFER: Brad, we're always fired up on a Monday morning. We know this. We know this. But we also have a big calendar too. If you take a look at the calendar that we have this week when it comes to just earnings and economic data alone, you can see it's going to be pretty busy. So you got Costco earnings tomorrow, give you a good look potentially at the consumer overall. And that's really what I have circled too when we take a look at Thursday and think about Nike. Yes, there's the Nike Stock story in it of itself, but I'm most curious, guys, because what we hear from that earnings call.Nike is going to talk a lot about what they're seeing over in China. They're going to talk about a potential consumer slowdown in the fourth quarter that we've talked about a lot. And they're probably going to talk about the return of those student loans, which is something we've been curious about and how that's going to impact the overall retail sector. And I didn't even mention retail crime, that Nike earnings call, we could have five different story angles from that alone, guys, if we wanted to have a full Nike power hour on Friday, maybe we'll come back for that.Story continuesBut then when you think about what we're seeing for economic data, you've got two looks at consumer confidence. We know that's been coming down a little bit, specifically as gas prices have been rising. So it'll be interesting to see what we hear there. And then also Friday the Fed's favorite inflation gauge comes out on Friday, guys, PCE inflation. We are expecting core PCE to come down a little bit from what we saw in July. This will be a reading on August PCE, but should be interesting to see what we hear there, and then, of course, what that means for the Fed is always sort of what we're watching.SEANA SMITH: All right. Certainly, Josh, something that we're going to keep an eye on. And then also, what about the shutdown? Because certainly conflicting reports about what this means for the economy, what this means for the market, whether or not we should be using history as a guide. What are strategists saying this time around?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Sean. It's going to be interesting with the shutdown. So the shutdown comes, of course, as we're also looking at two labor strikes. So when we're thinking about what it means for the overall economy, there's sort of several headwinds at play when you have that auto strike that economists have been flagging that could impact GDP a little bit. Then you have the government shutdown, which could also impact GDP that could start that government shutdown again on October 1st. But one interesting note I saw out over the last couple of days from friend of the program Truist, Co-Chief Investment Officer Keith Werner, he flagged that there's normally choppiness in the beginning, right.Markets are a little bit uncertain and people and markets don't really like that uncertainty. But he said in the long run, this has not been something that has weighed on stocks. So expect a little bit of choppiness in the near term. But overall, it's not something that has impacted stocks that much. And I should know Oxford Economics also said a similar thing when we're thinking about GDP. They said this is not something that is going to quote sink the economy. Of course, everyone working with the assumption that this government shutdown isn't going to be prolonged in last month's here.If that starts happening, I'm sure the projections will change. But for now, it's prepare for a little bit of waves, but I don't think we're going to get any 10 footers, anything too crazy right now.SEANA SMITH: Hopefully their forecasts are right this time around. All right. Josh, thanks.]"

The following analysis provides a deeper exploration of Ansys's value.Unveiling Ansys (ANSS)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. It indicates the fair value at which the stock should be traded. Calculated based on historical multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates, the GF Value Line provides an overview of a stock's fair value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Currently, with a market cap of $25.80 billion and a price of $297.53 per share, Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) appears to be modestly undervalued. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Unveiling Ansys (ANSS)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

The Department of Health and Human Services wrote a letter to insurers stating, ""Your obligation as a plan or issuer to ensure that your members have coverage for COVID-19 vaccines without cost sharing is not conditional upon parties' compliance.""Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the news. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: It's a new era for COVID-19 vaccines with the drug now being rolled out commercially, but several supply and insurance roadblocks are causing some confusion for people out there and also for pharmacy. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joining us now with those details. Anj, what do we need to know?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Seana. Unfortunately we're hearing reports of individuals getting denials of coverage for their COVID vaccine or running into problems when trying to get insurance coverage. And to that end, the Health Department wrote a letter to insurers on Friday asking them to make sure that these coverage requests and these claims do go through, regardless of whatever is going on internally for-- following the process.They said, quote, ""Whether the problems are directly within your organization's control or the control of your partners, your obligation as a planner or issuer is to ensure that your members have coverage for COVID-19 vaccines without any cost sharing and it's not conditional on other parties' compliance.""So saying that the insurers really do have to take the lead role here in ensuring that the government's promise to ensure free vaccines as the market first turns commercial remains in place. And to help do that, there has been some focus on exactly which covers-- which payers have which rules.Story continuesSo if you take a look at the private market, for example, vaccines and visits to pharmacies or to places, sites where they do have vaccines are supposed to be covered with no cost sharing. Medicaid and Medicare, of course, Medicare specifically for the Part B, no cost sharing for in-network sites.And then for the uninsured adults, the Health Department did launch a public-private partnership earlier this year, $1.1 billion invested in ensuring that adults do have access to these vaccines and that they will not incur any cost at the site of the vaccine. Meanwhile, kids also guaranteed.So it does-- you know, with all of this already in place, they're still running to this issue when the-- as this, you know, industry has come to the first commercial launch of these vaccines, they are running into some hiccups, there seem to be some pain points. We know that, of course, there are only two vaccines on the market right now-- that's Pfizer and Moderna that have gotten the green light for those updated boosters.And we're still waiting to hear any news from Novavax and their authorization. But even with those two, which, you know, have been on the market through the government program since the beginning of the pandemic or since those first got authorized, we're still seeing this unfortunate hiccup. So it does throw into question what that market is going to look like in total for the booster sort of season. And whether or not they can get over this hiccup and get more doses in arms.- Yeah. Booster season, but also testing season as well here, Anjalee. When we think about the availability of tests, what does that looking like and are people gravitating towards making sure that they can take advantage of the free tests where available?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. Well, you know, the government also launched that reordering of the four tests per address just today. I got mine I hope you guys got yours. Really easy to get at covidtest.gov. Definitely seeing an uptick, of course, in the cases and thus the demand for these tests. And that's sort of why the government has been ensuring that these tests get out, so that there is the access as well.This is also one of those things where, you know, those rapid at-home tests differ from the PCR tests, which do then get sequenced and sent to labs and subsequently to the CDC. The at-home tests, while they don't follow that process, do at least give some insight, you know, generally of where the increase in cases are.So it's an important way to sort of keep track as people would share, you know, photos or whatever of their COVID positive tests. So an important way to gain more insight as those free tests and as that push of tests from earlier on that we saw in the pandemic has waned certainly a different point. Though the government has ensured that test should remain covered by insurers.- All right. Yahoo Finance's own Anjalee Khemlani. Excellent coverage as always. Thanks so much, Anjalee for breaking this down.]"

(AP) — A major Pfizer pharmaceutical plant in North Carolina that makes critical supplies for U.S. hospitals has restarted production about 10 weeks after it was heavily damaged by a tornado, the company announced Monday.Getting a majority of manufacturing lines at the Rocky Mount facility back up and running is a “proud achievement,” Pfizer said in a statement. Full production across the facility's three manufacturing sites is expected by the end of the year.Parts of the massive plant's roofs were ripped open and pallets of medicine tossed around when the tornado touched down on July 19. But most of the damage was to a storage facility for raw materials, packaging supplies and finished medicines, rather than its medicine production areas, Pfizer said. No employees were hurt.The plant produces anesthesia and other drugs as well as nearly one-fourth of the sterile injectable medications Pfizer supplies to U.S. hospitals, the company said.Thirteen medicines were prioritized based on patient need and inventory levels, and are now back in production on the lines that have restarted, Pfizer said. The medicines are expected to ship to distribution centers in the fourth quarter of this year. Although manufacturing has resumed, the company said some medicines may not be back in full supply until next year.]"

The vaccine has already been recommended for use by the CDC.Last month, Abrysvo was granted marketing authorization in the European Union for prevention of RSV in both older adults and newborns.Pfizer’s shares have lost 36.2% year to date against the industry’s 5.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRSV is a contagious disease and a common cause of respiratory illness globally. Older adults, young infants and people with some chronic medical conditions are at maximum risk of getting LRTD-RSV disease. Management estimates that every year nearly 500,000-600,000 infants experience LRTD caused by RSV in the United States alone, which is a leading cause of infant hospitalization. The RSV vaccines are expected to reduce these infant hospitalizations this year.Pfizer’s Abrysvo is one of the two recently approved FDA medications available for immunizing newborns. Last month, the CDC recommended AstraZeneca AZN and Sanofi’s SNY RSV antibody nirsevimab to prevent LRTD caused by RSV in newborns and infants. Sanofi/AstraZeneca markets the vaccine under the trade name Beyfortus. Beyfortus was approved in the European Union last year in October.Story continuesThe approval for Beyfortus was based on data from the MELODY phase III and other phase IIb studies conducted jointly by AstraZeneca and Sanofi. Unlike vaccines that stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies, therapies like Beyfortus contain antibodies that are directly delivered into the bloodstream.In May, the FDA approved GSK’s GSK RSV vaccine, Arexvy, for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in older adults aged 60 and above. This was the first RSV vaccine for older adults to be approved anywhere in the world. GSK’s Arexvy was approved in Europe in June 2023.Zacks RankPfizer Inc. Price and ConsensusPfizer Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, Block Inc. SQ, Visa Inc. V and PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Crypto Stocks to Watch as Volatility LoomsOn Sep 21, the cryptocurrency market suffered a setback courtesy of the Fed. In its September FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5%, as stated on Sep 20. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dampened market participants' sentiments.Although the Fed paused its rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot-plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep interest rates higher for a longer time period. The new projection has shown two maximum rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The first cut in interest rate is not expected before September 2024.As a result, the yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note reached 5.202%, its highest level since 2006. This link is closely linked to the possibility of a near-term economic downturn. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 4.494%, its highest level since 2007.A higher market interest rate is detrimental to high-growth sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency. Notably, the crypto space suffered a huge blow last year as the Fed pursued a rigorous interest rate hike regime.Story continuesConsequently, on Sep 21, prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) slid 1.7%, 1.9%, 1.9%, 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively.Stocks in FocusRobinhood Markets Inc. operates a financial services platform in the United States.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PYPL. Click here to check it out. PYPL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PYPLAs of 2023-09-25, PayPal Holdings Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $111.56. It's currently trading at a price of $57.88. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 48.12%. The company is significantly undervalued.PayPal Holdings Inc: A Deep Dive into Its Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. PayPal Holdings Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$3.57GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.5%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 20.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=57.95Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=58.2Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=111.56Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $85.08. This valuation indicates that the PayPal Holdings Inc is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 31.97%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount.

(BRK.B) has offloaded another significant chunk of its position in HP Inc. HPQ, per filings last week, bringing down its total stake in the company to 11.2%. Last week alone, on three separate days, Berkshire Hathaway sold a total of $130 million worth of shares of HP.In April 2022, Warren Buffett’s flagship company disclosed a $4.2 billion stake in HP despite ruling out the possibility a quarter of a century ago. In a 1998 meeting between Berkshire shareholders, Buffett was asked whether he would consider investing in tech companies like IBM, Intel, HP and Microsoft. He had rued the fact that he did not understand technology like he did other sectors, and hence could not predict winners for the future. ""Well, the answer is no, and it's probably pretty unfortunate,"" he had said.However, over the past decade, the legendary nonagenarian investor has warmed up to tech. By 2011, he had managed an estimated $12 billion stake in International Business Machines Corporation IBM and then piled up about $36 billion in Apple Inc. AAPL between 2016 and 2018. Berkshire's Apple holdings have skyrocketed in value to more than $150 billion, even as the IBM bet did not pay off.So in 2022, when the news concerning Berkshire’s stake in HP came in, HP stock had gone up to a record intra-day high. However, it has tumbled more than 35% since, closing at $26.30 on Monday. In the last few weeks, Berkshire has sold more than million shares, approximately up to $300 million of its stake in the computing company.HPs expected earnings growth rate for the current year is -19.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has fallen 1.5% over the past 60 days. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). On the other hand, Berkshire’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 13.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has fallen 3% over the past 60 days. Berkshire also currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt is still not clear why Buffett’s company is reducing its stake in the tech giant. In fact, BRK.B has sold $33 billion of shares from its various positions over the last three quarters and has continued to bolster its cash reserves. Whether the prophetic investor is preparing for the rainy day, one will have to wait and watch.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 1.45% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.38% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from IBM as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, IBM is projected to report earnings of $2.13 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 17.68%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.82 billion, up 5.02% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.43 per share and revenue of $61.49 billion.

These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

171,fb982389-8b6b-3f6e-9c90-0edae4d858b1,IBM,2023-09-26,International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-ibm-130013529.html,1695646813,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 2.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.86 indicates a change of +4.5% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.82 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5%. The $61.49 billion and $64.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.6% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.42%. The EPS surprise was +9%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This may have many investors wondering if they should still buy General Motors and Ford stock for longer-term opportunities or stay clear at the moment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarket Risk &amp; UAW StrikeStarting on September 15, the UAW strike is aimed at General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler which is owned by Stellantis N.V. STLA. Targeting the big three Detroit automakers, the UAW strike is seeking to secure and increase wages and pensions. This is amid General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler expanding their electric vehicle production which will require fewer workers and varying skill sets causing concern.One metric that analyzes the risk in a stock compared to the overall market is the beta. Historically, securities with betas below 1.0 have been less volatile than the market. At the moment, General Motors stock has a beta of 1.39 with Ford at 1.61 but this is actually below Tesla’s TSLA 2.09 with Stellantis at 1.61.While this may be surprising with the ongoing UAW strike, an accurate assumption is that General Motors and Ford may continue to put pressure on Tesla in regard to the domestic EV market.Sustaining Top &amp; Bottom Lines General Motors and Ford currently hold the second and third spots in the domestic EV market respectively. Still behind the market leader in Tesla, EV expansion should certainly preserve General Motors and Ford’s top and bottom lines in the future.This year General Motors earnings are expected to be virtually flat but drop -5% in fiscal 2024 at $7.18 per share. However, FY24 EPS projections would still represent 46% growth over the last five years with 2020 earnings at $4.90 a share.Story continuesPlus, General Motors stock does make a strong case for being undervalued at just 4.2X forward earnings and sales are forecasted to rise 9% in FY23 and edge up another 2% in FY24 to $175.19 billion.(The data in the charts, except the estimates, is as of 09/25/23)Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to Ford, annual earnings are now projected to jump 12% in FY23 at $2.11 per share compared to EPS of $1.88 last year. Fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to dip -7% at $1.96 a share but would represent a very stellar 378% growth over the last five years with Ford’s earnings at $0.41 a share in 2020.Furthermore, showcasing a sharp post-pandemic recovery, Ford shares also make the case for being undervalued at 5.9X forward earnings. On the top line, sales are anticipated to rise 7% this year to $160.21 billion but dip -1% in FY24.(The data in the charts, except the estimates, is as of 09/25/23)Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineIt appears that we are not at a turning point that calls for staying clear of General Motors and Ford stock as the valuation of both auto giants is attractive. With that being said, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as the UAW strike continues.

On Sunday, the union voted in favor of a new contract with Ford that offers wage increases of up to 25% to about 5,600 workers at the automaker's Canadian facilities.""Bargaining committees will now work to negotiate the pattern-setting agreement ratified by members at Ford of Canada in addition to GM-specific issues in this second round of talks,"" Unifor said.Talks with GM are set to begin on Tuesday, the union said.Meanwhile, in the United States, negotiators for the United Auto Workers and Ford continued bargaining, with ""significant gaps to close on the key economic issues,"" the automaker said.President Joe Biden, a Democrat, plans to visit a UAW picket line in Michigan on Tuesday. Biden said on Monday that the UAW gave up an ""incredible amount"" in 2007 when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. ""They saved the automobile industry,"" Biden said, referring to the union. ""Now that the industry is roaring back, they should participate in the benefit of that.""Republican U.S. Senator Josh Hawley visited a UAW picket line outside a GM plant in Missouri on Monday. ""These workers deserve better pay, better benefits, and a GUARANTEE their jobs will stay in America,"" Hawley said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter.Republican former President Donald Trump also plans to make a speech in Michigan on auto issues on Wednesday.The UAW has historically chosen one U.S. automaker to focus on reaching a contract deal that has typically set a pattern for the other automakers but this year has been negotiating with all three simultaneously.Story continuesFord became the de facto lead company, following the union's statement on Friday that sufficient progress had been made at the No. 2 U.S. automaker to avoid the ordering of further walkouts at the company.The UAW launched strikes at 38 GM and Stellantis parts distribution operations in 20 U.S. states on Friday. Those walkouts threaten to choke off supplies of repair parts to dealers and customers.The Canadian operations of the Detroit Three are much smaller than their U.S. setups, but the three automakers each have critical factories in Canada.(Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru and David Shepardson in Washington Editing by Pooja Desai and Matthew Lewis)]"

Biden's policy to have electric vehicles account for 50% of all new auto sales by 2030 has been lauded by Trump, among other Republicans, over automation fears that could eliminate jobs and the auto parts needed for assembly.Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Rick Newman joins to discuss what is factual and what is political strategy from both sides of the aisle.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- President Biden will meet with striking UAW workers tomorrow, putting himself in the middle of the labor debate amid the transition to electric vehicles. And former president Trump not far behind. He's going to be in Michigan on Wednesday. And it comes as he launches a new campaign against EVS. Yahoo Finance senior columnist Rick Newman is here with more. So Rick, against EVs. What are the details?RICK NEWMAN: Right. So everything else is politicized in America. So why not electric vehicles? There's this Republican line that Trump has really seized on, which is that Biden caused the United Auto Workers strike because of his fervent support for electric vehicles and all the subsidies he has signed into law to try to get automakers to build more electric vehicles and people to buy more electric vehicles. Biden's policy is he wants 50% of all new car sales to be electric by 2030.So why is this a bad thing in the view of Republicans? Well, electric vehicles have fewer parts. They require fewer workers to build them. From a technological perspective, that sounds like progress to me. I mean, that's the whole history of capitalism, which is that you build a better mousetrap. You become more efficient. You improve your margins. And that's the way technology progresses. But put this in a political context, and I guess they're trying to turn that into a bad thing because it means there will be fewer automaker jobs.Story continuesNow that is not 100% true because another thing Biden has done is create these incentives for manufacturers to build all these green energy plants, electric vehicle batteries and things like that, to build these all in the United States instead of importing that, and that is actually happening. But Trump's not going to mention that. He wants the autoworkers and he wants voters, especially in swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin, to think, oh, EVs must be bad. Biden wants EVs. Therefore, I will vote for Trump. I have no idea if he's going to get any traction with that line of reasoning. It's not really right. But he's going to give it a shot.- Well, and then there's also another constituency in all of this, which is the autodealers. We were talking a little bit earlier about CarMax. For those who are selling EVs and being asked by the automakers to sell EVs, they're not necessarily very happy about it either because an EV doesn't need an oil change, right? It doesn't need as much service as a combustion engine does. So the dealers are not making the money on that aspect, right? So it's very interesting all these competing constituencies here.What I'm curious about, Rick, also is unions are traditionally very core, democratic contingent here. Is that being upended?RICK NEWMAN: Trump is definitely trying to upend it. We could talk for the next 45 minutes about all the things you raised, Julie. I mean, think, just go back to this argument. So electric vehicles require less maintenance. Don't all consumers want their products to require less maintenance? I mean, that is a non-ambiguously good thing for consumers. And dealers, by the way, they're a pretty good markups on a lot of these electric vehicles, so they're making pretty good money on a lot of them.To go back to the unions, the UAW endorsed Joe Biden in 2020, which upset Donald Trump obviously. So you know, Mr. Vengeful, he was trying to get back at the UAW for this. The UAW has not yet endorsed Biden in 2024, but they almost certainly will. But Trump at the same time has gotten a very large portion of union vote for a Republican who is not endorsed by the union itself. That happened in 2016, and it happened in 2020.So a big part of what Donald Trump is trying to do and probably the main thing he's trying to do is just get some vengeance against the leadership of the United Auto Workers. And one of his other lines is that he's been telling autoworkers, your leadership has sold you down the river, that's his phrase. And he wants to tell autoworkers that their union leaders suck and try to roil the union and see if he can just cause some mischief within the union.So you know, you can vote for whoever you want if you're in a union. You don't have to vote for the party that your union endorses. But Trump in a way is just trying to make trouble. And he's campaigning. He's trying to get the votes of blue collar workers in Michigan.- All right. We have to leave it there. But thank you, as always. Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman.]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the banking industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Bank Stocks To Buy For Long-Term.The Banking Sector In 2023The banking industry has had an eventful year so far. With the crash of the Silicon Valley Bank, multiple downgrades from the S&amp;P and Moody's, and generally negative investor sentiment surrounding this industry, it is unsurprising how many investors have been steering clear of banking companies and stocks. However, as we have headed into the second half of 2023, some are beginning to harbor renewed hopes for the sector. There are several reasons for this renewed optimism, the primary ones being a show of resilience by US banks in the face of adversity and the analysis of some experts who believe that higher interest rates may actually be beneficial for some banks.One such expert is Bob Diamond, the CEO of Atlas Merchant Capital and the former CEO of Barclays. Diamond joined CNBC's ""Closing Bell Overtime"" on September 21 to discuss how higher rates may be better for at least the regional banking sector. Here's what he first noted on the status of interest rates in the US:""The bar for reversing the position of the Fed is very, very high. We did feel it was time for a pause and they have and they have paused, but I think one of the things we are seeing in the survey, the summary of economic projections from the Fed presidents and the Fed governors is that when they project out for the funds rate at the end of 2024, it's pretty flat, the word is today. I think even that supports the view that rates are going to stay higher longer.""Can Higher Rates Be Better For Some Banks?On the subject of the banking sector, Diamond went on to discuss how these higher rates can be expected to impact regional banks:""We're very positive on regional banks. We think they're incredibly important to our economy, to the depths of the financial markets in the US. We do expect to see some consolidation there, but I think on balance, they've adjusted pretty well to the higher interest rates of 5%. As you and I both know, if they can level set that and manage to where they are today, higher rates are positive for banks. So five, five and a half percent rates, starting from scratch, are far better for the community of regional banks than zero interest rates.""Story continuesDiamond's analysis on the matter does not mention how investors can expect bigger banks like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) to react to these rates which are expected to stay higher for longer. However, the picture he paints does seem to be less bleak than the one representing the banking sector at the start of this year. In any case, the fact that large banks that have maintained a reliable presence in the US markets and abroad for so long are, at this point, trading lower than usual can actually be an incentive for investors to start pouring their money into the banking sector at this moment. This is because right now, investors have gained the opportunity to buy quality banking stocks at a relative discount to what they would have had to pay in their prime. Considering this, we have compiled a list of some of the best bank stocks to buy right now. Our list also includes some undervalued bank stocks to buy.Best Bank Stocks To Buy For Long-TermPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe selected a variety of diversified and regional banking stocks by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter.

(NASDAQ:FCNCA) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We introduced First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) in our first quarter 2023 letter. As noted, we invested in First Citizens after they acquired Silicon Valley Bank. The investment was based on our thesis that the acquisition conservatively accreted over $8 billion to First Citizens’ common equity whereas the market was pricing in substantially less.Prior to First Citizens’ earnings release, we continued to build conviction in our analysis and sized the position to the largest in the Fund. In its May 10 earnings release, in line with our analysis, First Citizens posted ~$9.1 billion of accretion from its acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank, and the market responded accordingly. We fully exited our position after the earnings release as the market incorporated the full accretion. Our investment in First Citizens generated a ~23% return over a 5-week holding period.As we discussed in our first quarter 2023 letter, we have tracked First Citizens for several years and believe the bank is led by world-class management. The bank remains on our investment watchlist, and we remain confident the company will continue to create value for shareholders, especially in light of likely future banking sector consolidation that will benefit First Citizens’ opportunistic acquisition strategy and capital strength. We exited our position in First Citizens in favor of more attractive risk-adjusted opportunities.”7. PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

(NYSE:PNC) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $630.6 million.Artisan Partners made the following comments about PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We are taking advantage of the current weakness in bank stocks. In Q1, we purchased The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) and US Bancorp. These are banks we have known for years. They are well-managed and have solid capital positions and liquidity. At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America. All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”6.

187,af976c67-4ab8-33e8-935e-ae183a99537e,ISRG,2023-09-26,Citi strategists highlight growth stocks amid rising bond yields,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citi-strategists-highlight-growth-stocks-135708360.html,1695650228.0,STORY,"['NVDA', 'MSFT', 'ISRG']","[Monday's market saw the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which includes high-growth companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), continue a recent trend of decline. The index has experienced a 6% decrease from its peak in late July. Despite this, the index has managed to maintain a year-to-date gain of 24%, driven by investor interest in artificial intelligence and increased earnings estimates.The dip in growth stocks is partly attributable to rising bond yields. The 10-year Treasury yield has been on an upward trajectory, reducing the value of future profits. This trend is particularly significant for growth companies whose valuation often hinges on profits expected to be realized in future years.However, if bond yields cease to rise, some growth stocks could appear increasingly attractive. A halt in yield increases might stabilize valuations and potentially lead to stock price increases over time.Citi's strategists have identified several such growth stocks that have become more appealing during the recent downturn. They selected stocks that have fallen more than 10% from their annual highs and whose free-cash-flow estimates have been raised by analysts since the end of March. Furthermore, these companies need to have five-year free-cash-flow estimates exceeding their current implied market capitalizations. This could suggest that these companies' cash flow potentials are being undervalued by investors.Among the identified stocks are Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) Software, MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), Bruker (NASDAQ:BRKR), DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), a provider of equipment for chip manufacturers, also emerged as a promising option. Its stock has dropped 14% from its annual high, but its free-cash-flow estimates have surged almost 24% since March. This is largely due to an anticipated increase in demand for chip manufacturing equipment as artificial intelligence needs grow within the cloud business sector.Story continuesPinterest (NYSE:PINS) also caught strategists' attention. Despite a 12% decrease from its annual peak, Pinterest's free-cash-flow estimates have risen slightly since March. While advertising spending has slowed, the social media platform expects sales growth of nearly 20% per year as it monetizes its overseas user base, which could lead to significant profit margin expansion.Other promising stocks include Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), whose share price has fallen 18% from its annual high due to concerns over new weight-loss drugs potentially reducing the need for bariatric surgeries. However, the company has stated that these surgeries only contribute a small percentage of its total revenue.Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) also made the list, with its stock down about 13% from its annual high. Despite this, free-cash-flow estimates have risen around 8% since March. The fast-food chain has consistently exceeded profit forecasts and is expected to maintain annual sales growth in the low teens, reaching over $14 billion by 2026.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The luxury lifestyle company is focused on diversifying and optimizing marketing across a variety of media and platforms in order to deliver a clear, differentiated experience to its target consumers.The company’s three strategic pillars to drive long-term growth and value creation bode well. It has been focused on elevating and energizing its lifestyle brand; driving the core and expanding products; and winning in key cities with its consumer ecosystem.The company’s focus on expanding digital experience has been well-reflected in its share price, with the stock outperforming the industry and the market. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 33.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 4.6%. The stock has also fared better than the sector’s rise of 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 18.5% in the same period.Further optimism on the stock is reflected by its forward estimates, which suggest notable growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RL’s fiscal 2024 sales and earnings suggests growth of 2.8% and 13.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Digital Business’s PerformanceIn the fiscal first quarter, the company’s digital business, including its directly-operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, remained flat year over year. Strength in its international markets more than offset weakness in North America.Starting from June 2023, RL witnessed improvement in its North America digital unit. It reached a milestone of 53.5 million social media followers globally, which reflects a year-over-year high-single-digit increase. This was mainly driven by the company’s popularity on Instagram, Line, TikTok, WeChat and other key platforms. RL continues to witness online search trends outpacing its peers globally, driven by spring icons and accessories. Region-wise, digital sales were up 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia.For fiscal 2024, management revealed plans for rich digital content and greater customer personalization. It is focused on further digital investments to continue the creation of content for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve its consumers more efficiently.Ralph Lauren continues to scale and expand its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” and endless aisle product availability. The company launched its first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app last holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform.The company is also on track to exceed its top and bottom-line targets under the “Next Great Chapter” plan announced in June 2018. This plan aims at creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities. As part of the plan, it completed the transition of Chaps to a licensed business, thus concluding its portfolio realignment announced last year. The move will likely enable it to focus on core brands as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy.Story continuesHurdles on the WayRalph Lauren has been reeling under continued product cost inflation and higher compensation. RL expects higher marketing and ecosystem investments for the fiscal second quarter. The company is also witnessing macro inflationary challenges, particularly in North America. This led to a dismal performance in its North America segment in the fiscal first quarter. Higher promotions in the North America market and an unfavorable wholesale timing shift acted as deterrents.Key PicksWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely GIII Apparel Group GIII, Guess GES and Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL.GIII Apparel currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Set to Break Two Significant Streaks With Upcoming Fiscal Third-Quarter Results,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carnival-corp-set-break-two-102426243.html,1695637466,STORY,"['CCL', 'CUK', 'NCLH', 'RCL']","[Monday, September 25, 2023 - Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp., the largest cruise line operator globally, is set to announce its fiscal third-quarter results this Friday, anticipated to mark the end of two significant trends for the company.For 14 quarters in a row, dating back to the last quarter of fiscal 2019, Carnival reported losses due to the severe impact of COVID-19 on the cruise industry and international travel restrictions that limited access to global ports. This led to a substantial revenue drop, resulting in a loss of $9.5 billion in fiscal 2021, slightly less than the $10.2 billion loss from the previous year.To stay solvent during this period, Carnival, along with smaller competitors Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), issued new stock at low prices during their operational downtime, leading to a significant increase in share count. They also heavily relied on financing, which resulted in Carnival's debt tripling and Royal Caribbean's and Norwegian Cruise Line's debt roughly doubling.However, these companies are now witnessing a return to profitability. Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line posted profits for their second quarter ending in June. Though Carnival reported a net loss for its fiscal second quarter ending in May, all 13 major analysts providing earnings estimates predict that the company will report positive net income this Friday. Predictions range from a per-share profit of $0.70 to $0.84, with a consensus average of $0.75.Another trend expected to end with this week's report is Carnival's eight-quarter streak of more than doubling its year-over-year growth. Analysts predict a sharp deceleration in growth, with a 37% increase to reach $6.7 billion for the quarter ending last month.This deceleration is not seen as a concern by industry experts. After the cruise industry was halted in spring 2020, year-over-year comparisons were favorable heading into the second half of fiscal 2021. Now, as Carnival and its peers are back in operation, Carnival is forecasted to achieve record revenue by the end of fiscal 2023.Story continuesFurthermore, Carnival's future bookings reached a record high in the previous quarter, with customer deposits for these sailings totaling $7.2 billion, $1.2 billion more than its previous record for a quarter's end. While some travel sectors experienced sluggishness this summer, cruise lines have been late entrants to the rebound travel market. The company's guidance on Friday will determine its stock direction, but the fiscal third quarter should demonstrate a solid performance, marking an end to two long streaks at Carnival.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Welltower WELL, AvalonBay Communities AVB, SBA Communications Corp. SBAC and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:4 REITs to Consider as Economic Growth Projections Move HigherAre you fretting too much about your investments in the REITs because of the Federal Reserve's recent decision to keep the benchmark interest rate steady at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.50% and indicating for keeping the rates high for a longer period? Then, it's time to think again and focus on Welltower, AvalonBay Communities, SBA Communications Corp. and Essential Properties Realty Trust.This is because although the Fed has indicated through its dot plots that there will be fewer rate cuts next year, its latest Summary of Economic Projections paints a brighter picture for economic growth and the labor market.Members have revised economic growth projections north, with the gross domestic product now expected to increase 2.1% this year, more than double June's 1% estimate, indicating that a recession is not expected in the immediate future. Further, the GDP projection for 2024 moved up to 1.5% from 1.1%.Also, the labor market is likely to exhibit resiliency than what was previously expected, with officials estimating the unemployment rate for the current year to be 3.8%, down from the prior projection of 4.1%. Further, the expected inflation rate, as measured by the core personal consumption expenditure price index, decreased to 3.7%, down by 0.2 percentage points from June.Now with economic activity ""expanding at a solid pace"", as characterized by the committee, REITs stand to gain. This is because with the REIT sector offering the real estate structure for several economic activities, be it real or virtual, there are pockets of strength, even in a high-rate environment. REITs' business usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and a resilient job market because a fatter purse gives tenants more power to demand real estate space.Story continuesWhat's more encouraging is REITs' characteristic of providing natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth. The majority of leases are tied to inflation, which leads to rent increases as inflation goes up. Therefore, even during the inflationary period, investments in the REIT industry can offer a steady stream of income.Moreover, REITs are effectively managing challenges posed by stricter credit conditions and the persistent high-interest-rate environment with typical low-leverage policies and focusing on fixed-rate and unsecured debt. Solid balance sheets remain a major reason for investors to stay invested in REITs, even amid the capital and mortgage market's turmoil in the current real estate investment environment.Per the data from Nareit's Total REIT Industry Tracker Series (T-Tracker) for the second quarter of 2023, leverage ratios remained modest with debt-to-market assets below 35%, while the percentage of total debt at a fixed rate was 91%. Moreover, the percentage of the total debt that was unsecured was 79%, offering REITs a competitive edge.Stock PicksWelltower partners with top senior housing operators, post-acute care providers and health systems and invests in the real estate infrastructure, encompassing senior housing, post-acute care communities and outpatient medical facilities in key growth markets across the United States, Canada and the UK.Welltower is well-poised to benefit from its diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets. Given the continued strength of its senior housing operating portfolio, aided by favorable demographic trends, healthy demand-supply fundamentals, and robust and accretive capital deployment activity, the company recently amped up its current-year normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share guidance to $3.51-$3.60 from $3.48-$3.59. We expect the metric to exhibit year-over-year growth of 14.9% in 2023. Furthermore, WELL's portfolio-restructuring efforts and solid balance sheet augur well.Welltower currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has been revised 1.4% north over the past two months to $3.55. It also suggests a 6% increase year over year.AvalonBay's premier portfolio of multi-family apartment communities in the high-barrier-to-entry regions of the United States is well-poised to benefit from the healthy demand for residential properties. Its portfolio diversification efforts and focus on expanding into the suburban markets are likely to aid in generating stable rental revenues over time.We estimate year-over-year growth of 5.3% in total revenues in 2023. This residential REIT is also banking on technology and scale to drive margin expansion. Further, its encouraging development pipeline and solid balance sheet augur well for long-term growth.Per its recent operating update, AvalonBay reported a 5.3% increase in same-store residential rental revenues for the two months ended Aug 31, 2023 compared with the prior-year period. This is roughly 40 basis points higher than the company's most recent expectation on Jul 31, 2023. This demonstrates its adaptability in the face of market shifts.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 stock. The estimate revision trend for 2023 FFO per share indicates a favorable outlook for the company as it has increased three cents upward over the past month to $10.57. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.SBA Communications' global footprint of extensive wireless communication assets is poised to benefit from increased capital spending by wireless carriers to expand their networks amid accelerated 4G and 5G network deployment efforts.Its long-term leases with its tenants assure stable cash flows. For 2023, we expect a 7.1% year-over-year increase in site-leasing revenues.  Also, the company's strategic buyouts and portfolio expansion efforts to capitalize on the secular trends of the industry are encouraging.SBA Communications currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has been revised four cents north over the past month to $12.90. It also suggests a 5.4% increase year over year.Essential Properties owns, acquires and manages mainly single-tenant properties, which are net leased to service-oriented and experience-based businesses on a long-term basis. The company serves casual dining, car washes, automotive services, medical services, convenience stores, equipment rental, entertainment, early childhood education and health and fitness sectors.With a portfolio comprising 1,742 freestanding net lease properties with a weighted average lease term of 14 years and a weighted average rent coverage ratio of 4.1 as of Jun 30, 2023, EPRT is well-poised to benefit from the solid fundamentals of the retail real estate market. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company's portfolio was 99.9% leased, and this reflects the solid demand for the company's properties.Essential Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has been revised 1.2% upward over the past week to $1.66. It also suggests an 8.5% increase year over year.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with RHI. Click here to check it out. SNA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SNAAs of 2023-09-25, Snap-on Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $321.43. It's currently trading at a price of $255.86. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 20.4%. The company is modestly undervalued.Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Snap-on IncThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Snap-on Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$18.05GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.5%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 11.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=185.95Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=135.48Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=321.43Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $300.70. This valuation indicates that the Snap-on Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 14.91%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

However, recent developments suggest the role of AI in guiding stock market trends might be overstated.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the renowned chip manufacturer, has exemplified this trend with its substantial sales growth due to generative AI. The company's revenue witnessed a remarkable turnaround from a decline in the first quarter to a 101% increase, exceeding Wall Street's predictions in its last two earnings reports. This development surpasses Nvidia's previous high during the crypto boom and sets the stage for an anticipated higher revenue in the third quarter of 2023.Despite these achievements, there are indications that the fervor around AI could be overstated. One such sign is the fluctuating user traffic on ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that has sparked interest in generative AI. Following a dip in utilization over the summer, there has been a recent recovery in usage coinciding with schools reopening. This pattern suggests that ChatGPT's popularity is primarily driven by students using it for homework assistance.Adding to these concerns are unconfirmed rumors that Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:MSFT) may be reducing orders for Nvidia H100 AI chips. This speculation arises from slowing traffic on ChatGPT and lower-than-expected interest in Microsoft 365 Copilot.Microsoft's hefty $13 billion investment in OpenAI—the organization behind ChatGPT—could now be facing hurdles. CEO Satya Nadella had previously fueled enthusiasm around generative AI by claiming it would revolutionize search engines. However, since launching its ChatGPT-powered version of Bing, the search engine landscape remains largely unchanged with Google (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:GOOGL) continuing to dominate the market and generate significant profits.Investors are being cautioned to temper their expectations regarding AI. While the potential of AI is undeniable, the widespread adoption of these new technologies will require time, similar to the years it took for the internet and smartphones to become mainstream. Investors are advised to avoid excessive hype in the AI sector and instead focus on diversification, assessing value, and patience.

202,56e2a795-138c-31e7-9cb2-d06076cbaeb7,NVDA,2023-09-26,Getty Images partnering with Nvidia over AI image generator,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/getty-images-partnering-nvidia-over-210617702.html,1695675977,VIDEO,"['NVDA', 'GETY']","[Getty Images (GETY) will be partnering with chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) to build out its own AI-powered image generator. Yahoo Finance's Diane King Hall, Josh Schafer, and Pras Subramanian take a look back on Getty's lawsuit against AI art generator Stability AI and what the stock image supplier's pivot in the artificial intelligence space could mean.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: And whenever we're talking trending and we're talking something buzzy, it feels like we're talking AI, Diane.DIANE KING HALL: Of course! Of course!JOSH SCHAFER: I know you have your eyes on an AI story today.DIANE KING HALL: I have-- I mean, there have been several that have crossed our radar today, right? One that stood out to me today is this Getty Images story. You know, you want to call this kind of artistic license meets AI. So Getty partnering with the king of AI, Nvidia, to launch something that's being called Generative AI by Getty Images, right?So what's interesting about this, to me, is, we think about earlier this year, Getty had pursued some legal action against Stability AI about what they were doing, saying they were stealing some of their images, right? But now they're turning this kind of-- or embracing AI. They said they had already been partnering with Nvidia. And then in terms of using the images that-- using its platform to elevate its images using AI. And so it just shows the expanding use case for AI, right?JOSH SCHAFER: Two big things that stood out to me is, one, just seeing Nvidia called out again for being the company that's helping here. I feel like we keep seeing that, and it came up a lot over earnings season, people just openly saying, Nvidia is the driver, right? Nvidia is the company we want to work with, and they're going to help us build out that AI strategy.And then the other thing, Pras, that I thought about when I think of Getty Images-- it's something we use here at Yahoo and plenty of newsrooms use to put images on the internet, right? A lot of newsrooms subscribe to Getty Images and then put them at the top of articles.Story continuesAnd one thing that Getty said, according to a Bloomberg article, that they're not going to be doing with this is licensing news photos, because that's the first thing I thought of is, oh, boy. Now we can get, you know, the deepfake kind of stuff we've talked about with AI and getting images that probably shouldn't be on the internet that aren't necessarily real with real powerful people. So it's good to see, for me, at least, I think, to keep that part safe and not really work with that side of it yet.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of questions there, right? So Diane, you mentioned the fact that they sued Stability AI, which makes the Stable Diffusion, the product that people have been using a lot of to make those AI images that you're talking about, that we don't want them to show Biden, like, riding a tractor in the middle of nowhere, right?But you know, I think the issue there is now, so we're talking about maybe stock photos, right? Like, we're talking about people who make stock photos, are they going to be upset about this? I don't know. We'll see. Are we going to have the ability to see, is there to be marking on these images, so this is a AI-generated image? And lastly, why not use it for news stuff, right? If I want a picture of a car dealership and I can't find one, just make one for me. Make one for me with Toyota Camrys--DIANE KING HALL: That's fair.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --on the lot.JOSH SCHAFER: To me, it gets dangerous with people, though.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You could do that.DIANE KING HALL: Yes, it does.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You could do that. It's dangerous, but the Toyota Camry, like who cares?DIANE KING HALL: Yeah, that's a fair point.

SPRX invests in companies benefiting from AI, Enterprise Digitalization, Automation, and Robotics.There was a lot of hype surrounding Arm's ARM IPO, primarily due to its positioning as an AI play and its partnership with NVIDIA. The shares of the British chip designer surged on debut but have since fallen and are now trading close to the IPO price.NVIDIA remains a top holding in SPRX because Ivana believes that the initial surge was driven by oversold conditions and hype. As we progress further into the cycle, the world's most valuable chipmaker has the earnings power to sustain the hype.Zscaler ZS should be able to maintain a 30%+ topline growth rate for the next decade, as its products are in the early stages of adoption, according to Spear.

The Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA, the first rapid antigen test that detects COVID-19 to be awarded FDA market clearance through the FDA’s De Novo process, is now the first rapid antigen test also to receive CLIA waiver.The test, intended for prescription use only, can be used in CLIA-waived point-of-care settings.The latest waiver is likely to significantly boost QuidelOrtho’s Point of Care business unit.A Few Words About the TestThe enhanced Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA Test kit includes other upgraded features, such as pre-filled reagent vials, improved ergonomic sample extraction and a dropper design for easy dispensing of patient samples into the test cassette sample well. The Sofia 2 instrument also offers two distinct workflows — WALK AWAY Mode and READ NOW Mode.The results obtained via the test kit are for the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein antigen, which is generally detectable in upper respiratory specimens during the acute phase of infection.The Sofia 2 system connects to Virena, QuidelOrtho’s data management system, which provides aggregated, de-identified testing and surveillance data in near real time.Significance of the WaiverFollowing the CLIA waiver, the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA is deemed to be simple and has a low risk of error. Hence, it no longer requires administration by trained clinical laboratory personnel, thereby opening broader use in any point-of-care setting equipped with Sofia 2 instruments.The Sofia 2 analyzer utilizes QuidelOrtho’s proprietary fluorescent chemistry design, intuitive graphical user interface and optics system to provide an accurate, objective and automated result in 10 minutes. This is a 33% reduction from the breakthrough 15-minute processing time achieved in the first iterations of the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA assay.Story continuesPer management, the receipt of the FDA’s CLIA waiver qualifies as a trifecta/milestone of innovation, advancement and accessibility in the in vitro diagnostics space. This is reflective of QuidelOrtho’s efforts to aid customers in reducing costs and speeding workflows, thus delivering improved patient care.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Precedence Research, the global diagnostic testing market was valued at $165.58 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to exceed $348.75 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 8.6%. Factors like the increasing use of point-of-care diagnostic products and the rising elderly population leading to an increase in the chance of developing a wide range of illnesses (including diabetes) are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory achievement will likely provide a significant impetus to QuidelOrtho’s business.Notable DevelopmentLast month, QuidelOrtho reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an uptick in the company’s overall top line. The company recorded a continued uptick in Sofia’s non-COVID pull-through and growth in QuidelOrtho’s integrated installed base and automation. During the quarter, QuidelOrtho completed the Savanna Emergency Use Authorization and 510(k) FDA submissions, including 510(k) for the instrument in both RVP4 and HSV VZV lesion panels.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 1.7% in the past year against the industry’s 0.4% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 18.5% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, QuidelOrtho carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

HQY is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its unique investment platform. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and strength in Health Savings Accounts (HSA) are expected to contribute further. However, data security issues and the complexity of regulations are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 2.8% against the 5.1% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 18.5% growth in the said time frame.The renowned provider of technology-enabled services platforms for healthcare savings and spending decisions has a market capitalization of $6.22 billion. The company projects 23.5% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. HealthEquity’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 13%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Unique Investment Platform: We are optimistic about HealthEquity’s multiple cloud-based platforms, accessed by its members online via a desktop or mobile device. Individuals can make health-saving and spending decisions and pay healthcare bills, among other activities, via these platforms. These platforms provide users access to services HealthEquity provides as well as services provided by third parties selected by HealthEquity or its Network Partners. Among other features, HealthEquity’s HSA platform has the capability to provide users with medical bills upon adjudication by a health plan, including details such as the amount paid by insurance.Strength in HSA: HealthEquity’s total number of HSAs, as of Jul 31, 2023, rose 8.5% year over year. HealthEquity reported 574,000 HSAs with investments as of Jul 31, 2023, up 11.2% year over year. Total Accounts, as of Jul 31, 2023, were up 3.1% year over year. This uptick included total HSAs and 6.8 million other CDBs. Total HSA assets at the end of Jul 31, 2023, were up 12.9% year over year. This included HSA cash and HSA investments.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: HealthEquity saw solid top-line and bottom-line performances in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The top line benefited from robust contributions from all its revenue sources. The expansion of both margins was also seen.DownsidesComplexity of Regulations: HealthEquity’s business, including HSAs and many of the CDBs it administers and investment advisers and trust company subsidiaries, is subject to extensive, complex and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations. Its subsidiary, HealthEquity Advisors, LLC, is a SEC-registered investment adviser that provides automated web-only investment advisory services. As such, it must comply with the requirements of the Advisers Act and related SEC regulations and is subject to periodic inspections by the SEC staff.Data Security Issues: HealthEquity deals with a high level of sensitive personal data and information. Any security breaches might result in the loss of sensitive information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation or indemnity obligations to the customers. The company’s ability to ensure the security of its technology platforms and, thus, sensitive customer and partner information is critical to its operations.Estimate TrendHealthEquity has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 4.7% north to $2.01.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $242.4 million, suggesting a 12.2% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company to watch right now is McKesson (MCK). MCK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 15.19, while its industry has an average P/E of 18.73. MCK's Forward P/E has been as high as 15.66 and as low as 12.75, with a median of 14.47, all within the past year.Finally, our model also underscores that MCK has a P/CF ratio of 13.48. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. MCK's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 24.01. Over the past 52 weeks, MCK's P/CF has been as high as 22.25 and as low as 11.52, with a median of 13.25.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that McKesson is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, MCK sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

208,e63a78ee-fb3c-39e0-9971-9df5d5fe736f,MCK,2023-09-26,5 Low-Beta Stocks to Sail Through a Choppy Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-beta-stocks-sail-115800433.html,1695643080,STORY,"['MCK', 'PEP', 'VST', 'JJSF', 'AWK']","[The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged in its September FOMC meeting, as widely expected, but that has failed to cheer investors. The decision came with a strong warning that inflation is still high and another rate hike would be required.This saw a huge selloff last week, leading to all three major indexes ending in the red. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the week 1.9%, 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively, lower. Meanwhile, the  2-year and 10-year Treasury yields jumped to their highest levels since 2006 and 2007, respectively.Understandably, fears of a recession have once again escalated. It would thus be wise to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank that are likely to strengthen one’s portfolio.Markets Turn Volatile AgainThe Fed left interest rates intact in September, which now keeps its benchmark rate in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The central bank has so far increased interest rates by 525 basis points on 11 occasions since March 2022. September was only the second instance during this period that the Fed kept it unaltered.However, despite the sharp increase in interest rates, which saw inflation steeply declining over the past year, it remains more than double the Fed’s 2% target rate.The Fed has thus said that another interest rate of a quarter percentage point would be required, which is likely to come in its November meeting before they start cutting interest rates from 2024.However, the Federal Reserve also cut its forecast for interest rate cuts in 2024 from four to two. The hawkish stance has raised concerns of a slowdown, which has been taking a toll on stocks.Also, inflation rose again in August. The consumer price index (CPI) reading for August rose 0.6% month over month, higher than July’s rise of 0.2%.Year over year, CPI jumped 3.7% in August, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.6%. This is also the first time since February 2022 that CPI has increased more than 0.6% month over month.Story continuesCore CPI, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose 0.3%, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI jumped 4.3%.The sudden rise in inflation in August was largely driven by the jump in oil prices, which has left investors worried. Understandably, market volatility is going to stay for a longer time or at least till the time the Fed gives a clearer picture of the economic health of the nation in the near term.Our ChoicesInvestors should thus consider stocks that offer risk-adjusted returns like American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Vistra Corp. VST, McKesson Corporation MCK and J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp. JJSF.These stocks belong to the utilities consumer staples sector, which is non-cyclical in nature and are not largely influenced by market fluctuations. Also, these stocks belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1). Hence, the recommended approach is to invest in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.American Water Works Company, Inc. provides essential water services to over 14 million customers in 24 states and has an employee strength of 6,500.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for F5 basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For F5, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for F5For the fiscal year ending September 2023, this computer networking company is expected to earn $11.42 per share, which is a change of 12.1% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for F5. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of F5 to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now. Dividend Kings are companies that have a remarkable track record of consistently increasing their dividends to shareholders for close to 50 years or more. Achieving the status of a Dividend King is a significant accomplishment and demonstrates the company's financial stability and ability to generate consistent cash flow. While investors typically like it when a company increases its dividend payments, this is not the only reason they invest in that company. Historically, stocks of companies that consistently raise their dividends have also performed exceptionally well, bringing investors’ attention toward such equities.According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1973, companies that have either increased or started paying dividends have seen the highest returns compared to other stocks. These returns have been achieved with considerably less price fluctuation or volatility. The report mentioned that during this period, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return while dividend cutters returned 3.95% to shareholders.  The market is also favorable for dividends because a robust U.S. economy has allowed companies to increase their profits and cash reserves, leading to record-high levels of cash in their accounts.Also read: Dividend Stock Portfolio: 15 Stocks To Buy According to RedditIn the first half of the year, dividend stocks faced a setback as investors flocked toward fast-growing tech stocks. However, as investment trends shifted and market sentiment became more uncertain, dividend stocks became attractive again. The data from the second quarter of 2023 supports this idea, as global dividends have increased. According to Janus Henderson, 88% of companies worldwide either raised or maintained their dividends in the second quarter.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”12. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49An American multinational diversified conglomerate, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is next on our list of the best dividend kings to buy now.

Senior Analyst Laura Martin explains how strikes could impact the volume of content that streaming services produce. “Wall Street is demanding they.. move to profitability faster,” Martin says. For streamers, this could mean cutting down seasons by filming fewer episodes—“less content spending”, as Martin notes. Martin expects consolidation in the industry, which will help “get rid of duplicative costs.”In regards to smaller streamers, Martin states that due to large competitors such as Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) “there’s no advantage to being small.”For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Laura, how well are we able to measure the correlation between new programming and subscriber growth? And have we already started to see-- it's probably a little early. Have we started to see any kind of uptick or indication that there are some cancelations coming because, oh, people are saying my new show is not going to come for a while?LAURA MARTIN: So, I think, what we heard from Disney last week, because we were in Orlando with Bob Iger, the CEO, and what he said was, look, we're going to make lower cost, fewer episodes, for our streaming platform, and actually, also films. He's like, we're going to do more sequels, and we're going to have fewer numbers of Marvel and ""Star Wars"" and princesses. So I do think all of these companies that have been losing money in streaming, I think Wall Street is demanding they start-- they move to profitability faster, which means we're going to have less content spending.To their credit, writers got minimum numbers of credit per series, but the number of series is about to go down because all these streamers need to make money. Because now they're raising capital at a 7% cost, and it used to be, two years ago, 0% cost. So Wall Street's screaming, they have to have a return on capital higher than 7% now. So they're going to make fewer shows.Story continues- I go back five years in time, I remember when Disney, for instance-- I don't know if it was five years ago, but we had all these new players in the market. And people started talking about peak content. It seems that moment has passed. And then we're in this new phase where there's a lot more competition for those production dollars. Who do you see as the winners emerging here? And do you see any kind of-- any more kind of a consolidation?LAURA MARTIN: Yes, I do see I think we have to consolidate because, basically, growth is zero. And the only way to grow earnings per share is you have to buy something and then you have to sort of get rid of duplicative costs, and that grows your earnings per share for 2 or 3 years while you get rid of positions that are duplicated in a consolidation. So I do see more consolidation.And I also see the big get bigger, and the small are disadvantaged. If you look at the like the public companies in streaming, like Curiosity Stream, Chicken Soup for the Soul, Fubo, there's no competitive advantage to being smaller when you're going up to-- when you're competing against Netflix, and Disney, and Comcast, and Amazon, and Apple. Like there's just no advantage to being small anymore. This has become a land of giants. And so you sort of need to merge or get the heck out of the way because you're going to get stomped on.]"

Alex Weprin, Media and Business Writer for the Hollywood Reporter, tells Yahoo Finance Live that late-night shows are expected to resume production within the next few weeks. However, the resumption of scripted movies and TV shows is going to depend more on a resolution in the ongoing strike by the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). The primary issues revolve around AI and streaming, as SAG-AFTRA asserts that compensation should be on par with what they receive for traditional linear television programs.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, Hollywood writers have reached a tentative deal with studios after 146 days on the picket line. They may be able to finally hang up their signs. Now, the deal is expected to be ratified within the next week or two. Then the studios will have to work to do with the Actors Guild.Now, SAG-AFTRA tweeted following the WGA news saying, quote, ""We look forward to reviewing the terms of the WGA and AMPTP's tentative agreement. And we remain ready to resume our own negotiations with the AMPTP as soon as they're prepared to engage on our proposals in a meaningful way.""Well, joining me now for the latest on this is Alex Weprin, media and business writer for ""The Hollywood Reporter."" Good to have you on the show, Alex. So at least some welcome relief here at this point. What do we know about what this means in terms of the shows that we can expect to come back online and start production?ALEX WEPRIN: Well, Rachelle, the first shows that are going to come back are the late night shows. They've been dark since the Writers went on strike back in May. Those should come back online in the next couple of weeks or so. It depends on when they can get staffs to the office. The thing with a lot of the other scripted movies and TV shows, though, is that those really can't resume production until SAG-AFTRA has a new Deal, as well.Story continuesAnd so that's why I think there's going to be a big push to try and resolve the strike with SAG-AFTRA because the clock is ticking right now for the holidays. So I think that there's going to be a big push to resolve that strike. And until they do, most scripted film and television is still going to be shut down.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then in terms of some of the-- obviously, there's overlapping issues with the WGA that SAG-AFTRA has. But what are some of the more complex ones which are going to hold up production getting back on track?ALEX WEPRIN: There are a couple of issues this time around that just didn't exist before. There were some like pay raises and increase residuals. Those are obvious. Those are things, I think, everyone is expecting to deal with. But the role of artificial intelligence in film and television creation, that's a whole new problem for them to solve.And so the specific language around how they can use AI, that's been a sticking point for the writers. They did come to a solution. We don't know what the specific details are. But they seem to come to an agreement. That's going to be a sticking point with the actors as well who are really worried about virtual actors or AI-generated actors being used in film and television production. So that's a sticking point.And then the other big sticking point is streaming. When this deal was ratified, SAG-AFTRA, the last deal, streaming was a thing. But it's now become the dominant place for scripted film and TV. And they believe that they should be paid commensurate with what they were getting paid for their linear television programs. That wasn't the case. And so these two new technologies, streaming and AI, . Those are kind of the big sticking pointsRACHELLE AKUFFO: Because it really does come to really future-proofing the industry. As you mentioned, a lot of things just weren't on the radar when a lot of these original deals were negotiated. And I do want to bring up something that you mentioned, which is about the timing, because you were saying in your notes that the importance of reaching a deal before Thanksgiving, otherwise, we could see these strikes go into 2024. What sort of domino effect then does that mean for production and even being able to get some of these shows out?ALEX WEPRIN: Yeah. I mean, look, you know, let's say that SAG the studios resume talks at some point this week. Maybe later this week. Then you're talking about a couple of weeks to negotiate a deal at best, and then it'll take a couple of weeks for it to get ratified. SAG is a very big union. There's over 100,000 members.And at that point, you're just about at Thanksgiving. And between Thanksgiving and Christmas, that's when Hollywood usually shuts down. So at that point, most productions probably won't be able to get up and running until 2024. Maybe there will be a push to get some up and running in between Thanksgiving and Christmas.But at that point, you know, it's going to have a major impact on the bottom line, especially for the linear television channels, which won't really have new shows until later in the spring. So there really is a sprint here to get a deal done, I think. And the sooner they can get one going, the sooner they can get these shows back on the air, and the sooner that the companies that own these channels and streaming services can reverse their financial fortunes.]"

Both companies hold significant influence in their respective sectors, and positive news could potentially trigger a market turnaround.Nike, the athletic footwear giant, has had a tough year in 2023, with its shares dropping about 25% since the beginning of the year. The company's struggle to maintain previous growth rates due to multiple obstacles has heightened investor concerns about its recovery pace.In June, Nike reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results for the period ending May 31. Despite a 5% increase in overall sales compared to the same quarter last year, the strong U.S. dollar and increased costs for materials and shipping, along with extensive markdowns to clear inventory, negatively impacted profits. This resulted in a drop in earnings and raised investor concerns about slow guidance for the new fiscal year.Nike's fiscal first-quarter results are expected to be released on Thursday afternoon. The company itself predicted that revenue would likely remain flat or increase by low-single-digit percentages for the quarter. Consensus forecasts suggest that earnings will suffer a 25% blow and settle at $0.70 per share. Despite these projections, many investors continue to have faith in Nike's long-term prospects due to its history of enduring difficult times and consistently generating modest yet significant sales and profit gains.On the other hand, Micron Technology, a leading semiconductor chipmaker, has seen nearly 40% gains in 2023. As a memory chip manufacturer, Micron has benefitted from the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. However, its financial report due on Wednesday afternoon will prove critical in determining whether Micron truly deserves its place in the bull market among chipmakers.Story continuesMicron's fiscal third-quarter report for the period ending June 1 was less than stellar, with revenue dropping by more than half compared to the same period last year, resulting in an adjusted net loss of $1.57 billion. Despite this, some investors found solace in the fact that sales seemed to have reached their lowest point during this period, with Micron predicting gradual recoveries in the following quarters.For its fiscal fourth quarter, Micron anticipates revenue to be between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion, which could signify some progress towards regaining its previous peak performance. However, it is unlikely to offset its losses completely, with predictions of per-share losses ranging from $1.12 to $1.26.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The average pension ""funded ratio"" for public companies in the S&amp;P 500 stock index was 102% as of last Thursday, marking the highest level since at least the end of 2011 when the ratio stood at around 78%.The funded ratio is a measure of a pension's financial health, comparing a company's pension assets against its liabilities. Essentially, it assesses the money a pension currently has on hand versus the funds a company needs to pay future pension income to workers.""This is a really good thing,"" Byron Beebe, global chief commercial officer for Aon, said on Monday. ""It's at the highest it's been in a really long time."" However, as the American Academy of Actuaries points out, pension funding is merely a ""financial snapshot ... at a single moment,"" and can change based on factors like the health of the U.S. economy.This improvement in pension funding is significant for workers. A better funded status makes it more likely companies will keep their pensions active and reduces the risk of benefit cuts for some workers. In extreme cases, underfunding can lead to benefit cuts. Companies with failed pensions may transfer their obligations to the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which guarantees pension benefits up to a limit, based on age.Pensions in the private sector have become rarer over the decades as companies have replaced them with 401(k)-type plans. Defined-benefit plans peaked in 1983 with 175,000 plans in the private sector, but by 2020 that number had declined to about 46,000, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. Many of these plans are now ""frozen"" and no longer allow workers to accrue benefits.The recent improvement in pension funding is largely attributable to three factors: a rise in interest rates, strong stock performance, and policy changes to how some companies fund their plans, according to John Lowell, partner at October Three, a pension consulting firm. Higher interest rates on bonds generally mean companies don't have to contribute as much money to their pensions today to satisfy future benefits. Furthermore, companies have become more proactive about making contributions to their plans to ensure they're fully funded due to rising insurance premiums paid to the PBGC.Story continuesCompanies have also adopted investment strategies that fluctuate less with the whims of the investment markets, said Beebe at Aon. For a portion of the portfolio, they buy bonds whose income matches that of future pension promises, offering more predictability.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent sale by Christopher Kempczinski was the biggest sale of McDonald's shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$270. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Over the last year we saw more insider selling of McDonald's shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At McDonald's Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at McDonald's. In total, insiders sold US$2.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes McDonald's Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. McDonald's insiders own about US$240m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At McDonald's Tell Us?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that McDonald's is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for McDonald's that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The S&amp;P's 500 gains are being led by energy stocks. That group is up to date even as oil prices are falling, and energy stocks have underperformed the underlying commodity this year. In other words, it hasn't been sort of neck and neck between the two. Let's talk to an investor who likes one oil stock in particular.Ken Mahoney, Mahoney Asset Management Chief Executive Officer is back with some picks here. And let's start with that oil stock, Ken. It is ExxonMobil. And it has been an interesting ride for these oil stocks. They've been performing very well this quarter, but they haven't necessarily kept pace with the gains that we've seen in the underlying commodities. So why are you looking at Exxon?KEN MAHONEY: Yeah, your math is correct. Actually, we went sub $70 a barrel a couple of times now. So from 70 to 90 something, yeah, it's like 27%, 28% increase in the underlying oil. And of course, Exxon didn't go up that much altogether. But you know, look, we are mostly growth managers. We like technology, but we're trying to find some positions outside of technology should they falter, should evaluations come in a little bit.Story continuesYou know, it seems like there's a $70 put somewhere there. Every time we go down there, Saudis come up and say, hey, we're going to cut a million barrels a day. And they've done that twice. So I think investors can feel comfortable there's some type of downside. When you invest, it's always risk and reward.And I think for investors, they kind of know the downside is something low $70 a barrel. Exxon pays a 3.5% dividend. You can see the kind of chart there, again, made a nice move after being choppy most of this year. But I think it's a good way to invest outside of tech as a way to get a decent dividend, more of a value play. And hopefully, there is that put, which I believe there is, in the low 70s.JARED BLIKRE: It seems like it's been energy or tech. But I want to talk about another field, consumer discretionary. You're also talking about McDonald's, which you like. And I want to go to the YFi Interactive here. Just looking at the year-to-date chart, it is off of its highs here, record highs. But on a 10-year basis, you can see maybe it's just come down to the lower end of its channel here. I'm talking technicals. What do you like about the fundamentals here?KEN MAHONEY: So the fundamentals are interesting. It's always one thing to say, oh, technology is going to help a company. With McDonald's, it's really amazing what they've done here. They have kiosks now if you've gone into McDonald's. And you can order kiosks. And it's a nice environment. It's a screen and so forth. And they found that people that actually go on there onto the kiosk spend maybe 20% or 30% more than if they wait in line.You go up on line and you kind of look up. And you're kind of [INAUDIBLE] and then you move over because people are waiting and so forth. But the kiosk is very interesting. Not everybody's going to order in kiosk. It's not going to be everything there. But the look of those numbers. And again, we can't extract 20% growth because of the kiosk.But that's, again, when you try to find a catalyst, what's going to bring the stock back near your highs, I think technology. They've really taken a big bite into technology. And I think it's really-- again, it could be one of the discretionary consumers, as you said. That's kind of a sleeper. Everybody knows the name, it's McDonald's. But again, that kiosk could be a game changer.JULIE HYMAN: And let's talk about stuff that you don't, Ken. And we start here with Macy's. Now, I think you're not alone on this one. This has not exactly been a loved name. But it has come back to some extent. And we were just talking in a segment a few minutes ago about going into the holiday season here. Why should investors steer clear of Macy's?KEN MAHONEY: Well, the management guidance even told us. We like companies that beat estimates and raised guidance. And they actually lowered their guidance. And you think about, if you're going to be in retail, if you had to pick one out, it wouldn't be Macy's. And think about Prime Day for Amazon. They did $12.7 billion of revenues in one day, July 12, and July 14.And then you look at Macy's, the entire year, they do about $25 billion in revenues. So basically, one day in Amazon is about six months of selling there in Macy's. So I think it's a pretty big difference. Again, I think stocks that make new lows continue to make more lows. So I think technically, it's kind of trapped, lower guidance. And if you're going to a retailer, why even be around Macy's when you have companies like Amazon that in one day do half to revenue they do in the entire year.JARED BLIKRE: All right. I also want to talk more broadly about US small caps. And for that, we're looking at the Russell 2000 or the IWM ETF. And I want to pull up the YFI Interactive one more time just to show the choppiness that we have seen this year. We've seen a couple of highs here. And we are marching back down to the lows. And in fact, if we look over the last three years, maybe we're just going sideways over the last two. What are you seeing in the small cap space?KEN MAHONEY: I'm seeing that the lot of nervous investors. We are in a narrow market, whether we like it or not. We always tend to underweighted, so S&amp;P 500, and then put in Apple, Microsoft, and all them, and kind look at the difference. Look, investors are still very nervous. They want big, liquid stocks. And small caps don't fit that definition. So for us to get a rally, I think first is to be led by those tech names, Microsoft after having a really difficult August, September.The leadership, I believe, is going to come back to Apple, Microsoft, all those leaders that happened before this mess. And before we get to small caps, it's going to take some time. So I think most money is going to go into liquid names, big names. Hopefully, they carry the day with good earnings coming up in the third, fourth week in October. And really I think small caps right here is really an afterthought.JULIE HYMAN: All right. We'll see what happens. Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, thanks. Good to have you here.KEN MAHONEY: Great. Thanks.]"

During the second quarter of 2023, the company introduced Spicy McNuggets, a popular line extension, in various markets, including Australia and Germany. This exemplifies the company's approach to modernizing the core menu, catering to evolving customer taste preferences and successfully scaling new ideas globally. Notably, both markets experienced significant boosts in McNuggets line sales, with Spicy McNuggets sales achieving an all-time high in Australia. Also, the company reported solid contributions from the McCrispy portfolio, reflecting a catalyst for chicken growth for many of its markets.

Achieving the status of a Dividend King is a significant accomplishment and demonstrates the company's financial stability and ability to generate consistent cash flow. While investors typically like it when a company increases its dividend payments, this is not the only reason they invest in that company. Historically, stocks of companies that consistently raise their dividends have also performed exceptionally well, bringing investors’ attention toward such equities.According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1973, companies that have either increased or started paying dividends have seen the highest returns compared to other stocks. These returns have been achieved with considerably less price fluctuation or volatility. The report mentioned that during this period, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return while dividend cutters returned 3.95% to shareholders.  The market is also favorable for dividends because a robust U.S. economy has allowed companies to increase their profits and cash reserves, leading to record-high levels of cash in their accounts.Also read: Dividend Stock Portfolio: 15 Stocks To Buy According to RedditIn the first half of the year, dividend stocks faced a setback as investors flocked toward fast-growing tech stocks. However, as investment trends shifted and market sentiment became more uncertain, dividend stocks became attractive again. The data from the second quarter of 2023 supports this idea, as global dividends have increased. According to Janus Henderson, 88% of companies worldwide either raised or maintained their dividends in the second quarter. This added up to a total of $568.1 billion in dividend payments globally since the beginning of the year. The report also mentioned that 98% of the US companies either raised or held their dividends steady during the quarter.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are some of the companies that have raised their payouts for years, becoming top choices for investors.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”12. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49An American multinational diversified conglomerate, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is next on our list of the best dividend kings to buy now.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with RHI. Click here to check it out. RHI 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of RHIAs of 2023-09-25, Robert Half Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $94.66. It's currently trading at a price of $72.92. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 22.97%. The company is modestly undervalued.Invest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Robert Half IncThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Robert Half Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$5.04GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.5%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 12.40% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=54.03Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=40.63Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=94.66Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $127.78. This valuation indicates that the Robert Half Inc is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 42.93%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

However, macroeconomic headwinds continue to affect the stock. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).ResMed continues to see robust demand for its market-leading mask portfolio despite facing challenges related to lower new patient setups from a competitor recall. Continued product development is driving growth within this business globally. The company has successfully introduced a full suite of masks in its AirFit and AirTouch and other ranges. Further, to promote greater patient adherence, ResMed offers advanced and expanded integrations of its therapy-based software solutions, including AirView.In the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, across the markets in the United States, Canada and the Latin America region, masks and other sales increased 19%, which reflected solid resupply and growth in new patients’ setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, sales improved 14% at constant currency.Meanwhile, ResMed’s respiratory care business continues to drive growth, courtesy of the adoption of bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions worldwide. The company is investing in newer-to-market technologies for patients, including home-based high-flow therapy for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD at home.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough still early for market development, ResMed continues to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support the broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease at home. Investing in these opportunities enables the company to address COPD as one of the top global diseases for hospitalization and the principal cause of re-hospitalization in the United States.Given the high incidence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD and neuromuscular disease, ResMed aims to develop low-cost, high-quality solutions to address this health epidemic.Story continuesOn the flip side, the company’s high debt level remains a concern. As of Jun 30, 2023, long-term debt was $1.43 billion, while cash and cash equivalents were only $228 million. A higher debt level induces higher interest payments, which comes along with the risk of failure to pay the same. At the end of fiscal 2023, the company had a times interest earned ratio of 24.3%, sequentially lower than the fiscal third quarter’s ratio of 29%.Global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and volatility in capital markets, could continue to affect ResMed’s results of operations. A decline in the global economic environment may reduce demand for the company’s products, resulting in lower sales, lower product prices and reduced reimbursement rates by third-party payers, while increasing the cost of operating the business.These factors have affected ResMed’s supply chain operations globally, primarily through constraints on raw materials and electronic components. Furthermore, with sustained inflationary pressures in the future, the company may struggle to keep its operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in check. We are worried that this might adversely impact ResMed’s profitability.Over the past year, shares of ResMed plunged 36.5% against the industry’s 0.4% rise.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Quanterix QTRX and Intuitive Surgical ISRG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Haemonetics stock has risen 22.8% in the past year. Earnings estimates for Haemonetics have increased from $3.74 to $3.82 for 2023 and remained constant at $4.07 for 2024 in the past 30 days.HAE’s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 19.39%.

The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company's cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives.Amazon.com's strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Sares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the year-to-date period (+5.0% vs. -15.6%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the second quarter, this jet giant booked 460 net commercial airplane orders and recorded a 10% hike in service revenues.A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing's growth. The company holds a strong solvency position in the near term. However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term.Further, the company has been incurring notable abnormal production cost in relation to production quality issues for 787 jets that may hurt its future results. Its dispute with Embraer over termination of the earlier made joint venture might cause Boeing to incur some loss in the future.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Regeneron shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+14.1% vs. -14.8%).  The company maintains momentum on asthma drug Dupixent's stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications. Growth in Dupixent through additional label expansions and a promising late-stage pipeline set the momentum for further development.The approval of Libtayo for additional indications is likely to drive the drug's sales and diversify the company's portfolio. Additionally, the company received a significant boost with the FDA approval of a higher dose of aflibercept at 8mg.Regeneron has a deep pipeline and the development of additional drugs will be an incremental boost to the company. However, lead drug Eylea sales are under pressure due to increasing competition. A decline in Eylea sales will hurt Regeneron's performance.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Boston Scientific Corp. and Waste Management, Inc.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

244,25deae9d-62be-3ee5-beb3-840f05e46793,NSC,2023-09-26,Cincinnati voters to decide on sale of Cincinnati Southern Railway to NS,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cincinnati-voters-decide-sale-cincinnati-232553504.html,1695684353,STORY,['NSC'],"[A Norfolk Southern train. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Those for and against the sale of the Cincinnati Southern Railway to Norfolk Southern are gearing up for a Nov. 7 vote in which Cincinnati residents get to decide whether the city will sell the rail line to NS for $1.62 billion.The Cincinnati Southern Railway Board of Trustees owns the 382-mile railroad in a trust and leases it to NS for Cincinnati’s benefit. The city currently receives about $25 million annually from NS, according to a February local news report.The city announced last November that it was considering selling the railway to NS for $1.62 billion to help fund city infrastructure improvements, according to news reports. NS would pay for the transaction through a combination of internal and external sources, the railroad said last year.Cincinnati has owned the land beneath the track for almost two centuries, but NS operates the rail line, according to NS.But before Cincinnati can sell the line to NS (NYSE: NSC), it needs the approval of city voters.City officials have spoken in favor of the project. Mayor Aftab Pureval said last November that “this is an historic opportunity to deliver great value to citizens of Cincinnati and realize a substantial return on the investment and foresight of our predecessors. We are fortunate that a number of events have brought us to this point and will provide for the transportation needs of our city for decades to come.”But some local groups, along with inter-union group Railroad Workers United (RWU), are urging voters to reject the sale. Some have argued that the city should fetch a higher price for the rail line, while others are critical of NS’ safety record given the Feb. 3 derailment of an NS train in East Palestine, Ohio.“Maintaining ownership of the railroad is a much better investment for the city in the long term, and selling the railroad to Norfolk Southern means that the city loses any ability to ensure that the railroad gets safely maintained,” said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, chief steward of AFGE Local 3840, in a Sept. 18 release. AFGE stands for American Federation of Government Employees. “Given these concerns, on behalf of the more than 200 NIOSH employees AFGE represents, we urge all eligible voters in the city to vote no on the referendum to sell the railway this November.”Story continuesRWU has advocated for public ownership of the railroads, saying that selling the rail line would be a lost opportunity for Cincinnati. The group held an online press conference about the sale last week.RWU teams up with local groups to protect the Cincinnati Southern, the only municipally-owned interstate mainline freight railroad. As NS aims for full ownership, Queen City residents rally to retain their historic railroad. We stand with them! https://t.co/JRY54nPDBJ— Railroad Workers United(@railroadworkers) September 18, 2023NS told FreightWaves last month that the line “is a critical Norfolk Southern artery linking the Midwest and the Southeast. It plays an important role in our network that serves more than half the U.S. population.” The line is on one of the highest-density segments on NS’ network. As many as 30 trains a day travel on the route, carrying all commodity types.“This agreement sets the framework for Norfolk Southern to own a core line in our network in perpetuity, allowing us to advance our strategic objectives of improving service, enhancing productivity, and creating an even stronger platform for accelerated growth, all while eliminating uncertainty around future control of the line and lease costs,” NS continued.Last week, federal regulators approved the sale of the Cincinnati Southern Railway to NS. The unanimous vote by the Surface Transportation Board last Tuesday also calls for Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway (CNOTP) — an NS subsidiary — to continue to operate and maintain the line, which spans from Cincinnati to Chattanooga, Tennessee.STB looks at whether a sale of the Cincinnati Southern Railway would cause a substantial lessening of competition or create a monopoly or restraint of trade. The board’s approval signals that no such issues were found.Should voters approve the transaction, the acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. If voters don’t approve it, the CNTOP will continue to operate the railway until the lease agreement expires in 2026. A new lease agreement could be arranged for the following period.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Norfolk Southern intends to acquire 300-plus-mile Midwest-Southeast short lineBiden holding Norfolk Southern accountable for East Palestine recoveryCN and Norfolk Southern unveil domestic intermodal serviceThe post Cincinnati voters to decide on sale of Cincinnati Southern Railway to NS appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the beverage industry and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Beverage Stocks with Dividends. Beverage stocks are companies that are primarily engaged in the production, distribution, and sale of beverages. These companies operate in the beverage industry, which encompasses a wide range of products, including soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, bottled water, energy drinks, and dairy-based beverages.After a summer of strong spending by American consumers, bars, hotels, and restaurants believe that the period of excessive spending by US consumers following the pandemic is probably over, according to a report by CNN. The Federal Reserve's recent ""Beige Book"" economic report mentioned that some of the Fed’s regional districts have observed that tourism activity had either reached its highest point or was starting to slow down. This is seen as an indication that consumer spending in the US, which plays a significant role in the country's overall economic activity, might be changing in the upcoming months. One of the main reasons for this slowdown is growing inflation and economic challenges. According to RSM US, consumers are buying store-brand products to save money. Food companies that used to do well by selling high-quality and natural products are now facing challenges because their costs are going up.However, the industry has experienced rapid growth over the years. According to the Food and Beverages Global Market Report 2023, the global food and beverage industry grew at a CAGR of 7.3% in 2023, reaching 7,221.73 billion. The report further mentioned that the global food and beverages market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% by 2027.Also Read: 25 Largest Beverage Companies in the Word in 2023The food and beverage industry has been experiencing various trends and growth patterns in different segments. In one of the recent developments, the major food companies around the world are making commitments to reduce emissions throughout their entire supply chain, Forbes reported. The report further mentioned that most of the emissions, typically over 90%, come from ""Scope 3 emissions."" These emissions are not created directly by the company but by the companies they work with, like suppliers, carriers, and partners who help make their products. In the food and beverage industry, farmers play a crucial role as suppliers. If these farmers don't adopt more sustainable practices when growing crops, the big food companies won't be able to meet their goals for reducing carbon emissions.Story continuesInvestors have increasingly turned their focus to stocks in the ever-evolving food and beverage industry. Though the S&amp;P Food &amp; Beverage Select Industry Index is underperforming the broader market this year, major beverage stocks are producing positive returns for shareholders. Companies like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are some of the best beverage stocks among investors because they pay dividends to shareholders.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now. Dividend Kings are companies that have a remarkable track record of consistently increasing their dividends to shareholders for close to 50 years or more. Achieving the status of a Dividend King is a significant accomplishment and demonstrates the company's financial stability and ability to generate consistent cash flow. While investors typically like it when a company increases its dividend payments, this is not the only reason they invest in that company. Historically, stocks of companies that consistently raise their dividends have also performed exceptionally well, bringing investors’ attention toward such equities.According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1973, companies that have either increased or started paying dividends have seen the highest returns compared to other stocks. These returns have been achieved with considerably less price fluctuation or volatility. The report mentioned that during this period, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return while dividend cutters returned 3.95% to shareholders.  The market is also favorable for dividends because a robust U.S. economy has allowed companies to increase their profits and cash reserves, leading to record-high levels of cash in their accounts.Also read: Dividend Stock Portfolio: 15 Stocks To Buy According to RedditIn the first half of the year, dividend stocks faced a setback as investors flocked toward fast-growing tech stocks. However, as investment trends shifted and market sentiment became more uncertain, dividend stocks became attractive again. The data from the second quarter of 2023 supports this idea, as global dividends have increased. According to Janus Henderson, 88% of companies worldwide either raised or maintained their dividends in the second quarter. This added up to a total of $568.1 billion in dividend payments globally since the beginning of the year. The report also mentioned that 98% of the US companies either raised or held their dividends steady during the quarter.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are some of the companies that have raised their payouts for years, becoming top choices for investors. In this article, we have discussed some of the best dividend kings to buy now.Our Methodology:Achieving and maintaining Dividend King status is a sign of a company's ability to withstand economic downturns and market fluctuations. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds and picked dividend companies that have raised their dividends for 50 consecutive years or more. These companies have demonstrated resilience and financial stability over several decades.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $882.8 million.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”12. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49An American multinational diversified conglomerate, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is next on our list of the best dividend kings to buy now.

The technological advancement of fintech is undoubtedly a great example of all the efforts being made by the companies participating in this sector to facilitate and streamline all the financial processes we perform day after day, both payments of everything we consume or use in our daily routine, as loans or any other financial transaction, whether personal or business. Here are three top fintech Stocks that are making incredible movements with substantial growth, which can allow us to obtain considerable gains by including them in our portfolio. Let’s take a look.Fintech Stocks: Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWhat makes Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) particularly attractive as a financial technology stock to investors is its recent introduction of QuickBooks Money, an all-in-one banking and payments solution designed for small businesses.A standout feature of QuickBooks Money is that it charges no monthly fee and requires no minimum balance. This means it allows small business owners to have complete control of their finances from anywhere, which can be a game changer for many entrepreneurs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntuit has been on a positive trajectory in terms of its financial results. In the fourth quarter, the company posted a 12% growth in total revenue to $2.7 billion. Revenue from the Small Business and Self-Employed Group increased by an impressive 21% to $2.1 billion.Revenue from the Online Ecosystem, another critical segment, also grew by 21%. However, it should be noted that Credit Karma revenues experienced an 11% decline, and Consumer Group revenues fell by 12%.In addition to their product innovations, they are making strategic financial moves. The company recently announced a senior notes offering totaling $4 billion. This offering comprises different maturity dates and interest rates, including 5.250% notes due 2026, 5.125% notes due 2028, 5.200% notes due 2033, and 5.500% notes due 2053.Story continuesMercadoLibre (MELI)mercado libre boxSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.comMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), the Latin American e-commerce giant, is a company that has given a lot to talk about. Why? Because it has been growing by leaps and bounds and diversifying into areas such as finance and insurance. That’s just the tip of the iceberg about why I think this is one of the best fintech stocks.Imagine a place where you can buy and sell almost anything online, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), but focused on Latin America. It connects sellers and buyers, facilitating all kinds of transactions. But it doesn’t stop there.Its growth is impressive. Their net revenues reached $3.4 billion, up 57.2% over the previous year. This shows that they are conquering a growing market in Latin America. They are also profitable, with operating income of $558 million and a healthy margin of 16.3%.Their digital payments platform, Mercado Pago, is a gem. They handled a total payment volume of $42.1 billion, almost double the previous year! This shows their strength in the fintech world.The latest in their portfolio is the insurance business. In less than four years, they attracted five million customers. This is due to solid investments in technology and a focus on the needs of low- and middle-income users, who often lack access to essential insurance.In the latest quarter, its net earnings increased a staggering 113% to $261.9 million due to higher sales volume and user growth. In the fintech sector, they added 7.1 million new users in the last year, reaching an active base of 45.3 million users.LendingTree (TREE)Lending Tree (TREE) website under magnifying glassSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.comLendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE) is a prominent player in the financial technology space, and it’s a stock worth following this fall. Imagine it as your go-to online marketplace for financial services in the U.S., like a virtual financial mall where you can find loans, insurance, credit cards, and more.Recently, they reported their financial situation. They earned a substantial $182.5 million in revenue, like their payroll. However, after covering all their bills, they ended up with a slight net loss of $0.1 million or $0.01 per share, which shows they are working on their financial health.Their marketing efforts paid off, as they pocketed $76.5 million after accounting for marketing expenses. Their adjusted net income per share of $1.14 indicates a positive financial outlook. In addition, their adjusted EBITDA of $26.7 million suggests that they effectively manage their day-to-day operations.Most interesting is their recent move: repurchasing $190 million of their convertible bonds. This signifies their dedication to improving their financial structure. They have disbursed $156.4 million in cash for this, a part of a strategy to optimize their financial situation. They are also modifying some financial agreements, which could lead to the sale of some shares in the market. However, it still remains among the best fintech stocks, in my opinion.As of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA, the first rapid antigen test that detects COVID-19 to be awarded FDA market clearance through the FDA’s De Novo process, is now the first rapid antigen test also to receive CLIA waiver.The test, intended for prescription use only, can be used in CLIA-waived point-of-care settings.The latest waiver is likely to significantly boost QuidelOrtho’s Point of Care business unit.A Few Words About the TestThe enhanced Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA Test kit includes other upgraded features, such as pre-filled reagent vials, improved ergonomic sample extraction and a dropper design for easy dispensing of patient samples into the test cassette sample well. The Sofia 2 instrument also offers two distinct workflows — WALK AWAY Mode and READ NOW Mode.The results obtained via the test kit are for the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein antigen, which is generally detectable in upper respiratory specimens during the acute phase of infection.The Sofia 2 system connects to Virena, QuidelOrtho’s data management system, which provides aggregated, de-identified testing and surveillance data in near real time.Significance of the WaiverFollowing the CLIA waiver, the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA is deemed to be simple and has a low risk of error. Hence, it no longer requires administration by trained clinical laboratory personnel, thereby opening broader use in any point-of-care setting equipped with Sofia 2 instruments.The Sofia 2 analyzer utilizes QuidelOrtho’s proprietary fluorescent chemistry design, intuitive graphical user interface and optics system to provide an accurate, objective and automated result in 10 minutes. This is a 33% reduction from the breakthrough 15-minute processing time achieved in the first iterations of the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA assay.Story continuesPer management, the receipt of the FDA’s CLIA waiver qualifies as a trifecta/milestone of innovation, advancement and accessibility in the in vitro diagnostics space. This is reflective of QuidelOrtho’s efforts to aid customers in reducing costs and speeding workflows, thus delivering improved patient care.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Precedence Research, the global diagnostic testing market was valued at $165.58 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to exceed $348.75 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 8.6%. Factors like the increasing use of point-of-care diagnostic products and the rising elderly population leading to an increase in the chance of developing a wide range of illnesses (including diabetes) are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory achievement will likely provide a significant impetus to QuidelOrtho’s business.Notable DevelopmentLast month, QuidelOrtho reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an uptick in the company’s overall top line. The company recorded a continued uptick in Sofia’s non-COVID pull-through and growth in QuidelOrtho’s integrated installed base and automation.

We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Cincinnati Financial has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Progressive has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that CINF has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.CINF currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21.42, while PGR has a forward P/E of 30.64. We also note that CINF has a PEG ratio of 1.21. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PGR currently has a PEG ratio of 1.23.Another notable valuation metric for CINF is its P/B ratio of 1.52. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PGR has a P/B of 5.17.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help CINF earn a Value grade of B, while PGR has been given a Value grade of C.CINF stands above PGR thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CINF is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre breaks down the performances of small cap stocks while also taking a look at the mixed industrial sector.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: To some investors, the recent downward dip is a little more than a buying opportunity. But should the decline in industrials and small caps be taken more seriously? With us now, we've got Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre to evaluate this further. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hey there. Well, I think it's appropriate to look at the small cap market overall, and we can branch out into some of the different sectors. Small caps usually lead on the way up out of a bull market. However, they did not do that this year with that bull market that started last October. In fact, you can see the Russell 2000 going back two years here has basically been trading sideways for about 3/4 of that. And after that liftoff from the October lows last year, well, we got a retest of those lows earlier this year, and we may be getting another one.Now I think it's really interesting because there's a lot of talk about concentration in the markets right now. And I wanted to show the Russell 2000 versus the S&amp;P 500 equal weight. Now why am I doing it this way? The equal weighted S&amp;P 500 a bit different than how we-- different than how we normally look at it. The equal weight gives every share one basic vote. And we don't have as much influence by the mega caps that we would because of their outsized influence in the regularly calculated S&amp;P 500. So this cyan line, which is the equal weight, you're going to see very closely tracks the purple line, which is the Russell 2000.Now the Russell 2000 might swing a little bit higher. It has a higher beta, as they say. But nevertheless, I think it's really interesting to look when you have the S&amp;P 500 and you have the mid-caps and the small cap index, you put all of those together, it's the S&amp;P 1,500. And the only thing that's really moving right now are seven of those, at least on a year to date basis. Also want to show you the opposite picture. Here's the NASDAQ 100, which is very heavily weighted towards those mega caps. In the purple line, you can see how that has soared this year and has really held on to a lot of its gains, while the Russell 2000, while the small caps are way down here.So that just kind of highlights this concentration issue. And going forward with higher rates and a higher dollar, a lot of these markets do not like that setup, especially the higher growth stocks, especially those mega caps. So let me bring it back to the industrial sphere and we can take a look at what has happened on a year to date basis. And you can see there are some clear winners and losers here. The number one GE. Don't count out GE. Remember that stock and in the midst of their turnaround strategy. Here's a look at what they've done over the last two years. You can see really moved off that October low that I was just highlighting a moment ago for the general market, but it has really surged off of that.Here's a look at GE over the last five years. So all the more impressive. Now it's not that way for everyone. I think we've been talking about Alcoa, that's down 40%. I'll move on to Raytheon Technologies. That has been basically going sideways over the last five years. But I'll say this, as much as it is a headwind for growth stocks, these higher rates, typically, these are good things for the cyclical stocks. Now it depends on the shape of the overall yield curve. But if we are going higher for longer and if we do have a robust economy, the thinking is the cyclical stocks will come back into favor. And so I think that note is kind of touching on that, guys.]"

The GF Value Line provides a snapshot of the fair value at which a stock should ideally be traded. If a stock's price significantly exceeds the GF Value Line, it is likely overvalued and may offer poor future returns.

Supermarket prices for items in each of these categories were sharply higher so far this month versus the same period last year.""Where there are good private label alternatives you see a big shift towards private labels,"" said Anton Delbarre, chief economist at retail trade group Eurocommerce.""And what you also see is some people actually do eat less, shower less, clean the house less, or they use a little less product for their dishwasher or their washing machine.""President Emmanuel Macron's government is due to address grocery inflation in its budget on Wednesday, with legislation to bring forward annual negotiations between food producers and supermarkets. It hopes price cuts can then take effect from Jan. 15 rather than March 1 as usual.Food makers like Nestle and Pepsico have been criticised by supermarkets and politicians for not ""co-operating"" in pricing negotiations, and for reducing pack sizes of products.Carrefour, which has pricing power as France's No.2 supermarket operator, last week slapped ""shrinkflation"" labels on products that are getting smaller with no price cuts.Major brands like Ariel laundry detergent and Dove soaps have for years dominated the market versus retailers' private label goods.But the NielsenIQ data shows volumes for private label personal products are inching up while those for big brands decline. For instance, shower gel volumes fell 6% overall and 10% for big brands but rose 14% for private label products.Story continuesSimilarly, while laundry detergent volumes were down about 2% across the category and fell 10% for big brands, they surged 28% for private label brands.Where people bought less shower gel, tampons, dishwashing products, laundry detergent and toilet paper made by big brands in the year to Sept. 17, they bought more of each type of product made by retailers' private label brands.While grocers and the government have been vocal about their frustrations in the media and at hearings with lawmakers, consumer goods companies have largely kept quiet, leaving trade groups to speak on their behalf. Unilever declined to comment and P&amp;G did not respond to a request for comment for this story.""Consumer goods volumes are weak because of the weak economy in France,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard warned in August that high prices had forced consumers to make massive cuts to spending on essential goods.Bompard, who has for months slashed prices to win shoppers away from rivals, said then that Carrefour was free to sell washing powder at a 60% discount, but would not be able to do so after a cap on the promotions retailers can offer becomes law.He said the change would limit Carrefour's bargaining power with large suppliers like Procter &amp; Gamble, Henkel and Unilever.Delbarre at Eurocommerce said some of the change in what shoppers buy was likely to persist even after the cost-of-living squeeze eases.""People are actually rationing, in part because of decreased purchasing power, and also because salaries always lag behind inflation,"" he said. ""Once salaries catch up to inflation that effect should probably diminish, but some of it will remain because people create new habits.""(Reporting by Richa Naidu and Helen Reid; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Catherine Evans)]"

262,120b7967-6f4d-3528-aadb-847a47def480,ORLY,2023-09-26,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-oreilly-124600876.html,1695645960,STORY,"['AZO', 'ORLY', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 25, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses O'Reilly Automotive ORLY and AutoZone AZO.Industry: Auto PartsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2154041/2-auto-parts-retailers-well-poised-to-face-industry-challengesThe repercussions of the UAW strike affecting the Detroit 3 automakers are expected to extend their reach into the Zacks Automotive- Retail and Wholesale- Parts industry, emphasizing the need for swift resolution in labor negotiations to minimize the fallout. Additionally, apprehensions have arisen due to the Fed's indication of raising interest rates once more by year-end to curb inflation. These factors, combined with supply chain complications, a challenging labor landscape, and logistical hurdles, may impede the prospects of industry. Despite the promising shift toward green vehicles, the specter of elevated operational costs looms.To navigate this uncertain landscape, businesses must enact cost-saving strategies, optimize their supply chains and remain adaptable to evolving market dynamics to uphold their competitive edge. Industry participants such as O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone appear better-positioned to confront these challenges.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry players execute several functions. These include manufacturing, retailing, distribution and installation of vehicle parts, equipment and accessories. Vehicle parts and accessories include seat covers, antifreeze, engine additives, wiper blades, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts and fuel pumps. Consumers have two options.They can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own (the 'do-it-yourself' or 'DIY' segment) or take the assistance of a professional repair facility (the 'do-it-for me' or 'DIFM' segment). The industry is highly competitive and undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Story continuesFactors Influencing the IndustryDisruptions Loom Amid UAW Strike: The UAW strike against Detroit Three automakers —including General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis — carries potential repercussions that extend well beyond the immediate production standstill. While the immediate consequences are evident in the disruption of high-demand vehicle manufacturing, such as Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler, and Chevrolet Colorado, the ripple effects could be profound.One significant impact could be felt by auto retail parts companies. The strike's potential to halt parts production threatens to disrupt the supply chain, resulting in limited availability of components at dealerships for routine maintenance and repairs. This could cause inconvenience for vehicle owners and lead to longer wait times for servicing, potentially damaging customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.Navigating Electrification's Challenges and Opportunities: As the automotive landscape shifts toward more advanced and technologically intricate vehicles, consumers are increasingly seeking professional assistance, presenting a fresh array of opportunities for industry players. However, this transformation also entails escalating capital expenditure and research and development expenses due to the development of cutting-edge technological platforms and sophisticated tools.In light of these shifts, the auto retail parts sector must strategically chart its course to fully leverage these opportunities in a dynamic market environment. The adoption of omnichannel marketing and digitalization is driving up operational costs, potentially curbing profit margins.Inflationary Concerns: Inflation poses a challenge to the auto retail parts industry. The combination of an inflationary environment and supply chain constraints is driving up operational costs, impacting profit margins. The Federal Reserve's recent decision to maintain interest rates, albeit the possibility of one more hike before the year end, further compounds the industry's woes, as high interest rates can hinder growth and increase borrowing costs. Rising expenses, exacerbated by distribution inefficiencies, labor difficulties and global logistics issues are putting pressure on industry players.Zacks Industry Rank Paints a Lackluster PictureThe Zacks Auto Retail &amp; Wholesale Parts industry is a four-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #217, which places it in the bottom 11% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates grim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a tepid earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. Over the past six months, the industry's earnings estimate for 2023 has declined 4.7%.Despite the bleak prospects of the industry, we will present a couple of stocks that may hold their ground. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Tops Sector, Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Auto Retail and Wholesale Parts industry has outperformed the Auto, Tires and Truck sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has gained 12.4% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500 growth of 17.4%. Meanwhile, the sector has lost 3.7% over the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio.Based on trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 66.26X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 13.13X and the sector's 13.25X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 67.51X and as low as 15.90X, with the median being 23.98X.2 Stocks to WatchO'Reilly: O'Reilly is one of the noted retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. The company has been generating record revenues for 30 consecutive years due to growth in the auto parts market and store expansion efforts.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with EXR. Click here to check it out. ORLY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ORLYAs of 2023-09-25, O'Reilly Automotive Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $1126.25. It's currently trading at a price of $936.02. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 16.89%. The company is modestly undervalued.Beyond Market Price: Uncovering O'Reilly Automotive Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. O'Reilly Automotive Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$36.04GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.5%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 21.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=618.97Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=643.34Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=1126.25Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $1301.28. This valuation indicates that the O'Reilly Automotive Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 28.07%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

In 2023, the company expects positive adjusted operating income growth with sales growth. Healthy agent recruiting and productive small case sales are likely to benefit the sales.The insurer boasts a solid capital position.

Corebridge Financial is expected to receive a total consideration of £460 million in cash per the deal. The divestiture is expected to close by the first half of 2024, subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals.This move bodes well for CRBG, intensifying its focus on its Life &amp; Retirement unit in the United States and streamlining the portfolio. The company expects to leverage the attractive qualities of the U.S. business to deliver earnings growth and value to shareholders. CRBG acquired the UK Life business in 2014 and since then, built it into an established Life insurance company.The divestiture builds on CRBG’s strategic initiatives to focus on its U.S. operations. The company announced its intent to sell Laya Healthcare Limited on August 2023 to AXA, which is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2023. CRBG expects to use the proceeds from this transaction to pay special dividends to shareholders. The U.S. Life and Retirement market is the fastest and largest growing market, and the company’s focus on scaling this by withdrawing its resources from other markets is expected to benefit the company in the long run.The company targets a return on equity (ROE) of 12-14% by 2024. It recorded an ROE of 12% in the first half of 2023. It also aims to achieve a 60-65% payout ratio by 2024. Streamlining operations should help the company in reducing costs and improving margins. Corebridge’s Forward program is also delivering well on its objective to attain $400 million in exit run-rate savings by 2024.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCorebridge Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The decision came with a strong warning that inflation is still high and another rate hike would be required.This saw a huge selloff last week, leading to all three major indexes ending in the red. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the week 1.9%, 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively, lower. Meanwhile, the  2-year and 10-year Treasury yields jumped to their highest levels since 2006 and 2007, respectively.Understandably, fears of a recession have once again escalated. It would thus be wise to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank that are likely to strengthen one’s portfolio.Markets Turn Volatile AgainThe Fed left interest rates intact in September, which now keeps its benchmark rate in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The central bank has so far increased interest rates by 525 basis points on 11 occasions since March 2022. September was only the second instance during this period that the Fed kept it unaltered.However, despite the sharp increase in interest rates, which saw inflation steeply declining over the past year, it remains more than double the Fed’s 2% target rate.The Fed has thus said that another interest rate of a quarter percentage point would be required, which is likely to come in its November meeting before they start cutting interest rates from 2024.However, the Federal Reserve also cut its forecast for interest rate cuts in 2024 from four to two. The hawkish stance has raised concerns of a slowdown, which has been taking a toll on stocks.Also, inflation rose again in August. The consumer price index (CPI) reading for August rose 0.6% month over month, higher than July’s rise of 0.2%.Year over year, CPI jumped 3.7% in August, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.6%. This is also the first time since February 2022 that CPI has increased more than 0.6% month over month.Story continuesCore CPI, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose 0.3%, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI jumped 4.3%.The sudden rise in inflation in August was largely driven by the jump in oil prices, which has left investors worried. Understandably, market volatility is going to stay for a longer time or at least till the time the Fed gives a clearer picture of the economic health of the nation in the near term.Our ChoicesInvestors should thus consider stocks that offer risk-adjusted returns like American Water Works Company, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the beverage industry and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Beverage Stocks with Dividends. Beverage stocks are companies that are primarily engaged in the production, distribution, and sale of beverages. These companies operate in the beverage industry, which encompasses a wide range of products, including soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, bottled water, energy drinks, and dairy-based beverages.After a summer of strong spending by American consumers, bars, hotels, and restaurants believe that the period of excessive spending by US consumers following the pandemic is probably over, according to a report by CNN. The Federal Reserve's recent ""Beige Book"" economic report mentioned that some of the Fed’s regional districts have observed that tourism activity had either reached its highest point or was starting to slow down. This is seen as an indication that consumer spending in the US, which plays a significant role in the country's overall economic activity, might be changing in the upcoming months. One of the main reasons for this slowdown is growing inflation and economic challenges. According to RSM US, consumers are buying store-brand products to save money. Food companies that used to do well by selling high-quality and natural products are now facing challenges because their costs are going up.However, the industry has experienced rapid growth over the years. According to the Food and Beverages Global Market Report 2023, the global food and beverage industry grew at a CAGR of 7.3% in 2023, reaching 7,221.73 billion. The report further mentioned that the global food and beverages market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% by 2027.Also Read: 25 Largest Beverage Companies in the Word in 2023The food and beverage industry has been experiencing various trends and growth patterns in different segments. In one of the recent developments, the major food companies around the world are making commitments to reduce emissions throughout their entire supply chain, Forbes reported. The report further mentioned that most of the emissions, typically over 90%, come from ""Scope 3 emissions."" These emissions are not created directly by the company but by the companies they work with, like suppliers, carriers, and partners who help make their products. In the food and beverage industry, farmers play a crucial role as suppliers. If these farmers don't adopt more sustainable practices when growing crops, the big food companies won't be able to meet their goals for reducing carbon emissions.Story continuesInvestors have increasingly turned their focus to stocks in the ever-evolving food and beverage industry. Though the S&amp;P Food &amp; Beverage Select Industry Index is underperforming the broader market this year, major beverage stocks are producing positive returns for shareholders. Companies like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are some of the best beverage stocks among investors because they pay dividends to shareholders.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now. Dividend Kings are companies that have a remarkable track record of consistently increasing their dividends to shareholders for close to 50 years or more. Achieving the status of a Dividend King is a significant accomplishment and demonstrates the company's financial stability and ability to generate consistent cash flow. While investors typically like it when a company increases its dividend payments, this is not the only reason they invest in that company. Historically, stocks of companies that consistently raise their dividends have also performed exceptionally well, bringing investors’ attention toward such equities.According to a report by Hartford Funds, since 1973, companies that have either increased or started paying dividends have seen the highest returns compared to other stocks. These returns have been achieved with considerably less price fluctuation or volatility. The report mentioned that during this period, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return while dividend cutters returned 3.95% to shareholders.  The market is also favorable for dividends because a robust U.S. economy has allowed companies to increase their profits and cash reserves, leading to record-high levels of cash in their accounts.Also read: Dividend Stock Portfolio: 15 Stocks To Buy According to RedditIn the first half of the year, dividend stocks faced a setback as investors flocked toward fast-growing tech stocks. However, as investment trends shifted and market sentiment became more uncertain, dividend stocks became attractive again. The data from the second quarter of 2023 supports this idea, as global dividends have increased. According to Janus Henderson, 88% of companies worldwide either raised or maintained their dividends in the second quarter. This added up to a total of $568.1 billion in dividend payments globally since the beginning of the year. The report also mentioned that 98% of the US companies either raised or held their dividends steady during the quarter.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are some of the companies that have raised their payouts for years, becoming top choices for investors.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”12. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49An American multinational diversified conglomerate, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is next on our list of the best dividend kings to buy now.

The decision came with a strong warning that inflation is still high and another rate hike would be required.This saw a huge selloff last week, leading to all three major indexes ending in the red. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the week 1.9%, 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively, lower. Meanwhile, the  2-year and 10-year Treasury yields jumped to their highest levels since 2006 and 2007, respectively.Understandably, fears of a recession have once again escalated. It would thus be wise to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank that are likely to strengthen one’s portfolio.Markets Turn Volatile AgainThe Fed left interest rates intact in September, which now keeps its benchmark rate in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The central bank has so far increased interest rates by 525 basis points on 11 occasions since March 2022. September was only the second instance during this period that the Fed kept it unaltered.However, despite the sharp increase in interest rates, which saw inflation steeply declining over the past year, it remains more than double the Fed’s 2% target rate.The Fed has thus said that another interest rate of a quarter percentage point would be required, which is likely to come in its November meeting before they start cutting interest rates from 2024.However, the Federal Reserve also cut its forecast for interest rate cuts in 2024 from four to two. The hawkish stance has raised concerns of a slowdown, which has been taking a toll on stocks.Also, inflation rose again in August. The consumer price index (CPI) reading for August rose 0.6% month over month, higher than July’s rise of 0.2%.Year over year, CPI jumped 3.7% in August, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.6%. This is also the first time since February 2022 that CPI has increased more than 0.6% month over month.Story continuesCore CPI, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose 0.3%, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI jumped 4.3%.The sudden rise in inflation in August was largely driven by the jump in oil prices, which has left investors worried. Understandably, market volatility is going to stay for a longer time or at least till the time the Fed gives a clearer picture of the economic health of the nation in the near term.Our ChoicesInvestors should thus consider stocks that offer risk-adjusted returns like American Water Works Company, Inc.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) to treat children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The target action date for the FDA decision is January 31, 2024. Dupixent is the first and only treatment in the U.S. approved for children and adults aged 12 years and older with EoE, weighing at least 40kg.The sBLA is supported by data from the Phase 3 EoE KIDS trial (Parts A and B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 with EoE. In Part A, the primary endpoint was met for the proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission (defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) at 16 weeks for tiered dosing regimens based on body weight, compared to placebo. Part B was an active treatment extension period evaluating Dupixent for an additional 36 weeks and showed Dupixent maintained histologic remission for 52 weeks, a secondary endpoint. Dupixent also led to increases in body weight for age percentile, which was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint in Part A and a secondary endpoint in Part B.Safety results in Parts A and B of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its FDA-approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40kg. Adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent compared to placebo were COVID-19, rash, headache, viral gastroenteritis, diarrhea and nausea.Story continuesPriority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic, progressive disease driven by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. In children, common symptoms of EoE include heartburn, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, trouble swallowing, food refusal and failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development and can cause food-related fear and anxiety, which can persist through adulthood. Dietary adjustments, including the elimination of many foods, are the standard treatment for EoE, as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors, swallowed topical corticosteroids, or in severe cases, a feeding tube, which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Continuous treatment of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease recurrence.About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE and prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 600,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies for rare and ultrarare genetic diseases, today announced the approval of Evkeeza® (evinacumab) in Canada. Evkeeza® was approved by Health Canada as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 5 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and will be commercially available in Canada effective 25-November-2023. Evkeeza is a first-of-its-kind treatment for HoFH and is the first monoclonal antibody inhibiting the angiopoietin-like 3 protein (ANGPTL3). Evkeeza is delivered via 60-minute intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. The treatment is now available to prescribe for patients with HoFH in Canada.“The approval and launch of Evkeeza in Canada for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia exemplifies our commitment to bring innovative therapies for people living with rare and ultrarare genetic diseases,” said Monty Keast, Vice President and General Manager at Ultragenyx Canada. “We look forward to working collaboratively with health care providers, the HoFH patient community and payers from across the country to make this potentially life-changing therapy accessible to people living with this serious disease.”“HoFH is a severe atherosclerotic disease associated with premature cardiovascular morbidity, which most often does not adequately respond to cholesterol-lowering treatment currently available,” said Prof. Daniel Gaudet, Lipidologist and Director of the Severe Lipid Disorders Unit at the Community Genetic Medicine Center, Department of Medicine, Université de Montréal. “Our experience in recent years in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, clearly demonstrates that in combination with diet and other low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies, evinacumab represents an effective option to substantially lower the levels of LDL-cholesterol and other atherogenic lipoproteins in HoFH patients.”Story continuesAbout Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)HoFH, also known as homozygous FH, is the most severe form of inherited hypercholesterolemia. This ultrarare disease affects 1 in 300,000 people worldwide. There is a founder effect in the French-Canadian population with a prevalence estimated to be 1 in 250,000 people. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia runs in families and is usually passed down by both father and mother. People with this condition have extremely high levels of LDL-cholesterol (‘bad cholesterol’) from birth. Such high levels can lead to heart attacks, heart valve disease, or other problems at an early age. For more information about HoFH please go to www.hofhdisease.ca.About Evkeeza® (evinacumab)Evinacumab, the active substance in Evkeeza, attaches to a protein in the body called ANGPTL3 and blocks its effects. ANGPTL3 is involved in controlling cholesterol levels and blocking its effect reduces the level of cholesterol in the blood. Evkeeza is delivered via an infusion every 4 weeks.Evkeeza is approved by Health Canada as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 5 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The effects of Evkeeza on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been determined. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) discovered and developed Evkeeza, and solely commercializes the product in the U.S. Ultragenyx is responsible for commercialization efforts for Evkeeza in countries outside of the U.S.IndicationIn Canada, EVKEEZA® (evinacumab for injection) is indicated as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 5 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).The effects of Evkeeza on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been determined.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR EVKEEZA® (evinacumab) INFUSIONTo help avoid side effects and ensure proper use, talk to your healthcare professional before you take Evkeeza. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and infusion reactions (e.g., infusion site pruritus), have been reported with Evkeeza. If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Evkeeza, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.The most common adverse reactions to Evkeeza were nasopharyngitis (13.7% vs. 13.0% in placebo), influenzalike illness (7.7% vs. 5.6% in placebo), dizziness (6.0% vs. 0% in placebo), back pain (5.1% vs. 3.7% in placebo), and nausea (5.1% vs. 1.9% in placebo). Fatigue (15%) was identified as an adverse reaction to Evkeeza for pediatric patients aged ≥ 5 to 11 years only.Who should not use Evkeeza?Evkeeza may not be used if you are allergic to evinacumab or to any of the ingredients in Evkeeza.If you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant, or plan to become pregnant, ask your healthcare professional for advice before taking Evkeeza.

The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company's cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives.Amazon.com's strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Sares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the year-to-date period (+5.0% vs. -15.6%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the second quarter, this jet giant booked 460 net commercial airplane orders and recorded a 10% hike in service revenues.A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing's growth. The company holds a strong solvency position in the near term. However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term.Further, the company has been incurring notable abnormal production cost in relation to production quality issues for 787 jets that may hurt its future results. Its dispute with Embraer over termination of the earlier made joint venture might cause Boeing to incur some loss in the future.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Regeneron shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+14.1% vs. -14.8%).  The company maintains momentum on asthma drug Dupixent's stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications. Growth in Dupixent through additional label expansions and a promising late-stage pipeline set the momentum for further development.The approval of Libtayo for additional indications is likely to drive the drug's sales and diversify the company's portfolio. Additionally, the company received a significant boost with the FDA approval of a higher dose of aflibercept at 8mg.Regeneron has a deep pipeline and the development of additional drugs will be an incremental boost to the company. However, lead drug Eylea sales are under pressure due to increasing competition. A decline in Eylea sales will hurt Regeneron's performance.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Boston Scientific Corp. and Waste Management, Inc.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that it has successfully completed its acquisition of Decibel Therapeutics, Inc., strengthening the company’s gene therapy and auditory programs.The acquisition of Decibel builds on prior collaboration between the companies and includes three ongoing gene therapy programs targeting different forms of congenital, monogenic hearing loss. The most advanced clinical-stage candidate is DB-OTO, which is currently being studied in the global Phase 1/2 CHORDTM clinical trial, and is an investigational cell-selective, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy designed to provide durable, physiological hearing to individuals with profound, congenital hearing loss caused by mutations of the otoferlin gene. Preclinical programs include AAV.103 for people with GJB2-related hearing loss and AAV.104 for people with stereocilin (STRC)-related hearing loss.“After several years of successful collaboration, the integration of Decibel’s programs, capabilities and accomplished team will further bolster Regeneron’s genetic medicines portfolio and advance our mission of helping patients around the globe,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Board Co-Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron. “We will continue to strategically deploy capital by selectively pursuing deals that secure access to novel technologies and approaches that are complementary to our technologies, portfolio and strengths in research.”“As we advance Regeneron’s commitment to genetic medicine, we welcome our new colleagues and their important expertise in the biology of auditory disorders,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board Co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “In addition to DB-OTO, we have worked with Decibel to build a rich pipeline of programs targeting congenital hearing loss caused by single-gene mutations, including the more common GJB2 and STRC mutations. We are actively expanding our expertise in cutting-edge genetic medicine approaches, which currently includes gene silencing, gene editing and gene therapy technologies with the potential to address many serious and hard-to-treat diseases.”Story continuesThe tender offer by Regeneron for shares of Decibel expired one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on Friday, September 22, 2023. Computershare, the depository and paying agent for the tender offer, advised Regeneron that as of the tender offer expiration, a total of 19,797,530 shares had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, representing, together with the shares held by Regeneron, approximately 86.1% of the outstanding shares. As a result of the completion of the offer, all holders of shares that were validly tendered become entitled to $4.00 per share (without interest), with an additional non-tradeable contractual contingent value right (CVR) to receive up to $3.50 per share in cash upon achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones for Decibel’s lead investigational candidate, DB-OTO, within specified time periods. Subject to the terms of the CVR agreement (including adjustments for CVRs received in exchange for certain options with an exercise price greater than $4.00 per share), CVR holders will become entitled to receive contingent payments as follows: (i) $2.00 in cash, upon the fifth participant being administered with DB-OTO in a clinical trial on or prior to December 31, 2024 (the DB-OTO Milestone); and (ii) $1.50 in cash, upon (a) the first participant being administered with DB-OTO in a registration enabling trial (as defined in the CVR Agreement) or (b) acceptance for review of a Biologics License Application by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a Marketing Authorization Application by the European Medicines Agency or the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or an equivalent application by the applicable national regulatory authority in any of Germany, France, Italy or Spain for DB-OTO, whichever occurs first, on or prior to December 31, 2028; provided the DB-OTO Milestone is achieved on or prior to December 31, 2024.

DB-OTO is an investigational cell-selective, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy designed to provide durable, physiological hearing to individuals with profound, congenital hearing loss caused by mutations of the otoferlin gene. Preclinical programs include AAV.103 for people with GJB2-related hearing loss and AAV.104 for people with stereocilin (STRC)-related hearing loss.Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Board Co-Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron said that the integration of Decibel's programs will further bolster Regeneron's genetic medicines portfolio and advance their mission of helping patients around the globe.George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board Co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron also expressed his enthusiasm for the acquisition. He highlighted that they have worked with Decibel to build a rich pipeline of programs targeting congenital hearing loss caused by single-gene mutations, including the more common GJB2 and STRC mutations.The tender offer by Regeneron for shares of Decibel expired on Friday, leading to the successful acquisition. As a result of this transaction, all holders of shares that were validly tendered become entitled to $4.00 per share (without interest), with an additional non-tradeable contractual contingent value right (CVR) to receive up to $3.50 per share in cash upon achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones for Decibel's lead investigational candidate, DB-OTO.Story continuesRegeneron completed its acquisition of Decibel through a second-step merger of Symphony Acquisition Sub, Inc., with and into Decibel. As a result of the acquisition, Decibel common stock has ceased to be traded on the Nasdaq Global Market.Regeneron will reflect any changes to its 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP financial guidance as a result of this transaction in the guidance update to be provided in conjunction with Regeneron's third quarter 2023 earnings announcement.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

With already high interest rates, a sticky inflation problem and an uncertain economic outlook, many investors are taking a cautious approach for the rest of 2023.And there should be particular concern about companies that were beneficiaries of the unique economic conditions from 2020-22 and are not nearly as well-positioned going forward. It’s time to remove these three stocks to avoid from your portfolio now before their situations get a whole lot worse.Moderna (MRNA)Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comBiotech company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) develops and sells vaccines. It aims to commercialize vaccines for a wide variety of diseases. However, to date, virtually all of its success has been tied to its COVID-19 offering.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThere is an argument for owning some of the Covid pharma companies. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), for example, is much larger and more profitable today than it was prior to the onset of the pandemic. And Pfizer has plenty of other drugs in other fields to keep its profits steady even as Covid revenues dry up.For Moderna, however, it’s hard to see what the company’s next act will be. MRNA had virtually no revenues before the launch of its Covid vaccine, and shares traded for just $20 or so.Now, its revenues have plunged from $19 billion in 2022 to just an estimated $7.2 billion this year. And revenues will almost certainly continue to slump as vaccine demand fades. Moderna is already unprofitable once again, and its losses should widen as revenues further decline. Unless Moderna comes up with another blockbuster vaccine in a different field, it’s hard to see how MRNA stock doesn’t collapse going forward.Peloton Interactive (PTON)Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefrontSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPeloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) was another pandemic-era winner that is now long past its prime.Story continuesIt made all the sense in the world to buy expensive home bikes when gyms were closed. However, with the economy now open, the appeal of expensive home fitness equipment has markedly declined.That’s especially true since Peloton relies on an expensive subscription-based model for delivering its exercise classes. With consumers developing subscription fatigue due to the vast number of monthly bill products, more niche products like Peloton are in danger.Peloton stock sank in August following a product recall that led to a wave of customer subscription cancellations. And things went from bad to worse this week, with PTON stock hitting new 52-week lows after the disclosure that the firm’s chief financial officer (CFO) sold 10,215 shares of stock. It’s often wise to avoid stocks with insider selling.The Gap (GPS)A close-up view of a Gap (GPS) sign in the window of a Los Angeles, California mall.Source: Alex Millauer / Shutterstock.comRetailers also face heavy headwinds as 2024 approaches. High inflation, the resumption of student loan payments and a fading economic outlook will pressure consumer spending.Clothing retailers like The Gap (NYSE:GPS) had a wonderful opportunity in 2021 and 2022. Folks went into the newly reopening world wanting to look their best. Consumers had money to spend at the time, buying discretionary goods at an accelerated clip.Despite this, The Gap was not able to cash in. Revenues only marginally nudged upward from $16.6 billion in fiscal year 2019 to $16.7 billion in FY 2022. Revenues then declined to $15.6 billion in the already-completed FY 2023, and analysts see that plunging to just $14.7 billion in FY 2024. Despite a vigorous shopping environment and the ability to raise prices across the board, Gap watched its business shrink significantly. Recent earnings reports have been negative as well.Gap has a chunky amount of long-term debt on its balance sheet, further limiting its options as it attempts to turn the business around. However, given the struggles of the mall shopping ecosystem overall, Gap faces a significant challenge going forward. The firm is currently paying a large 6.07% dividend yield. However, given Gap’s slumping profitability, don’t be surprised by a dividend cut, which would set the stage for a big decline in the price of GPS stock.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

281,7332bba7-0d60-3aba-afee-5f2408dbcc1e,CSCO,2023-09-26,Analysis-Cisco's $28 billion Splunk deal may ignite software deal frenzy,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-ciscos-28-billion-splunk-101219225.html,1695723139,STORY,"['CSCO', 'SPLK']","[By Milana VinnNEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems' $28 billion deal for Splunk is likely to prompt other technology giants to splash out on similar acquisitions of software vendors with predictable subscription revenue, investment bankers and analysts say.Splunk, a cybersecurity and data analytics firm, was in the process of shifting its business model from licensing its software to charging for subscriptions when it announced an agreement last week to sell itself to Cisco, making it the third-largest software acquisition of all time.Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, who has been expanding his company's services offerings to compensate for its moribund telecommunications equipment business, told analysts that the $4 billion in annual recurring revenue that Splunk would bring from its subscriptions was a key driver behind the deal.This underscores how Splunk's subscription revenue-focused peers, such as Elastic NV, Datadog, Crowdstrike Holdings and Dynatrace, are potential acquisition targets for technology conglomerates such as Microsoft, Adobe and Oracle, which are grappling with corporate customers seeking to cut spending, the bankers and analysts said.Microsoft, Adobe and Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The improving outlook for software mergers and acquisitions is a welcome boost for dealmakers, which have seen activity in the technology sector drop 61% year-to-date in the first 8 months of 2023 to $231.5 billion, according to LSEG data.Dealmaking in the software sector has been dominated by private equity firms over the past year facing little competition from technology giants. New Relic, a Splunk competitor, agreed in July to be sold to private equity firms Francisco Partners and TPG Inc for $6.5 billion.David Chen, co-head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, predicts that a rally in the Nasdaq 100 index this year and market fears of an economic recession receding will embolden technology companies to follow Cisco's example and spend on big acquisitions.Story continues""I think the buyers' outlook on their own business has really improved from four months ago, and that gives confidence to pull the trigger on transformational transactions,"" Chen said in an interview.Jefferies analysts wrote in a note the Federal Reserve putting the brakes on interest rate hikes has given acquirers more certainty around their funding costs, helping dealmaking.Even before Cisco's deal, there were some signs that technology giants had started to eye acquisitions of software firms this year, albeit at a smaller scale. IBM, for example, agreed in June to buy technology spend-management platform Apptio for $4.6 billion.ATTRACTIVE VALUATIONSSplunk's stock performance made it receptive to a takeover. While its shares had risen 39% in 2023 prior to the deal's announcement, they were still down 44% from their October 2020 high, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced companies to spend more on information technology because most of their employees were working from home. Many of Splunk's peers have had similar stock performance.Software stocks are cheap by historical standards, making them attractive acquisition targets. The average software stock trades at 5.8 times projected 12-month revenue, 28% below its 8-year historical average when excluding the impact of COVID-19, which temporarily buoyed valuations in the sector, according to the Jefferies analysts.Cisco's deal valued Splunk at 7 times projected 12-month revenue, according to Jefferies. They and other analysts said the price Cisco was paying was reasonable.""We note that the typical security company with 20% growth trades at about 7 times (sales),"" BTIG analysts wrote in a note last week.Private software companies may also be more receptive to takeovers. Keith Skirbe, managing director in Houlihan Lokey's technology investment banking group, said that some companies that raised money at high valuations during the 2021 fundraising cycle prefer to be sold rather than be forced to raise money from their investors again at a lower valuation.""A tidal wave of software M&amp;A (is) on the horizon,"" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note last week.(Reporting by Milana Vinn in New York; Editing by Anirban Sen and Anna Driver)]"

A note from Jefferies analysts points to increased optimism for M&amp;A activity in the tech space, especially as AI becomes more prominent.Yahoo Finance Tech Reporter Allie Garfinkle details how AI hype is helping to drive up valuations of software developers while examining the outlook on renewed interests for tech M&amp;A.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Cisco closed its biggest ever deal last week buying Splunk for $28 billion. The acquisition creates one of the world's largest software companies and boosts Cisco's mission to access more recurring revenue. It's also clearly an AI play. The business has said artificial intelligence was central to the transaction. A new note from Jefferies says the deal could be a boon for more than just these two companies. Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's Allie Garfinkle. Allie, good to see you. So break this down for us.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Good morning, Rachelle. One thing that's important to know here right off the bat is this deal could absolutely provide a surge in tech M&amp;A. And it would be very welcome. We're coming off of years of this sort of macroeconomic-induced chill across dealmaking in tech, a sector that's really been famous for that.There are two reasons the Cisco-Splunk deal could really start moving things forward, I think. The first is that the world of buyers in software is actually doing really well on the public markets. 2022 was really difficult. But this year across software on average, valuations are up about 13% year-to-date.That means more optimism, more capital, more freedom to be looking for the kind of inorganic growth that a deal entails. Now, the second thing to consider here is the AI hype cycle itself. Yes, we've talked about it 1,000 times. But in the context of deal-making, you can't really overstate how important this kind of boon really is. Think about it, right?Story continuesDeals are narrative combined with data. An AI boom, the one we're in right now is about narrative combined with data. So there's this sort of convergence between these two things. And if you really believe that AI is going to kick off this investment cycle, you're also going to be wanting to do all sorts of deals to really meet that moment.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So Allie, how much can we really expect here?ALLIE GARFINKLE: It's a good question, Rachelle. I think you have to have somewhat tempered expectations. Remember this deal, the Splunk deal at almost $30 billion is a mega deal. It is huge, it is hard to get done, and there are only so many of those out there. That said, we are also coming off a really serious slowdown here.Global M&amp;A in the first half of 2023 was down 38%. That's according to Refinitiv data comparing this to the same period in 2022. And remember, the Cisco deal in some ways is unique, right? Cisco has been especially acquisitive. They've also done one of the other big deals we've seen this year, Armorblox.And I don't know if there's going to be a huge wave of deals exactly. I think we could definitely see some movement in the single digit billions. But it sounds like a pretty tall order to be getting movement going in the tens of billions at the scale that I think a lot of people would like to see and would be excited about.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Everyone waiting to see, will it lift all boats here? We'll have to certainly see if this could be the one that does it. Big thank you to our very own Allie Garfinkle.]"
