If you want to skip our introduction to the stock market and growth investing, then head on over to 5 Oversold Growth Stocks To Buy. Growth is one of the most popular words these days. Whether it's growth in the job market, growth in inflation, interest rates, or the economy, analysts and economists keenly reading any new data set to see what the tone will be for the stock market over the next couple of months.Right now, GDP growth is one of the hottest topics in the market, since this metric might be the one that ends up providing the Federal Reserve with more leeway in raising interest rates. Currently, interest rates in America are at multi-decade highs, and the central bank has started to slow down the pace recently as it evaluates whether the economy can withstand more pressure without contracting significantly and causing large losses. America's GDP grew by 2.4% in Q2 2023 which provided the Federal Reserve with some relief as it could take comfort in knowing that high interest rates have not been as damaging as initially feared. The strong GDP growth has also made big ticket banks, such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, revise their earlier estimates of a potential recession in America.Growth investing involves taking high risks with the hope of even higher rewards. As opposed to value investing, where the main goal of the investor is to gauge a differential between the implied and actual share price of a firm and take advantage if the former is higher, growth investing focuses on those companies whose shares are valued higher on the market than their book value might suggest. For the uninitiated, the book value of a stock is simply the firm's liabilities deducted from its assets and it is the value that the shareholders of a firm will receive in the unfortunate case of a liquidation. The book value is an important indicator in stock analysis as it provides an estimate of the true worth of an investment or a stock and therefore becomes a benchmark with which market prices are compared to determine under or overvaluation.Story continuesIn growth investing, the fundamental premise is that even though the book value of a company might be lower than its market price, over time it will grow due to strong market performance. Subsequently, it is not for the faint of heart and requires patience and holding the shares over a long time period to benefit from share price growth. Apart from the book value, another important financial ratio that is used to sift out growth stocks is the price to earnings ratio. While the book value, often converted into the price to book value per share, sees the current payout to a shareholder, the price to earnings ratio measures the valuation premium for a firm in the stock market compared to the money that it earns after expenses, taxes, and other obligations are deducted. The higher the P/E ratio is, the more the market expects the firm to grow its earnings in the future and this optimism is reflected in the share price.To pick out growth stocks, one can either use the P/E and P/B ratios to make the decisions or leave the stock picking to the professionals and use an exchange traded fund (ETF). An ETF is simply a collection of stocks that issues its own shares and is operated by a broker or another financial firm. There are dozens of ETFs for growth investing, and some with the lowest expense ratios are Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NASDAQ:VONG), iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:IMCG), Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:VOT), and iShares Morningstar Small-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:ISCG).Another way to pick out stocks, particularly if one cannot be bothered with analyzing a firm's fundamentals and its book value, is technical trading. Within this framework, one tool is called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This index measures the upward and downward movement in a share price over a time period (generally 14 days) and allows investors to determine if excessive market sentiment is driving the stock up or down. However, the utility of the RSI goes beyond this, since it can also be used to signal whether a bearish or bullish market is on the horizon. This is typically when the RSI fails to move in line with the share price and does not cross previous highs or lows. For instance, the share price might be going up but the RSI might fail to set new overbought levels, in what is generally thought to be a bearish indicator.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top oversold growth stocks to buy.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.48bUS$1.70bUS$1.79bUS$1.98bUS$2.11bUS$2.23bUS$2.33bUS$2.42bUS$2.50bUS$2.57bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 7.00%Est @ 5.53%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.79%Est @ 3.28%Est @ 2.93% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.1%) = US$49bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$49b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$38b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$79.6, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Edwards Lifesciences as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.899. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Edwards LifesciencesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. John Hall: Thank you operator. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along.Pixabay/Public Domain An appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information, which you should similarly review. As usual, after prepared remarks, we will host the Q&amp;A session, which will end promptly just prior to the top of the hour. In fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michelle. Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As market conditions continue to fluctuate, what has been a constant is the underlying performance of MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses. What has also been constant is the relentless execution of our strategy, which includes delivering in the second quarter on our commitment to accelerate the runoff of our legacy business through a financially attractive deal that also reduces enterprise risk. Our strong risk management capabilities are the bedrock of MetLife. This foundation enables us to successfully navigate shifting currents. We are confident in the prudence of our investment portfolio. We are secure in the effectiveness of our asset liability matching. We are certain of the safety and soundness of our capital and liquidity, and we are convinced of our balance sheet's strength. Shifting to second quarter results, last night we reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion, or $1.94 per share, which compares to $1.7 billion, or $2.13 per share a year ago. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum of our core businesses, which was evident in the quarter. Our sales were strong across the board with impressive results in group, retirement and income solutions, Asia and Latin America. Our underwriting results were well within targeted levels. Our direct expense ratio totaled 12.2%, illustrating our capacity to generate further operating leverage. Our recurring investment income continues to climb with new money rates pushing past 6%, and our adjusted return on equity of 14.6%, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, met our target range of 13% to 15%. For the quarter, variable investment income of $221 million came in below our outlook expectation. In the aggregate, private equity returns were about 1.5%, inclusive of a positive 40 basis point return on our venture capital portfolio. We generated a minus 1.9% return on real estate equity funds, an asset class that remains under some cyclical pressure. Nonetheless, we believe we've reached the trough relative to VIIs contribution to our quarterly adjusted earnings. In total, net income for the second quarter was $370 million, which reflects certain required accounting adjustments following the announcement of our pending re-insurance transaction with Global Atlantic. We did not incur material credit losses in our real estate portfolio or elsewhere during the second quarter. Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, I will start with our US group benefits results. Adjusted earnings totaled $372 million with underwriting results in line with our expectations after reflecting certain unfavorable items. In total, year-to-date sales are up 13% while year-to-date adjusted PFOs are up 5%, reflecting the impact of par firmly within our 4% to 6% outlook range, which we expect to achieve for the full year 2023. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to sustain our growth trajectory in this attractive capital-light business for many reasons. The strength of our relationships with our largest national accounts, where our average customer has been with us for more than 20 years, is well-known. The power behind this strength is apparent when you consider that 75% of new sales are made to existing customers through product additions and enrollment growth. Our efforts to accelerate growth in regional business is evident in our market share gains. A key element of this success is driven by our expansive product portfolio, the broadest across the benefits universe. As a proof point, more than half of our new regional business customers purchase multiple products. And again, this can also be seen in our success with voluntary products, which we've been able to grow at a mid-to-high-teens rate for many years now. For retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $417 million, up 11% from the prior year, driven by higher recurring investment margins and higher asset balances. Sales in the quarter were very strong across a range of products, including pension risk transfer with more than $2 billion booked, structured settlements, longevity reinsurance, and post-retirement benefits. We see good run rates for growth in all these areas. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $431 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income. Our ability to bring new products quickly to market was on full display in the quarter. Sales on a constant currency basis were up 34% in the region, led by Japan, where sales jumped 42% year-over-year, led by the introduction of a foreign currency life insurance product. Turning to Latin America, which put up another strong quarter, adjusted earnings totaled $219 million. Further, Latin America posted gains in both sales and adjusted PFOs of 13% and 14% respectively on a constant currency basis. Taking a wider lens on the momentum in our business, we managed through the pandemic expecting to emerge from the turmoil stronger than we entered. With the fullness of time, we can now see that is true. Some numbers can help. In full year 2019, our group benefits business generated premiums, fees, and other revenues of roughly $19 billion. We are on track to generate group benefits PFOs of roughly $24 billion in 2023, representing $5 billion of growth at a CAGR of more than 5%. In 2019, our retirement income solutions business generated average quarterly adjusted earnings of $310 million, with variable investment income matching outlook expectations. So far in 2023, RIS has averaged about $410 million of adjusted earnings per quarter, without the benefit of normal VII. Similarly, our Latin America business averaged roughly $150 million of adjusted earnings per quarter in 2019, which has grown to an average of more than $200 million per quarter in 2023. To me, the message is clear. The fundamentals associated with our market leading businesses continue to gather steam. Moving to capital and cash, MetLife remained active with capital management during the second quarter. Following the increase to our common stock dividend, we paid roughly $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders, and we repurchased $672 million of our common stock. The pace of repurchases in the second quarter slowed due to the impending announcement of our reinsurance deal. In addition to our activity in the second quarter, we repurchased roughly another $300 million of our common stock during the month of July. Here today through July, we have repurchased about $1.8 billion of our common shares, which leaves approximately $3.5 billion remaining on our expanded repurchase authorization. As we have done consistently over time, we carefully assess every use of capital with the goal of achieving the right balance between investing in responsible growth for the future and returning capital to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we held $4.2 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintained. In the beginning of July, we issued $1 billion of senior debt on attractive terms, which will be included in our cash balance in the third quarter. Beyond this, the dynamics of our reinsurance transaction will further add to cash as we move through the remainder of this year. During the quarter, we announced that Steve Goulart will retire at the end of August. Today will be his last earnings call with us. So feel free to pepper him with questions. You will not get another chance. I would like to take this moment to thank Steve for his 17 years of distinguished service to MetLife. In that time span, he led our corporate development and mergers and acquisitions team and served as treasurer before taking on his roles as MetLife's chief investment officer and the president of MetLife Investment Management. From a standing start in 2012, Steve established MetLife Investment Management and fostered its growth to its present status as a $167 billion institutional fixed income and real estate manager. I believe the talent at MetLife truly sets us apart and serves as a clear differentiator for our company. Steve's retirement provides the opportunity to broaden the roles and responsibilities of some of our top leaders. In addition to her role as chief risk officer, Marlene Debel will lead MetLife Insurance Investments with chief investment officer Chuck Scully reporting directly to Marlene. John McCallion, MetLife's chief financial officer will take on additional responsibility as the head of MetLife Investment Management. And Ramy Tadros, regional president to us business, will add head of MetLife Holdings to his portfolio. These moves draw upon MetLife's deep bench and illustrate our ability to deploy top talent to the areas of greatest impact for our customers and shareholders. In closing, MetLife's all weather strategy positions us to perform across a range of economic cycles. By focusing on what we can control, how we execute, how we invest, and how we deploy capital, we will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail. John McCallion: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '23 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital positions. In addition, I'll provide an update on our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Starting on Page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net investment losses were primarily the result of securities that were associated with the pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that we announced at the end of May. For GAAP purposes, gross unrealized losses as of June 30 on securities expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic at closing are required to be realized through net income this quarter. In addition, we had net derivative losses due to the favorable equity markets, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Yen, and higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were mostly offset this quarter by market risk benefit, or MRB remeasurement gains, due to higher equity markets and interest rates. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned, credit losses continue to be modest, and the hedging program performed as expected. On Page four, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding a favorable notable item of $77 million in 2Q of '22, primarily related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings. There were no notable items in the current quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion down 10%, and down 11% on a constant currency basis. The primary driver was lower variable investment income. Underwriting margins were also less favorable than the prior year, but within our targeted ranges. Higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.94 down 5% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses starting with the U.S., group benefits adjusted earnings were $372 million, down 8% versus the prior year period. Results were below run rate expectations for the quarter due to certain unfavorable expense, reinsurance, and reserve related items, which reduced group benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $40 million, and were specific to this quarter. The group-life mortality ratio was 85.3%, essentially in line with the prior year quarter, and at the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 73.7% in the quarter, above the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We had a disability reserve refinement of approximately $15 million after tax, which increased the ratio by 0.8 percentage points, and was included in the items totaling $40 million that I just referenced. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 4% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 1%, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year, primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum and voluntary, and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, group benefit sales were up 13% year-to-date, driven by strong growth across most products end markets. Retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $417 million, up 11% year-over-year. The primary drivers were higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth. This was partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 132 basis points. Spreads excluding VII were 142 basis points, up 29 basis points versus Q2 of '22, primarily due to higher interest rates, as well as income from in the money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were up 5% year-over-year, driven by general account liabilities, which grew 7% due to strong net flows. RIS adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers were up 73%, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we completed two transactions worth approximately $2 billion in the quarter, and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $431 million, down 11% and 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. Adjusted earnings ran approximately $25 million above expectation due to certain reserve refinements and tax related true ups. Asia's key growth metrics were strong as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth across the region. In Japan, sales were up 42% year-over-year, driven by continued strong momentum in FX annuities through our face-to-face channels, as well as life sales due to a relaunch of a single premium FX life product on April 1. We continue to see Japanese consumer interest for FX products given the attractive higher U.S. interest rates. Latin America adjusted earnings were $219 million, down 13% and 21% on a constant currency basis, due to less favorable underwriting margin versus 2Q of '22. The prior year quarter had a roughly $40 million benefit to adjusted earnings from a release of a COVID related IB&amp;R reserve. In addition, investment margins were down year-over-year, partially offset by solid volume growth. Latin America's top line continues to perform well, as adjusted PFOs were up 23% and 14% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 6% and up 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher recurring interest margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife holdings adjusted earnings were $211 million, down 31%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $228 million, essentially flat versus an adjusted loss of $227 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 22%, and at the low end of our 2023 guidance of 22% to 24%. On Page five, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $221 million in Q2 of ‘23. Private equity portfolio, $14.6 billion, had a plus 1.5% return in the quarter. Real estate equity funds of $2.2 billion had a minus 1.9% return, while both PE and real estate equity funds are reported on a one quarter lag. As of now, we anticipate that VII in the third quarter will generally be in line with the second quarter result. On Page six, we provide VII post tax by segment for the prior five quarters. As you've noted previously, each of the businesses holds its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match its liabilities. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RAS, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest portion of VII assets given their long dated liability profile. For 2Q of ‘23, Asia's VII portfolio generated the highest returns at 2.2%, outperforming MetLife Holdings at 1.5% and RAS at 0.9%. Now turning to Page seven, the chart on the left of the Page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years in Q2 of ‘22 versus Q2 of ‘23. While VII has had the lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring income, which accounts for approximately 96% of net investment income, was up $700 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the chart on the right of the Page, which shows our new money yield versus roll off yield over the past three years, new money yields continue to outpace roll off yields in the recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield reached its highest level in more than a decade of 6.06%, 157 basis points higher than the roll off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Turning to Page eight, I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans, which you can find further details in our quarterly financial supplement. As of June 30, our commercial mortgage loan, or CML portfolio, carrying value of approximately $53 billion is well diversified by geography and property type. The CML portfolio is concentrated in high quality properties and in larger primary markets. These loans are typically to the larger and stronger institutional sponsors who are better positioned to effectively manage assets through periods of stress. Given the focus on the office sector, our real estate team updated all U.S. office valuation through June 30, assuming a 25% peak to trough valuation decline. We believe it was prudent to focus our efforts here in the quarter given the heightened attention this has received. As expected, LTVs increased slightly as a result with our CML portfolio now in an average LTV of 62%, up from 58% in the first quarter of ‘23, and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.3 times down slightly from 2.4 times in 1Q ‘23. The modest increase in LTVs coupled with the resiliency and robustness of the debt service coverage ratio is another indicator of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2% of the loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we now have successfully resolved 69% of the portfolio's schedule to mature in 2023, and our expectation is for minimal losses on the portfolio. Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 9. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for full year 2022, as well as Q1 of '23 and Q2 of '23, which had a ratio of 12.2%. As you have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q2 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top-line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio of 12.6% or below in 2023, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at June 30, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to $4 billion and consistent with March 31. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and share repurchases of roughly $700 million in the second quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. The buybacks in Q2 of '23 were lower than our recent trend as we were in a blackout period for most of May in advance of our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. That said, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $300 million in July. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter, year-to-date 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2 billion, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion, statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.4 billion as of June 30, 2023, down 2% from March 31, 2023, primarily due to the temporary impact of roughly $300 million associated with the investments expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic. We expect these impacts to reverse at close, which remains on target by year-end. In addition, as previously disclosed, we expect the transaction to add approximately 60 combined RBC points. Finally, we expect the Japan-Solvency Margin Ratio to be approximately 700% as of June 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Let me conclude with a few points. First, while VII remains below historical returns, we believe we reached a trough. In addition, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from a higher yielding environment. Second, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals continues to be displayed with strong top-line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. Lastly, MetLife remains in a position of strength, given our balance sheet, investment portfolio, free cash flow generation, and the diversification of our market-leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we first go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead. See also 20 Most Educated States in America and 10 Recent IPOs in 2023 to Consider.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionRyan Krueger: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was, following the recent risk transfer deal, do you see further opportunities for additional risk transfer in MetLife holdings over time? John McCallion: Good morning, Ryan. It's John. I think we would probably follow the same commentary we've given before. We are continuing to look for ways to optimize. We look internally for ways to optimize, and we continue to have external communications around different opportunities. I think at the end of the day, similar to what we did with this transaction, it needs to fit the right profile for us. It needs to be value-creative. It needs to be risk-reducing. And by the end of the day, we don't have to. We're very comfortable managing these blocks of businesses ourselves. We have the expertise. And I think there are different ways to find ways to optimize that book. But nonetheless, it's a healthy process for us continuing to have these conversations. Ryan Krueger: Thanks. And then I had to ask one for Steve on his last call. Could you provide some additional details on the office loans that have been resolved year-to-date, the mix of paydowns versus extensions and any more color on what the terms of the extensions are? Steven Goulart: Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. I would hate to go through my last earnings call without a question. But on your question, let me talk about the total portfolio. Again, John mentioned 69% of the loans scheduled to mature this year have already been resolved. Of that, 31% of them were actually paid off. So very positive. And 57% of them were resolved through the borrower extension of contractual loan extensions. And we've talked about that a little bit in the past. But again, those are not financially distressed loans. I mean, the average LTV on those loans is 51%. And again, they have contractual extensions that allow the borrower to choose to extend. And that's what has happened with those. And again, when they do, they have to meet financial performance tests related to debt yield, related to LTV, sometimes both. We also get fees paid on those extensions. And so it's not a surprise, it's given where interest rates are, that this is what the borrowers would choose to do. The office portfolio is very similar in those statistics that I just gave. So we're very comfortable looking out the rest of the year. We would expect similar resolutions and are very pleased with how it's moving forward. Ryan Krueger: Okay, great. Thank you Steve. Operator: And our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, John, I think you pointed out that there was around 40 million of one-off items within groups. So just thinking about going forward, should we just normalize for that and think about that as the run-rate earnings power of the segment? Or is there any other seasonality that we should take in mind in the back half of the year? Ramy Tadros: Hi, Elyse. It's Ramy. So the short answer to your question is yes. So these were unfavorable items that we don't expect to reoccur. Just to give you a flavor of what the items were. So the first one is an expense item which is related to a catch-up on state tax assessment. The second one is an adjustment on the life-free insurance policy. And the third one is a reserve refinement in our disability line which as John indicated impacted our non-medical health ratio by just about a point. So we don't expect these to be recurring as I mentioned. And so, you could essentially normalize for those on a go-forward basis. Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, you guys saw buyback pick up in July. So is that July level kind of a good run rate from here? As we think about the holding transaction closing and then I also believe, your subsidiary dividends are typically, greater in the back half of the year? Michel Khalaf: Hi. Good morning, Elyse. Michelle here. So I would say that there was a bit of catch-up in July given the fact that we were in blackout for, part of the second quarter due to the re-insurance transaction. So, if you look at probably the sort of run rate up to July here to date, I think that gives you a good sense of sort of pacing. We obviously we're looking to close the transaction in the second half of the year. And one we do, we'll assess the environment at the time. I think we've built a good track record here in terms of, after major divestitures in terms of how we we're deliberate and expeditious and returning access capital and, expect the same here. Elyse Greenspan: Thanks, Michelle. Operator: And next we go to Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.Erik Bass: Hi, thank you. Can you provide some more color on your non-medical health underwriting results this quarter, in particular, the experience in dental and disability and how you're thinking about those going forward? Ramy Tadros: Sure, Erik. It's Ramy here. So, I'll start with disability. So, all results this quarter were favorable year-over-year. We're seeing favorable incidents and very strong recovery levels and I'm very pleased with the performance of that line this quarter. And as I just noted before, we have seen about a one-point impact on the ratio given some of those reserve refinements which we referred to earlier. On disability, we're continuing to benefit from tailwinds here in terms of favorable macroenvironment and interest rates and tight labor markets. But aside from the macro factors, we're also benefiting from our strong underwriting, our return to health capabilities, the deployment of data and technology and how we run this business. And we also continue to invest in our leave and absence capabilities which give us pricing power and continue to resonate well in the marketplace. From a dental perspective, we have seen a slight elevation, our trend this quarter, driven by an increase in our claims costs. As part of the normal course of managing this product, we adjust our pricing to make sure we meet our target margins. So as a reminder, we reprice the majority of our dental book, call it about 80% annually and we're always monitoring the trend and adjusting our pricing accordingly. So this is part of the course in terms of managing a dental book. And maybe if you want to kind of step back and look at the non-medical health benefit ratio for the full year which is inclusive of dental and disability, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year here. Erik Bass: Thank you. And then if it could pivot to Asia, Japan sales continue to be very strong. So we could talk a little bit more about what's driving this, the current competitive dynamics in the market and what impact a change in BOJ policy could have on the business. Lyndon Oliver: Hey, yes, thanks Erik. It's Lyndon here. So look, we're very pleased with the overall sales performance we've seen in Asia in the second quarter. You've seen Asia's sales overall have grown 34%. And Japan in particular is up 42% and the rest of Asia up 17%. Now if we look a little deeper in Japan, foreign currency products continue to drive our sales growth over there. The market for single premium foreign currency products has been strong given the higher rate environment. And we continue to sustain our market position in the annuity segment. Michele pointed out in his opening remarks, our ability to bring new products to market quickly has really helped us in terms of launching our single premium foreign currency product. We've also optimized our capital structure for these products by leveraging our internal reinsurance in Bermuda. So the combination of both the product differentiation, the speed to market, as well as the strength of our distribution in the face to face as well as bank assurance has really been a strong factor in growing sales. If we look the rest of Asia, we've recovered really well this year. We've seen broad based improvement in China, India and Korea. And overall, all the initiatives we've taken on the customer side, the distribution side, as well as on the product, the new product launches have really helped in these markets. And if we look ahead to the outlook, our management actions have really continued to drive the sales momentum. But when we look at the year over year comparison for the second half, we're going to be challenged given we had a strong second half of the year last year. However, we're on track to be at the high end of the full year guidance of mid to high single digits. Erik Bass: Thank you. Operator: Next, we move to a question from Jamminder Bhullar with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jamminder Bhullar: Good morning. So first, just a question on threads in the retirement business. Assuming that interest rates sort of followed the forward yield curve, it would be reasonable that your yield would pick up, but should we assume that spreads would improve as well? Or are you at a point where now any incremental increases in yield in the retirement business would need to be passed through to customers through higher productivity? John McCallion: Hey, Jimmy, it's John. Good morning. Look, as we think about yield, as you said, we had a really strong quarter and certainly an RIS. We were 132 all in. And if you exclude VI, we're a healthy 142. And probably if you kind of normalize for VII, that puts us at the high end of the range, it's very much in line with what we gave at our outlook. We thought the first half of the year, even though the Ford curves have moved around and things like that, that we would have kind of a higher level in Q1 and Q2. I think as you look forward, we would think spreads kind of hover around this point. I'm not so sure it would kind of -- now, why it does that is not necessarily exactly, I'd say, perfectly aligned with the pass-through comment you made.I think there's a variety of other factors. I think it's just as the curve begins to shift, how the impact of the caps versus the long end start to manifest itself in spreads. But I think right now we would view the kind of the third quarter outlook would be somewhere in this vicinity or maybe the average of Q1 and Q2. Michel Khalaf: And my comment was around this competition as well because there's a limit, obviously, to how much they can reasonably improve. Jamminder Bhullar: Yes, what I meant was if the rates keep going up, you're already at a pretty good point in terms of spread. So I'm assuming it's unreasonable to assume that they keep improving a lot more from here. John McCallion: Yes, that's fair. I think the key for us is, I'd say to your point, new business pricing is, that's where I think your point lies. I think, we still are on an overall basis have some -- we're short. So I think as there's roll-off reinvest, that's where my point was. Jamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then in Japan, you've been selling a lot of 4x products some of your peers have as well. And I think with changes in the economic solvency margin, that product becomes more sort of capital unfriendly or not as friendly as it is right now. So I'm wondering if you are planning on making any changes to your products or you could actually manage around that through offshore reinsurance. And then relatedly, I don't know if there's a limit to how much the FSA would let companies use in terms of or use offshore reinsurance to shift business out of Japan. Lyndon Oliver: Yes, look, hey, it's Lyndon here. Let me make a couple of comments around this. So the ESR implementation is a couple of years away. And we continue to make very good progress looking at all these products under the new regime. But we're still early in the work and the regulations are still evolving. The second point here is we currently price our products on the MetLife's economic solvency and on a local statutory basis. So to some extent, we're already using an economic lens as we analyze product profitability. But as I said, it's a little early regulations continue to go to evolve. We're in the middle of field testing. So I think as our implementation plan progresses, we will start to make adjustments as needed. This would include reinsurance or product modifications or anything like that. But it would still be too early given it's a couple of years away. Jamminder Bhullar: Thank you. Operator: And our next question is from Thomas Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thomas Gallagher: Good morning. First one is just on a trend, peers have seen which has been elevated long-term care claims. It looked to me like holdings, underwriting and underlying earnings were actually pretty favorable. So I wanted to see if you also experienced elevated long-term care claims within that and if so, how much? John McCallion: Thanks. Good morning, Tom. It's John. We did see some unfavorability kind of towards the end of Q1 and into Q2 and maybe the first couple months of Q2 higher claims as well as some lower terminations on just on a relative trend perspective. Towards the end of Q1 or Q2, I should say, and then into July, we've seen those trends revert back. So right now, we probably would account for that as an aberration, a short-term aberration, but we'll obviously still monitor I think just an overall point around results for holding. While that's the case, we had favorable mortality in the segment. So that was a positive, but specifically the long-term care. That's the case. I think on the flip side, the team has been doing a really, really good job continuing to get rate increases. We've already met our typical run rate of rate increases this year at 4.5% of premium year-to-date. That's what we typically assume each year. So we're off to a great start there. Thomas Gallagher: Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, so last quarter, I think you all had mentioned 200 million of potential foreclosures on CRE or CMLs with 15 million of related losses, as I guess that was a stress test. What would the update be now? It sounds like it's probably going to be less than that, but curious what you think now. And then also, have you seen any meaningful credit migration into 2Q on your CNBS portfolio? Thanks. Steven Goulart: Hey, Tom. It's Steven Goulart. Thanks for the question. And I think you were headed in the right direction basically. Obviously, we continue to do stress testing, but really nothing to note on that. We're very comfortable with the portfolio, very comfortable with the results of the stress testing. Certainly nothing's different. Anything may be marginally better than last time. You talked about foreclosures also. We did use a number. Frankly, it's going to come in materially less than that. We think we're going to have very small charge-offs in the portfolio as well. The portfolio is very well positioned. So I think we're very comfortable with it. And it will continue to perform through this. I'm sorry. The last part of the question was related to CNBS migration. Can you repeat the last question?Thomas Gallagher: Sure. Steve, CNBS, did you see credit migration on that portfolio, downgrades, or did you have losses on that portfolio that you took this quarter? Steven Goulart: No. We haven't had any material losses in that portfolio. Michel Khalaf: I'll just add two things, Tom. So I think to Steve's point around just losses, I think his reference to just materially less was relative to the stress that we had put out. The comments I made in the first quarter around what our expectations for kind of the maturities and kind of the potential loss there, I'd say no change is one. And then two, just maybe broadly speaking around just credit losses were very modest this quarter, as we said. And actually, I don't know if we even had any in real estate and CECL went down because there was a revaluation of a hotel that actually went up. So there's a lot of factors there. But I think all in all, the portfolio is performing well. Thomas Gallagher: Thanks, guys. Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Suneet Kamath from Jeffries. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Just start out the best of luck to Steve. Just on the 69% of CML maturities that were, I guess, resolved here. I don't know if you mentioned this, but what percentage of those were office, if you can disclose that? John McCallion: Yes. Let's see. The resolution was basically in line with the overall portfolio. And of the office loans, roughly the same percentage were resolved. Trying to get the actual percentage of the office. I'll get that in one second for you. Suneet Kamath: Okay. I can give it to my second question and then maybe circle back. I guess, for Ramy, we've seen good disability results sort of across the board, I guess, for a couple quarters now. Just curious, based on your experience, when do you think that some of these results might start to feather into pricing and we could start to see greater competition? I would imagine at some point, it would need to work its way through. Just wondering any thoughts on the timing of that. Thanks. Ramy Tadros: Sure. I mean, I think if you're thinking about this over kind of the short to medium term, and I would say that like four factors, driving disability margins, you've got very disciplined underwriting, you've got strong claim management, you've got customer service that drives persistency and the ability to get appropriate rates at renewal. And this one is particularly important if you're in the business of providing bundled solutions, including absence and leave capabilities, which we are a market leader in. And then, of course, you got the macro factors in terms of the employment levels as well as the competitive environment. I would say for us, the first three drivers of this underwriting claims and capabilities are a core competitive advantage and will continue to be so as we continue to invest in this business. If you think about the macro environment, we're seeing some of those tailwinds right now, but we continue to be disciplined in our pricing because there's a fair bit of uncertainty in the environment going forward. And we're certainly continuing to bake that into our pricing as we look into '24. Suneet Kamath: So pretty rational environment in terms of pricing, not just you guys, but just in terms of what you're seeing from a competitive perspective? Ramy Tadros: Yes, I would say it's competitive. It's rational. And there's also multiple levers to differentiate beyond price. And we're certainly pulling on every single one of those levers given our scale and capabilities in this business. Steven Goulart: Hey, Suneet, this is Steve too. And I just wanted to follow up. We did, sorry, I didn't have that answer at the tip of my fingers. But basically, it's just over five billion of total resolutions. And of that, nearly half were office. Suneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator: And our next question is from Michael Ward with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe just on VII or [also] overall, pretty solid result, I think, considering the macro and real estate dynamic. Just wondering if you can expand on your competence in that trough, the trough dynamic, thinking about the real estate equity, or I guess overall non-cash sort of gains, just hoping you can expand on that competence. John McCallion: Hey, good morning, Mike. It's John. Yes, I think, as both Michelle and I mentioned in our opening remarks, our view is, yes, we've come to a trough. I think, different assets are in kind of different positions. But all in all, in the trough, we've seen some headwinds in real estate, the funds that I mentioned, minus 1.9, but we saw some positive offsets in the PE portfolio. We think that dynamic continues into the next quarter, which is why I mentioned we would generally be in line with now. Obviously it's early. We don't have a ton of, I'll say, objective insight. We have some qualitative commentary and views. We've seen a positive, equity markets, although might be driven by a small number of stocks, depending on how you look at the second quarter. So, but, and that typically directionally translates into some level of, I'll say, the positive in line return, but the betas are typically lower. So that's kind of where we are. We kind of view this trough as more of a U-shaped recovery in this asset class versus kind of a sharp V. But, and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. So right now we're, we kind of view that the best view would be kind of in line with Q2. Michael Ward: Thanks, John. And then maybe for just career benefits overall in the U.S., just curious from your guys' perspective about the climate or the sentiment for U.S. employers, labor market's been pretty resilient. Some headlines around headcount reductions. Just curious what you guys are hearing in that regard and also on wages or, and how that flows into demand for overall benefits. Thanks.Michel Khalaf: Thanks. I would say from a top line perspective, we're still seeing significant strength across the portfolio. So we're very pleased with our PFO growth. And that's a combination of new customers. It's a combination of good persistency, rate actions for a portion of our portfolio. We've got some tailwinds in terms of wage growth. So we're still seeing very strong momentum there. As Michelle alluded to, we're still seeing double digit growth in our voluntary portfolio. And with a lot of white space, both in terms of customers who don't offer voluntary as well as increasing opportunities to increase penetration within the work site as well. And then I would also just point to the below 5,000 space, which we define as our regional market. National is above 5,000. That is emerging as a particularly bright spot for us. Our PFO growth there is high single digits. We do a fair bit of internal research where we cut the data by market segment. And when you look at that data below 5,000, we're a top three player in that segment, and we're continuing to take share in the fragmented market. So all in all, we're still seeing really positive tailwinds both from the macro environment as well as how we're positioned in this business that's driving PFO growth. That's kind of well within the 4% to 6% range that we have. Michael Ward: Thanks, guys. Operator: And next we go to a question from Alexander Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Scott: Hi. First one is a little bit of a housekeeping question. I was just interested in the corporate expense load. It looks a little bit elevated. I know some of that. I know some of that is just part of VII, but even other expenses a bit elevated. So I just wanted to get a feel for if there's anything nuanced going on there in the investment in the business or something we need to be aware of and just confidence around the 650 to 750 annualized number heading in the back half and into next year. John McCallion: Good morning, Alex. It's John. As you point out a couple things. One, obviously, VII being below the kind of historical returns puts pressure on C&amp;O as well. So that's probably one driver to maybe the elevated loss that you're referencing. We did have higher expenses in C&amp;O. Obviously, our direct expense ratio came in well. Overall expenses would were very good along with strong top line growth. So our ratio at 12.2 was well below the 12.6. We're still obviously targeting below the 12.6 for full year and it can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but a good quarter nonetheless. In terms of the expenses, if you kind of compare to last year, I'd say probably two main things to highlight. One, interest on debt. It was one item year-over-year. That's a relatively big piece of that. And then the second one is we did have some higher one-time costs in C&amp;O this quarter due to some corporate initiatives. I'll call it that, it was part of just kind of our general efficiency mindset. We don't ever exclude those things. Those are all part of our direct expense ratio, but their investments that we've made to kind of improve our run rate go forward. So hopefully that helps with C&amp;O. Alexander Scott: Yes, that is helpful. The second one I had for you is just on the pitch downgrade of U.S. debt. I think having two out of three below AAA now probably moves the you know, the composite rating and so maybe that would affect risk rates and yes, it seems like it should be reasonably limited, but just wanted to get your thoughts on, we should expect any material impact RBC from that and, if it affects anything else in your business? John McCallion: Hey Alex, it's John. Obviously, very recent news. I'm not so sure I saw a ton of reaction yesterday on it and nor do we really think that it has a broad-based impact on, how we run our business or we wouldn't expect capital impacts, but I guess you never know, but right now, we wouldn't expect any impact one way or the other in terms of our, how we run our investment portfolio and our outlooks there. It doesn't change anything. Alexander Scott: Got it. Thank you. Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, for final remarks, I'd like to turn the call back to MetLife's Global Head of Investor Relations, John Hall. John Hall: Well, thank you everybody for joining us and you know where to find us with any follow-up questions. Thanks very much and have a good day. Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T teleconference. You may now disconnect.]"

""At present, however, there are actually some positive signals with regard to the energy sector.""For example Mexico last fall announced it was increasing the degree of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the government has announced some specific actions toward improving conditions. According to the World Bank flaring volume in Mexico fell significantly in 2022, reversing a trend of rising that had been seen for several years. Total CO2 emissions are also down, according to information compiled by the International Energy Agency.""Perryman said renewable generation capacity in Mexico is growing and the government plans further increases.""At the same time coal consumption is falling,"" he said. ""Oil and natural gas production in Mexico peaked more than a decade ago and the geology there is not as favorable for recovering shale gas as it is in many other areas. In fact U.S. exports of natural gas to Mexico have increased by more than 400 percent since 2011.""The economist said private investment in Mexico's energy exploration and production is small but growing and total foreign direct investment in Mexico is up significantly.""Nonetheless the combination of relatively high political risk, the relatively high carbon content of the Mayan crude that is predominant in Mexico and overall uncertainty in the energy sector make sizable international investment unlikely,"" he said. ""In short Mexico faces significant and ongoing challenges, but some of the extreme chatter about the current problems appears to overstate matters based on a review of objective international data.""Story continuesRobertson said President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's actions to nationalize energy production in Mexico, such as the nation's $6-billion purchase of natural gas plants and a wind farm from Spain's biggest power company, Iberdrola Energy, earlier this year, ""could have a chilling effect on international investment in energy production in the country.""Imports in energy from Texas continue to rise,"" Robertson said. ""Mexico is still Texas' No. 1 trading partner and oil and natural gas continue at the top of the export list from Texas to Mexico. In fact in 2022 Texas exported more oil and natural gas in value to Mexico than in any previous year according to data promulgated by the U.S. Census Bureau.""With the Permian Basin now accounting for over 40 percent of the U.S.'s total crude oil production and around 20 percent of the total domestic natural gas production, Robertson said, a large portion of those exports will originate from wells in the Basin.]"

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Monster Beverage's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Monster Beverage How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Monster Beverage is:18% = US$1.4b ÷ US$7.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.18 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Monster Beverage's Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo start with, Monster Beverage's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 17%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 7.1% seen over the past five years by Monster Beverage.As a next step, we compared Monster Beverage's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 4.2%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is MNST worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MNST is currently mispriced by the market.Is Monster Beverage Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Given that Monster Beverage doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Monster Beverage's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

The dividend yield will be 7.9% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Western Union Western Union's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. The last payment was quite easily covered by earnings, but it made up 108% of cash flows. While the company may be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business at this time, we think that a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 10.4% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 56%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendWestern Union Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.40 total annually to $0.94. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.9% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that Western Union has been growing its earnings per share at 15% a year over the past five years. While on an earnings basis, this company looks appealing as an income stock, the cash payout ratio still makes us cautious.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Western Union's DividendOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Just as an example, we've come across 4 warning signs for Western Union you should be aware of, and 3 of them can't be ignored. Is Western Union not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

If you want to skip the global immigration landscape, go straight to 10 Countries with the Highest Proportion of Immigrants.As immigration implicates workforce dynamics and human capital value, it enables the host countries to diversify their potential. Canada, for instance, has an economic immigration system of Express Entry that specifically attracts skilled immigrants. Eventually, the deliberate capitalization of immigrants' human capital supports Canada's financial growth strategy. Similarly, in the US, high-skilled immigrants, particularly those in STEM fields, have been central to innovation and entrepreneurship. We have covered 20 Most Immigrant Friendly Countries In The World according to the number of immigrants they currently host and their percentages of migrant stock; give it a read to know which countries are the most accepting of incoming settlers. Inclusion Of Immigrants in the Workforce30.1% of Australia's population is foreign-born, of which, a two thirds are now residents, owing to the country's market-driven immigration policy. As Australia has family reunification, tertiary education, and investment policies for foreign-born people, the country has attracted high-skilled workers from across the globe. As a result of its inclusive education policy, 55% of adult immigrants in Australia have tertiary education. When it comes to the US, a National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) report states that immigrants founded 55% (or 319 of 582) of the US billion-dollar startups. In comparison, 64% of billion-dollar companies in the country have first or second-generation immigrant founders. Likewise, according to the American Immigration Council, immigrants or their children have founded 43.8% of Fortune 500 companies in the country. The strategic value of immigrants extends to generating jobs, advancing technology, and contributing significantly to the GDP.Story continuesNotably, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries rely on temporary migration to meet their labor needs. As evidenced by huge percentages of foreign-born people in Qatar, Kuwait, and UAE, millions of immigrant workers are employed in construction, engineering, and almost every other low-medium income and high-skilled occupation. Even though the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) receives significantly larger numbers of low-skilled workers than other high-income countries, these immigrants don't have citizenship rights. There has also been criticism of workers' poor treatment in the Gulf. According to the World Bank's report, about two-thirds of the labor in Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, while 80–90% in Qatar, Kuwait, and UAE are temporary migrants. Their stay in the host countries can range from months to several decades.Immigration's impact on business isn't merely economic; it also has social implications. Increased cultural diversity within workforces can foster innovation, but it also requires strategies for integration and cultural sensitivity. Moreover, businesses must navigate regulatory frameworks, which differ significantly across nations. For instance, US companies face challenges related to the H-1B visa cap, which limits the number of foreign workers they can employ annually. Australian businesses, however, operate under a points-based immigration system that prioritizes skills and benefits businesses that require a highly skilled workforce. Global immigration patterns further create a transnational economic impact. Remittances, or the funds that immigrants send back to their home countries, are a significant source of external finance for developing countries. According to the World Economic Forum, global remittances reached $794 billion in 2022, up from $128 billion in 2000. The central recipient countries for international remittances are India, China, Mexico, the Philippines, and Egypt, while the US, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and Germany are the main remittance senders, as per the World Migration Report 2022. Factors like the inclusion of immigrants in the workforce and the potential for skilled workers make countries the best for settling. Know more about which nations are winning in these aspects by reading 30 Best Countries in the World.Companies Making Immigrants' Lives EasierSending remittances to home countries used to be a big challenge for immigrants before companies like Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) made international transactions easier. The World Bank has acknowledged the role of The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) in facilitating financial inclusion and economic development in low-income countries by providing accessible remittance channels. The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) 's support for immigrants is evident by its $15M commitment to Opportunity Beyond Borders, a 3-year initiative that aims to help obstacles faced by migrant and refugee youth. Likewise, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) 's subsidiary, Google, provides services that ease immigrants' lives. For instance, Google Translate by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) aids in overcoming language barriers, and Google Maps assists in navigating new cities. More importantly, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has partnered with Coursera to provide learning resources to immigrants that can help them upskill and adapt to the workforces in the countries they move to. In addition, Google.org (Google's philanthropic arm) has donated to organizations like the International Rescue Committee to help refugees and immigrants.Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has partnered with IOM, the UN Migration Agency, to provide financial education to immigrants so they can bypass non-recorded payment routes. Also, after recognizing the need for transparent and secure delivery of humanitarian aid, Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has developed the Mastercard Aid Network. This award-winning, non-monetary technology platform delivers secure resources to people in need. In the broad spectrum, aid can help immigrants and refugees access immediate needs upon arriving in a new country.Let's now find countries with the highest proportions of immigrants. 25 Countries with the Highest Proportion of Immigrants25 Countries with the Highest Proportion of ImmigrantsOur Methodology We ranked countries with the highest proportion of immigrants based on the percentage share of immigrants relative to the respective countries' populations. Our primary source for the proportions of immigrants was the Migration Data Portal which displays the number of immigrants and the population percentage these immigrants make in all countries. Other sources to understand global immigration trends and their impact on economies were The World Bank's Migrants, Refugees, and Societies Report 2022, the World Migration Report 2022, and Knomad Database by the World Bank. Note: While there are subtle differences between immigrants and migrants, for the purpose of this study, we have treated them as the same.Based on our findings, here are the countries with the highest proportion of immigrants:25 countries with the highest proportion of immigrants25. United StatesPercentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 15.3%It's ironic how the country with the largest number of immigrants ranks last among the countries with the highest proportion of immigrants. The number of immigrants in the United States is currently standing at 50.6 million, according to the migration data portal. If we talk about percentages, 15.3% people of the country's current populace of 331 million are foreign-born. Being the largest economy in the world with a current GDP of $25.5 trillion, the US offers work opportunities for incoming settlers along with a benefiting social welfare system. Notably, US natives are getting increasingly unhappy regarding immigrants, as evidenced by a Gallup Poll that shared how 40% of Americans in 2023 want the country's immigrant population to decrease. 24. Norway Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 15.7%In Norway, immigration has become a significant part of demographic growth, and over 15.7% of the total population is foreign-born. Most of these people settle in Norway from Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden. While the country generally offers a high standard of living, there has been debate over integrating immigrants, especially non-European ones. The government has implemented stricter immigration policies over recent years, which makes settling here a long process. 23. Cyprus Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 15.8%Cyprus has a long history of immigration due to its strategic location; the country attracts immigrants from Greece, the UK, and Russia. The immigration process can be complex due to the country's divided status and political challenges. Cyprus' stance towards immigrants can vary based on origin and political considerations, but it is generally seen as moderately accepting. Still, issues such as a strained asylum system have been pressing concerns.22. Belgium Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 17.3%Belgium's central European location makes it a big receiver of international immigrants from other EU countries like Italy, France, Romania, Morocco, and Turkey. Nearly 17.3% of the country's population is foreign-born, owing to its well-established integration policy that provides language and civic courses. However, there are challenges regarding societal integration and labor market accessibility. Public opinion on immigration is mixed, with right-wing parties advocating for more restrictive policies.21. Ireland Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 17.6%Ireland has transformed from an emigrant to an immigrant society and now accepts immigrants from Poland, the UK, and other nations who make up around 17.6% of the total population. The government generally adopts a positive stance towards immigration and views foreign-born people as a means to combat demographic challenges and fill labor shortages. Nevertheless, long waiting times for asylum application processing have sparked criticism and calls for reform.20. Austria Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 18%Austria has a mixed attitude towards immigrants that fluctuates in line with its changing political landscape. For instance, the Austrian People's Party is known for its conservative stance and has often stressed the need for regulated immigration. Nevertheless, immigrants comprise nearly 18% of the population, with a significant portion from former Yugoslavia and Turkey. 19. Germany Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 18.8%Germany is one of the countries with the highest ratio of immigrants. It hosts the 2nd highest number of immigrants that make up the country's 18.8% population as of current. The country's aging population and declining birth rates have encouraged policymakers to accept immigrants as a solution to labor shortages. In 2015, during the refugee crisis, Germany showed exceptional openness by accepting over one million asylum seekers. However, these policies have been met with xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments.18. Iceland Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 19.2%Iceland has a growing immigrant population, accounting for about 19.2% of the total populace, as it has been proactive in accepting refugees. The country has also been encouraging immigration to offset the nation's low birth rate and sustain its strong economic growth. Icelandic society generally shows positive attitudes towards immigrants, and the government has implemented various measures to facilitate their integration, including free language courses and the Multicultural and Information Centre that aims to enhance understanding between Icelanders and immigrant communities.17. Sweden Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 19.8%Sweden is one of the countries with highest proportion of immigrants. It has a multicultural society where 19.8% of the population is born abroad. But notably, the country's generous asylum policies have been tested, particularly following the 2015 refugee crisis. After the huge influx of refugees approached Sweden, along with other countries, tensions surfaced regarding issues of integration and identity. The country accepted approximately 160,000 refugees in 2015 from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. But after that, the Swiss government responded with more restrictive immigration policies and increased focus on integration measures.16. CanadaPercentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 21.3%Canada has inclusive immigration policies, and upwards of 300,000 new immigrants enter the country annually. These policies reflect Canada's commitment to multiculturalism, as immigrants are seen as catalysts for innovation and population growth. Immigrants often receive substantial government support, including language education and job-search assistance. Most Canadian immigrants are from India, China, and Afghanistan. 15. Israel Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 22.6%As Israel is the homeland of the Jewish diaspora, it has a unique approach to immigration, with its Law of Return offering Jewish individuals automatic citizenship. The country saw large influxes of immigrants, particularly from Russia and Ethiopia, in the 1980s and 1990s. However, non-Jewish immigration is highly restricted and often contentious, as seen with African asylum seekers.14. Lebanon Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 25.1%Given its economic condition, Lebanon is surely an unusual name amongst the most welcoming countries for immigrants. As per Human Rights Watch, over 50% population of Lebanon lives under the poverty line, and the majority finds it difficult to make ends meet. But despite the challenges, the country has a massive influx of immigrants, mainly refugees from neighboring countries, that make up 25.1% of the country's current population. Lebanon hosts the highest number of refugees per capita in the world, primarily Syrians and Palestinians, which eventually result in a high foreign-born population. 13. New Zealand Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 28.7%New Zealand is among the best countries in the world according to immigrants, owing to its high employment rate of foreign-born people and attractiveness for skilled workers. As of current, 28.7% of New Zealand's population is born overseas, which reflects the country's welcoming stance. New Zealand has a point-based immigration system that prioritizes skilled migrants. A survey by the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment found that 54% of New Zealanders feel that immigrants make their country a better place, so incoming settlers often experience a welcoming environment in NZ. 12. Switzerland Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 28.8%Switzerland, though small, is a desirable destination for immigrants from EU/EFTA countries due to its strong economy. Immigrants make up about 28.8% of Switzerland's population. Notably, Swiss immigration policy is regulated by bilateral agreements with the EU and prioritizes skilled immigrants. Despite high immigrant numbers, some immigrants face discrimination and socio-economic disparities.11. Australia Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 30.1%Australia ranks 11th among countries with the highest proportion of migrants. It has a multicultural society, with immigrants making up nearly 30.1% of its population. The country also follows a points-based system that emphasizes skilled migrants, particularly those who will contribute to the nation's economic growth. While acceptance can vary depending on the political climate, generally, Australia has a favourable view of immigration. However, the country's offshore processing and detention of asylum seekers has drawn international criticism.Click to continue reading 10 Countries with the Highest Proportion of Immigrants.Suggested Articles15 States with the Highest Percentage of Illegal Immigrants25 Best Countries for Wealthy People to Move To25 Most Unfriendly Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 25 Countries with the Highest Proportion of Immigrants is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

Check out our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Based on the last payment, Amgen was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 5.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 60%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendAmgen Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.44, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $8.52. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 19% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Amgen has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 35% per annum. Amgen is clearly able to grow rapidly while still returning cash to shareholders, positioning it to become a strong dividend payer in the future.We Really Like Amgen's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow.

If you want to skip the global immigration landscape, go straight to 10 Countries with the Highest Proportion of Immigrants.As immigration implicates workforce dynamics and human capital value, it enables the host countries to diversify their potential. Canada, for instance, has an economic immigration system of Express Entry that specifically attracts skilled immigrants. Eventually, the deliberate capitalization of immigrants' human capital supports Canada's financial growth strategy. Similarly, in the US, high-skilled immigrants, particularly those in STEM fields, have been central to innovation and entrepreneurship. We have covered 20 Most Immigrant Friendly Countries In The World according to the number of immigrants they currently host and their percentages of migrant stock; give it a read to know which countries are the most accepting of incoming settlers. Inclusion Of Immigrants in the Workforce30.1% of Australia's population is foreign-born, of which, a two thirds are now residents, owing to the country's market-driven immigration policy. As Australia has family reunification, tertiary education, and investment policies for foreign-born people, the country has attracted high-skilled workers from across the globe. As a result of its inclusive education policy, 55% of adult immigrants in Australia have tertiary education. When it comes to the US, a National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) report states that immigrants founded 55% (or 319 of 582) of the US billion-dollar startups. In comparison, 64% of billion-dollar companies in the country have first or second-generation immigrant founders. Likewise, according to the American Immigration Council, immigrants or their children have founded 43.8% of Fortune 500 companies in the country. The strategic value of immigrants extends to generating jobs, advancing technology, and contributing significantly to the GDP.Story continuesNotably, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries rely on temporary migration to meet their labor needs. As evidenced by huge percentages of foreign-born people in Qatar, Kuwait, and UAE, millions of immigrant workers are employed in construction, engineering, and almost every other low-medium income and high-skilled occupation. Even though the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) receives significantly larger numbers of low-skilled workers than other high-income countries, these immigrants don't have citizenship rights. There has also been criticism of workers' poor treatment in the Gulf. According to the World Bank's report, about two-thirds of the labor in Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, while 80–90% in Qatar, Kuwait, and UAE are temporary migrants. Their stay in the host countries can range from months to several decades.Immigration's impact on business isn't merely economic; it also has social implications. Increased cultural diversity within workforces can foster innovation, but it also requires strategies for integration and cultural sensitivity. Moreover, businesses must navigate regulatory frameworks, which differ significantly across nations. For instance, US companies face challenges related to the H-1B visa cap, which limits the number of foreign workers they can employ annually. Australian businesses, however, operate under a points-based immigration system that prioritizes skills and benefits businesses that require a highly skilled workforce. Global immigration patterns further create a transnational economic impact. Remittances, or the funds that immigrants send back to their home countries, are a significant source of external finance for developing countries. According to the World Economic Forum, global remittances reached $794 billion in 2022, up from $128 billion in 2000. The central recipient countries for international remittances are India, China, Mexico, the Philippines, and Egypt, while the US, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and Germany are the main remittance senders, as per the World Migration Report 2022. Factors like the inclusion of immigrants in the workforce and the potential for skilled workers make countries the best for settling. Know more about which nations are winning in these aspects by reading 30 Best Countries in the World.Companies Making Immigrants' Lives EasierSending remittances to home countries used to be a big challenge for immigrants before companies like Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) made international transactions easier. The World Bank has acknowledged the role of The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) in facilitating financial inclusion and economic development in low-income countries by providing accessible remittance channels. The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) 's support for immigrants is evident by its $15M commitment to Opportunity Beyond Borders, a 3-year initiative that aims to help obstacles faced by migrant and refugee youth. Likewise, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) 's subsidiary, Google, provides services that ease immigrants' lives. For instance, Google Translate by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) aids in overcoming language barriers, and Google Maps assists in navigating new cities. More importantly, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has partnered with Coursera to provide learning resources to immigrants that can help them upskill and adapt to the workforces in the countries they move to. In addition, Google.org (Google's philanthropic arm) has donated to organizations like the International Rescue Committee to help refugees and immigrants.Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has partnered with IOM, the UN Migration Agency, to provide financial education to immigrants so they can bypass non-recorded payment routes. Also, after recognizing the need for transparent and secure delivery of humanitarian aid, Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has developed the Mastercard Aid Network. This award-winning, non-monetary technology platform delivers secure resources to people in need. In the broad spectrum, aid can help immigrants and refugees access immediate needs upon arriving in a new country.Let's now find countries with the highest proportions of immigrants. 25 Countries with the Highest Proportion of Immigrants25 Countries with the Highest Proportion of ImmigrantsOur Methodology We ranked countries with the highest proportion of immigrants based on the percentage share of immigrants relative to the respective countries' populations. Our primary source for the proportions of immigrants was the Migration Data Portal which displays the number of immigrants and the population percentage these immigrants make in all countries. Other sources to understand global immigration trends and their impact on economies were The World Bank's Migrants, Refugees, and Societies Report 2022, the World Migration Report 2022, and Knomad Database by the World Bank. Note: While there are subtle differences between immigrants and migrants, for the purpose of this study, we have treated them as the same.Based on our findings, here are the countries with the highest proportion of immigrants:25 countries with the highest proportion of immigrants25. United StatesPercentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 15.3%It's ironic how the country with the largest number of immigrants ranks last among the countries with the highest proportion of immigrants. The number of immigrants in the United States is currently standing at 50.6 million, according to the migration data portal. If we talk about percentages, 15.3% people of the country's current populace of 331 million are foreign-born. Being the largest economy in the world with a current GDP of $25.5 trillion, the US offers work opportunities for incoming settlers along with a benefiting social welfare system. Notably, US natives are getting increasingly unhappy regarding immigrants, as evidenced by a Gallup Poll that shared how 40% of Americans in 2023 want the country's immigrant population to decrease. 24. Norway Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 15.7%In Norway, immigration has become a significant part of demographic growth, and over 15.7% of the total population is foreign-born. Most of these people settle in Norway from Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden. While the country generally offers a high standard of living, there has been debate over integrating immigrants, especially non-European ones. The government has implemented stricter immigration policies over recent years, which makes settling here a long process. 23. Cyprus Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 15.8%Cyprus has a long history of immigration due to its strategic location; the country attracts immigrants from Greece, the UK, and Russia. The immigration process can be complex due to the country's divided status and political challenges. Cyprus' stance towards immigrants can vary based on origin and political considerations, but it is generally seen as moderately accepting. Still, issues such as a strained asylum system have been pressing concerns.22. Belgium Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 17.3%Belgium's central European location makes it a big receiver of international immigrants from other EU countries like Italy, France, Romania, Morocco, and Turkey. Nearly 17.3% of the country's population is foreign-born, owing to its well-established integration policy that provides language and civic courses. However, there are challenges regarding societal integration and labor market accessibility. Public opinion on immigration is mixed, with right-wing parties advocating for more restrictive policies.21. Ireland Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 17.6%Ireland has transformed from an emigrant to an immigrant society and now accepts immigrants from Poland, the UK, and other nations who make up around 17.6% of the total population. The government generally adopts a positive stance towards immigration and views foreign-born people as a means to combat demographic challenges and fill labor shortages. Nevertheless, long waiting times for asylum application processing have sparked criticism and calls for reform.20. Austria Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 18%Austria has a mixed attitude towards immigrants that fluctuates in line with its changing political landscape. For instance, the Austrian People's Party is known for its conservative stance and has often stressed the need for regulated immigration. Nevertheless, immigrants comprise nearly 18% of the population, with a significant portion from former Yugoslavia and Turkey. 19. Germany Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 18.8%Germany is one of the countries with the highest ratio of immigrants. It hosts the 2nd highest number of immigrants that make up the country's 18.8% population as of current. The country's aging population and declining birth rates have encouraged policymakers to accept immigrants as a solution to labor shortages. In 2015, during the refugee crisis, Germany showed exceptional openness by accepting over one million asylum seekers. However, these policies have been met with xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments.18. Iceland Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 19.2%Iceland has a growing immigrant population, accounting for about 19.2% of the total populace, as it has been proactive in accepting refugees. The country has also been encouraging immigration to offset the nation's low birth rate and sustain its strong economic growth. Icelandic society generally shows positive attitudes towards immigrants, and the government has implemented various measures to facilitate their integration, including free language courses and the Multicultural and Information Centre that aims to enhance understanding between Icelanders and immigrant communities.17. Sweden Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 19.8%Sweden is one of the countries with highest proportion of immigrants. It has a multicultural society where 19.8% of the population is born abroad. But notably, the country's generous asylum policies have been tested, particularly following the 2015 refugee crisis. After the huge influx of refugees approached Sweden, along with other countries, tensions surfaced regarding issues of integration and identity. The country accepted approximately 160,000 refugees in 2015 from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. But after that, the Swiss government responded with more restrictive immigration policies and increased focus on integration measures.16. CanadaPercentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 21.3%Canada has inclusive immigration policies, and upwards of 300,000 new immigrants enter the country annually. These policies reflect Canada's commitment to multiculturalism, as immigrants are seen as catalysts for innovation and population growth. Immigrants often receive substantial government support, including language education and job-search assistance. Most Canadian immigrants are from India, China, and Afghanistan. 15. Israel Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 22.6%As Israel is the homeland of the Jewish diaspora, it has a unique approach to immigration, with its Law of Return offering Jewish individuals automatic citizenship. The country saw large influxes of immigrants, particularly from Russia and Ethiopia, in the 1980s and 1990s. However, non-Jewish immigration is highly restricted and often contentious, as seen with African asylum seekers.14. Lebanon Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 25.1%Given its economic condition, Lebanon is surely an unusual name amongst the most welcoming countries for immigrants.

But despite the challenges, the country has a massive influx of immigrants, mainly refugees from neighboring countries, that make up 25.1% of the country's current population. Lebanon hosts the highest number of refugees per capita in the world, primarily Syrians and Palestinians, which eventually result in a high foreign-born population. 13. New Zealand Percentage Of Residents Born in A Foreign Country: 28.7%New Zealand is among the best countries in the world according to immigrants, owing to its high employment rate of foreign-born people and attractiveness for skilled workers.

Never miss another market-moving alert.Amazon smashes Q2 estimatesAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) surged 8% Friday after the tech giant blew Q2 estimates out of the water and nicely topped guidance revenue, riding high off strength in its cloud business.Amazon said its profit came to $0.65 for the quarter - $0.30 better than the consensus of $0.35 - on revenue of $134.4 billion, which also surpassed the $131.45B average analyst estimate.Amazon Web Services, which comprised 70% of its Q2 operating profit, jumped 12% to $22.1B - ahead of estimates for 10.2% growth. The company said this surge came as customers ""started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment.""For the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $138B to $143B vs. estimates for $138.28B.Bernstein called the print ""a defining moment"" during CEO Andy Jassy's tenure, which started about two years ago, and hiked the company's price target by $20 to $175 per share. Bernstein added:Amazon fired on all cylinders: AWS finally stabilizing and now a coiled spring; Retail performance hanging in with a weakened consumer; N. American retail margins are back to pre-pandemic levels and accelerating alongside compressing fulfillment windows — impressive; and aggregate operating profits are up and to the right.BofA said Amazon remains ""our top stock in sector"" given Amazon's retail cost improvement efforts, saying it expects ""several more quarters of margin benefits from increasing retail efficiency."" BofA added that AWS is ""seemingly poised to accelerate"" given the ""end of Cloud spending optimization cycle amidst easing comps.""Story continuesBarclays concurred, writing that AWS is ""likely re-accelerating on regular/AI workloads,"" adding that ""retail growth is steady and margins may overshoot the 2018 peak.""""It's finally time to sit back and enjoy the ride,"" Barclays wrote.Shares booked a weekly gain of 4.8% gain to $139.57Apple slumps on iPhone worriesApple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 4.8% Friday after the iPhone maker reported its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, even though fiscal third-quarter results topped estimates.iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of Apple's total top line, fell to $39.67 billion from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B. And revenue overall totaled $81.8B - better than the $81.73 consensus, but down from $83B a year earlier.Strength in Apple's services business helped offset the soft iPhone sales: Revenue from Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other service units, grew to $21.21B from $19.60B a year earlier, ahead of estimates of $20.76B.As for its bottom line, earnings per share came to $1.26, also topping estimates for $1.19.Regarding the iPhone softness, in the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects iPhone and services performance to ""accelerate from the June quarter"" year over year. He also predicted more double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales, ""particularly on the Mac,"" due to difficult comparisons vs. the prior year.In fiscal Q3, iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3. missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B.Still, given the expected acceleration in iPhone sales and services, as well as the gross margin expansion, Citi opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on AAPL stock.""Post Jun-Q earnings through new Phone launch the stock historically outperformed NASDAQ 5 out 7 times and S&amp;P500 all 7 times, or 8% on average since 2016,"" Citi wrote in a note.On the other hand, BofA remains sidelined:We remain Neutral as positive catalysts of new product introduction and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment. ...The guidance suggests typical launch timing for iPhones but with the backdrop of a weak US smartphone market we think it’s unlikely that iPhone rev significantly re-accelerates.Shares ended the week down 7.2% to $181.99.AMD sees a roller coaster week after Q2Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares took a slide on its Q2 results amid analyst concerns about guidance, but the stock strongly recovered after Morgan Stanley said the selloff was overdone.AMD's Q2 EPS came in at $0.58 per share, a penny better than consensus, and Q3 guidance also topped consensus - but Bernstein said it fears estimates ""remain too high"" amid optimism around AI ""and the stock... looks a little stretched to us,"" according to Reuters.Oppenheimer was also cautious, writing, ""We remain sidelined as AMD’s AI strategy proves out.""Revenue totaled $5.4B, better than the $5.32B analyst expectations, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company's AI engagements climbed by more than seven times ""as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale.""The stock more than recovered, ending with a 1.6% gain for the week to $115.82, after Morgan Stanley said it sees the stock as a ""significant outperformer"" relative to other chip stocks at current levels. The analyst added:Guidance for flat y/y servers in 3q - up 15-20% q/q - with clear eyes about the current cloud weakness should be an indication that share gains and the delayed Genoa ramp are in good shape. We expected the stock to be up meaningfully.Citi, for its part, upgraded AMD to Buy from Neutral immediately after the Q2 results, bumping its price target by $16 to $136 per share.""We thought AMD’s AI products (MI300) would be margin dilutive and investors would eventually care about the expensive valuation on AMD, and we were wrong on both counts,"" the analysts said.Qualcomm falls on soft guidanceQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) fell more than 8% Thursday after the company reported underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and delivered mixed fiscal Q3 results amid softer smartphone demand.The chipmaker reported adjusted EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $8.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.81 on revenue of $8.51B.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided EPS in the range of $1.80 to $2 - the midpoint of which is below Wall Street estimates for $1.94 - on revenue of between $8.1B to $8.9B, which compares with estimates for $8.77B.""The midpoint of our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 guidance includes the continued impact of the macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and channel inventory drawdown,"" the company said.Deutsche Bank downgraded the QCOM stock to Hold with a price target lowered by $10 to $120 per share. While the company was in line with the analysts' estimates, it was concerned with management's ""soft commentary"" around its December quarter and ""incremental headwinds in 2024.""CFRA, meanwhile, lifted the price target by $2 to $125 per share on the Hold-rated QCOM stock. The firm wrote:Although we expect QCOM's under-shipping of true demand is likely to come to an end over the next 3-6 months, we remain wary of QCOM to potentially start losing Apple business by late CY 24.Qualcomm shares partially recovered on Friday, but ended the week with a 6.4% loss to $121.50.PayPal plummets on gross profit worriesPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) plunged more than 12% Thursday, after edging out Q2 top- and bottom-line estimates, on worries regarding its gross profit growth.PayPal said it earned $1.16 per share in Q2 on revenue of $7.29 billion. Analysts polled by InvestingPro anticipated EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $7.27B.But the company's total payment volume (TPV), or transaction revenue less transaction expenses and transaction losses, rose just 1% from the prior year.After the print, Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to In Line from Outperform, saying it sees ""increasing headwinds to revenue and earnings growth"" due to ""intensifying competition, evidenced by the sequential loss of 2.5 million consumer accounts (0.6% of total accounts) combined with nearly 300 basis point of transaction margin pressure.""The analyst added: ""Without a clear path to year-over-year transaction margin expansion, we see limited scope for earnings outperformance.""Bernstein also voiced concerns about TPV growth pressures, adding that gross profit (GP) growth ""is essentially the true revenue for the company."" The analyst added:Transaction GP is a critical health metric, especially because TPV growth is an outcome of many businesses with vastly different gross margins. ...

(NYSE:BAX) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.29 per share on the 2nd of October. This makes the dividend yield 2.6%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Baxter International Baxter International's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Even though Baxter International isn't generating a profit, it is generating healthy free cash flows that easily cover the dividend. We generally think that cash flow is more important than accounting measures of profit, so we are fairly comfortable with the dividend at this level.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 6.8%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.80 total annually to $1.16. The dividend has shrunk at around 4.3% a year during that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Baxter International's EPS has fallen by approximately 48% per year during the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Baxter International's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. We don't think Baxter International is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

(NYSE:ROK) Looks Interesting, And It's About To Pay A Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-inc-nyse-rok-120354483.html,1691323434,STORY,['ROK'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase Rockwell Automation's shares before the 11th of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.18 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.72 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Rockwell Automation stock has a trailing yield of around 1.6% on the current share price of $298.82. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Rockwell Automation's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Rockwell Automation paying out a modest 38% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 67% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that Rockwell Automation's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Fortunately for readers, Rockwell Automation's earnings per share have been growing at 14% a year for the past five years. Rockwell Automation is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Rockwell Automation has increased its dividend at approximately 9.6% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Rockwell Automation an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Rockwell Automation and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today another positive story to share with you this quarter, and you can see some of those highlighted here and called out on Slide 2. First of all, adjusted EBITDA up 8%, adjusted earnings per share up 5%, and our gathering volumes were up 6%. And certainly, while this growth and beat is impressive, our resiliency in the face of low commodity prices is even more impressive and gave us another opportunity to distinguish ourselves from the pack, which is largely post to declines this quarter. And our growth continues to compound despite these price swings in natural gas. This quarter was a perfect example where we saw an 8% EBITDA increase on the back of a very strong 14% increase for the same period last year. John will dive deeper into the numbers in a moment, but let me start out with a few highlights from the quarter. Our financial performance is our track record, but it is the day-to-day focus on execution by our teams that drives these results and really does set us apart. As an example, our teams have done a fantastic job of quickly integrating the MountainWest acquisition into our core business, and in fact, we’re pleased to announce that we’ve already secured binding precedent agreements to support a significant expansion on the newly acquired Overthrust Pipeline. This project was not even in our upside case for this investment, and the team has identified even more growth to come that is beyond our original expectations. Much of this growth is centered around coal to natural gas conversions in the western states. On Transco, we continue to advance our emission reduction program and recently completing – completed our first large scale compressor replacement project in Virginia, our backlog of high return pipeline expansion opportunities continues to progress driven by a large wave of incremental demand that continues to exceed our expectations. As evidence of this continued wave of increasing demand, we recently concluded a non-binding open season to advance another large scale Transco project that will provide much needed capacity to serve our customers South of Station 165 in Virginia. Our customers recent – customers requested capacity that has been well in excess of the 800,000 dekatherms per day that we offered. Importantly, the minimum required term for this service offering was 20 years. This underscores our belief in the durable and fast growing demand for capacity and the market’s confidence in our ability to deliver this capacity with the lowest environmental impact. Following the approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. We’re now working to find a way to serve as much of our customers’ needs as possible and hope to have an update on this exciting project soon. Moving on to financial performance, as I stated earlier, despite a weakened natural gas price environment, our financial results not only grew against a difficult comp in a difficult environment, but this quarter marked the 30th consecutive earnings print that either met or exceeded consensus estimates. Within our legacy based business in the Northeast, we produced record EBITDA and record gathering volumes delivering growth that far outpaced the total production across Marcellus. Our strategy to focus on connecting our producing customers to the best markets with the most reliable service available has grown this business to the point it is nearing $2 billion per year of EBITDA. The completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, our Regional Energy Access project and continued growth of gas-fired generation in the local market will continue to provide market and volume growth well into the future. In the West, we also achieve record gathering volumes once again showing that our diverse geographic position is built to weather commodity price swings. In our transmission in Gulf of Mexico segment, we are enjoying the beginnings of a long runway of growth in the deepwater gearing up for a long string of expansions on Transco and enjoying better than expected growth in our MountainWest acquisition, which speaks to our successful integration. Importantly, the strength of our base business more than offset weaker E&amp;P earnings and expected low seasonal cash flows from our marketing business. The quarter’s results continue to prove out the inherent stability and stubborn growth of our business. However, when we see the market fail to appreciate our ability to deliver in most price environments, we will continue to execute on our authorized repurchase program much like we did during the second quarter. And finally, a few notes on our sustainability efforts. Last week, we issued our 2022 sustainability report and completed our annual CDP Climate Questionnaire. These are both important markers that detail our progress on key issues like environmental stewardship, community sport, and workforce development. To us, sustainability means running our business in a way that will create value for the perpetual shareholder. So we’re proud to have also be providing our shareholders with industry-leading returns on invested capital, and we expect our shareholders to further benefit from enhanced capital returns as we execute on our large growth backlog, which among others include seven out of nine major pipeline projects that are coming online in the fourth quarter of 2024 and that will be stacked on top of a solid foundation of a sustainable based business. And with that, I’m going to turn things over to John to walk us through the financial metrics of the quarter. John? John Porter: Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance, beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw another strong quarterly increase of 8% over the prior year, and this happens to coincide with an 8.6% CAGR over the last five years for this same measure. And this strong performance included a new record for gathering volumes, which increase 6%. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA is now up 13% driven by the growth of our core infrastructure businesses, which continue to perform very well, even as natural gas price decreased 61% for the first half of 2023 versus the first half of 2022, once again, demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our natural gas focused strategy, our assets, and our operational capabilities. For second quarter, our adjusted EPS increased 5% for the quarter, continuing the strong growth we’ve had in EPS over the last many years with our year-to-date EPS now up 23%. Available funds from operations AFFO growth for second quarter was in line with adjusted EBITDA and you see our second quarter dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.23 times growing about 2% despite growing our dividend by 5.3%. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen with debt to adjusted EBITDA now reaching 3.5 times versus last year’s 3.82 times and that’s even after closing the Trace, NorTex and MountainWest acquisitions and also repurchasing $139 million worth of shares since last year. On CapEx, you see an increase primarily reflecting the progress we’re making on some of our key growth projects, including Regional Energy Access and Louisiana Energy Gateway. For the full year, there’s no change to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion or any of our other guidance metrics. But in a moment, I’ll provide a little color on our expectations for the remainder of the year versus the performance we’ve seen thus far in 2023. So let’s turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the second quarter results. A strong 8% increase in EBITDA over prior year even as average natural gas prices for the second quarter decreased 71% walking now from last year’s roughly $1.5 billion to this year’s $1.6 billion, we start with our Upstream joint venture operations that are included in our other segment, which were down $43 million versus last year. Our Haynesville Upstream EBITDA was down about $14 million despite substantially higher production due to much lower net realized prices and a lower working interest percentage on new wells beginning in January of 2023. Our Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was down $29 million due primarily to lower realized prices, but production also continued to be impacted throughout April from the historically difficult Wyoming winter weather we saw in the first quarter. Shifting now to our core business performance, our transmission in Gulf of Mexico business improved $96 million or 15%, including about a $52 million contribution from our MountainWest Pipeline and NorTex acquisitions, but with other increases in our transmission and deepwater revenues as well. Our Northeast G&amp;P business performed extremely well with a $65 million or 14% increase, driven by an $81 million increase in service revenues. And we did have a one-time $14 million favorable gathering revenue catch up adjustment in that second quarter increase in service revenue. But this revenue increase was really fueled by a 6% increase in total volumes in the Northeast. Shifting now to the west, which increased to $16 million or 5%, benefiting from continued strong volume growth in the Haynesville and positive hedge results that partially offset the impact of lower commodity base rates. And then you see the $22 million decrease in our Gas and NGL Marketing business and the majority of this decline was actually related to lower NGL marketing results from inventory valuation changes where we had to gain on NGL inventories last year at a loss this year. So again, the second quarter continued our strong start to 2023 with 8% growth in EBITDA driven by core infrastructure business performance in spite of natural gas prices that were 71% lower than second quarter of 2022. So let’s turn the page and touch on the year-to-date comparison. Year-to-date, we’ve seen a 13% increase over 2022, walking now from last year’s $3 billion to this year’s $3.4 billion, we start with the upstream joint venture operations included in our other segment, which were down $39 million versus last year. Now, year-to-date, Haynesville is up nicely on very strong volume growth that has been significantly offset by lower realized prices. However, the overall Haynesville increase was offset by lower Wamsutter results due primarily to the historically difficult winter weather we saw in Wyoming this year. Shifting now to our core business performance, transmission in Gulf of Mexico business improved $127 million or 9% that’s really similar themes as our second quarter, namely the impacts of the MountainWest Pipeline and NorTex acquisitions, however, we have seen other significant increases in our transmission and deepwater revenues as well. Our Northeast G&amp;P business has performed very well with $117 million or 13% increase driven by $154 million increase in service revenue. This revenue increase was fueled by a 7% increase in total volumes focused in our liquids rich areas where we tend to have higher per unit margin than our dry gas areas. And in the appendix, you’ll find a slide that compares our 7% volume growth to the overall basin growth of just under 2%. Shifting now to the West, which increased $42 million or 8%, benefiting from positive hedge results and the Trace acquisition, but the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by the severe Wyoming weather and January processing economics at our Opal Wyoming processing plant. And then you see the $144 million increase in our Gas and NGL Marketing business caused by the strong first quarter that we had at the start of the year. So again, a continuation to the strong start to 2023 with 13% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance with strength from our marketing business that dramatically overcame weaker than expected results from the upstream joint ventures. So as I mentioned earlier, there’s no change to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion or any of our other guidance metrics. We’ve definitely had a strong start to the year with $3.4 billion of EBITDA through the first half of the year. And thanks to the performance of our base business we have clear visibility to hitting at least the mid-point of our guidance even after a historic decline in natural gas prices and a historically difficult winter that continue to have impacts through April. So you may be wondering, why we aren’t raising our guidance on the back of such a strong start to the year and a bright future ahead. First, I will remind you that our guidance does include a range of $200 million above our midpoint. And second, while we usually experience stronger third and fourth quarters than second quarter, the third quarter does occasionally see hurricane outages for our deepwater business. Finally, we could also still see downward shifts in natural gas prices for the balance of the year that could unfavorably impact our upstream joint ventures in particular. While we are not suggesting, there is a high likelihood of realizing these impacts, we do need to be prepared to overcome these scenarios. Therefore, it is too early to raise our full year guidance. But once again, we are confident in the continued performance of our base infrastructure businesses, allowing us to once again meet or exceed the midpoint of our guidance range. We’re setting our sites on continued growth in 2024 before another big growth step in 2025. And with that, I’ll turn it back to Alan. Alan Armstrong: Okay. Thanks, John. Just a few closing remarks before we open it up for your questions here. First, I’ll start by reiterating our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. We are the most natural gas centric large scale midstream company around today and the integrated nature of our business from our best-in-class long haul pipes to our formidable gathering assets, which are complimented by our Sequent platform that delivers upside to our base business is unique and we have a track record to prove it. Second, our combination of proven resilience, five year EPS CAGR of 23%, industry leading coverage on our steadily growing dividend, a strong balance sheet and high visibility to growth we think is unique amongst the S&amp;P 500 and unique within our sector. Let me emphasize that our natural gas focused strategy has allowed us to produce a 10-year track record of growing adjusted EBITDA through a number of commodity and economic cycles. And it is continuing to deliver significant growth in the current environment. And we’re now celebrating 7.5 years of delivering inline or better quarterly results. That is especially impressive when you consider the sectors ups and downs over this period. And the fundamentals are setting up stronger than ever for this long-term predictable growth to continue. And finally, as we think about our long-term strategy, we see that U.S. natural gas infrastructure is key to meeting both today’s energy demand as well as projected growth of electrification and renewables build out in the future. Simply put, you cannot implement and accelerate wind, solar and large scale electrification without having natural gas as a reliable complimentary partner to these big system changes. In fact, despite continued growth in solar and wind capacity, the country saw record natural gas power demand in July, reaching as high as 53 Bcf per day last week to meet summer power loads. This tops the previous record set last July by 6%, again, compounding growth on top of compounding growth. And so if we truly do want to meet our country’s growing power demand for things like data centers and EVs and accelerate wind and solar power generation, we must continue increasing natural gas infrastructure capacity. This fact has become evident to both the majority of our legislators and the Biden administration as they came out with unprecedented support for Mountain Valley Pipeline’s completion. Williams is here for the long haul and we are committed to leveraging our large scale natural gas infrastructure network for the benefit of generations to come. And with that, I’ll open it up for your questions. See also Top 20 Electronic Gadgets for a Smart Home and 15 Most Walkable Cities in the US.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you, Mr. Armstrong. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question this morning from Spiro Dounis at Citi. Spiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. First question, maybe start with gas macro. Looks like, we’re maybe approaching a trough here and some of the producer activity. So just curious to get your all’s view on what your producer customers are seeing and doing and really just how you’re thinking about the volume and price trajectory from here as we head into 2024 and really wait for LNG volumes to pick up a lot of the slack. Alan Armstrong: Yes. Spiro, well, certainly, I wouldn’t say, there’s one answer to that question, but maybe I’ll try to summarize it a little bit. I think the majority of producers see a pretty bright future for demand right now. And as a result of that, they’re making sure that they’re not letting their systems fall into decline in a way that’d be hard to recover from. So I would say, they are much like a cat kind of poised for demand growth in the future, but really watching cost and trimming out cost where they can and kind of proving up their capabilities in certain areas. So I would say, it feels to me like the producers are trying to maintain level volumes as much as possible, but being poised for future demand growth, that’s pretty evident down the road. Spiro Dounis: Yes. It’s helpful. Second question is maybe moving to leverage as you guys pointed out, you’re down to about 3.5 times now this quarter, so already below your target on the year. So just curious how you’re thinking about utilizing this excess balancing capacity. Is that the plan or really maybe even thinking about operating at these lower levels? Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say, I think we really enjoy the flexibility that we have right now and we’ve been pretty clear about capital allocation. It’s nice to have a – such a large pool of ability to invest in our rate base at some pretty decent returns, and I think probably even some higher returns once we get through the next rate case, given the inflation and the cost of debt that’s gone up, that will drive us to be able to earn even an higher return in our rate base. So that’s really nice to have that pool of capital to be able to invest in. And that really kind of sits at the bottom of our stack of capital allocation, but team’s doing a great job of deploying that. As I mentioned, we completed our Station 180, which is a very large compressor station in [indiscernible] and the team brought that in a little bit ahead of schedule, and Michael and I actually got to go up there a few weeks ago and see that great effort by the team of modernizing our facilities there. And so anyway, I would just say to answer your question more directly, we have places to place capital for nice return like that and I think we’ll continue to do that, but we certainly enjoy the flexibility that we have at this level to be able to place capital towards those kinds of opportunities. Spiro Dounis: Great. I’ll leave it there. Thanks for the time guys. Operator: Thank you. We go next down to Jeremy Tonet at JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Alan Armstrong: Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off with Appalachia, if I could Northeast G&amp;P quite a good quarter there, recognize there’s a little bit of timing with the revenue catch up there. But just wondering if you could talk a bit more about what’s a normalized EBITDA level in the Northeast G&amp;P right now. And are you seeing kind of a shift in production wet versus dry and is that impacting margins, just trying to get a bit of color for what the trajectory is here? Alan Armstrong: Yes. I definitely think we saw producers focusing, where they have it available. We saw producers focusing on wet where there are producers that have that ability to shift. But while at the same time, I think keeping themselves poised for markets to open up. And so I would say, that’s kind of what we’ve seen. In terms of normalized EBITDA, I think the first two quarters are a pretty good sign of that. I think anytime you can just average that out over a couple of quarters, I think that’s a pretty good sign of a normalized number. But I do think as markets open up through both MountainWest and Regional Energy Access and continued industrial and power generation demand in the local markets, I think we’re going to see that PJM, certainly found itself very short power lasts year or – and during the winter time as well. And I think we’re going to continue to see people build out power generation to take advantage of that. So I’m pretty encouraged, frankly, about in terms of the market outlook over the next couple of years for the Northeast. I do think that we’ll see the Northeast have an opportunity to take back some of the market share across the U.S. as a result of some of these markets opening up.Jeremy Tonet: That’s very helpful. And just to clarify, when you say new markets opening up, is this regional energy that kind of prime in the [indiscernible] or MVP or others? Alan Armstrong: Well, there’s really three distinct issues there. Mountain Valley Pipeline certainly, and it’ll be competing. There’s been some confusion out there. I think in the market, we have plenty of capacity to pull all that MountainWest can deliver. It’s just a question of how it’s going to compete with Haynesville gas coming in at Station 85 on the system. And so there – but there’s – it’s just going to be a question of producers competing for those markets. But I will say that market in particularly at south of Station 165, as was demonstrated by a recent open season is going to continue to grow pretty rapidly. And last winter got caught in a very short situation on natural gas. And so we’re going to continue to see the markets in the Carolinas there and Virginia and the Southeast continue to expand. Mountain Valley Pipeline’s going to be that connection. In addition to that Regional Energy Access is also going to provide new market and that’ll take some time. It’s not going to be a snap your fingers and we’ll see that kind of growth pulled out of that area, but it will open up new markets and new demand. And then finally, as I mentioned, regional loads in the area as well and people taking advantage of low price natural gas, and in fact, the shell big cracker there is just one good example of the industry growth, but as well we’re seeing power generation load to continue to build there as well in the PJM area. So I think really pretty clear examples of market growth for the Northeast. Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Very helpful. And just one more on gas, if I could. I think in our stakeholder conversations across various states, we’re starting to see gas peakers come back into integrated resource planning that we had not seen in recent years or maybe had fallen out in recent years. And just wondering if you’re seeing this trend as well, particularly as it relates to Transco and its unique positioning? And could this lead to incremental opportunities beyond kind of what’s in the slides today? Alan Armstrong: Yes. I think as we mentioned, the open season that we had for capacity south of 165 really kind of caught our attention, frankly, and far exceeded our expectations. And so when we say that it exceeded what we had to offer, it was a very large multiple versus what we had to offer there. So yes, we definitely are seeing the signs of people taking advantage of low price natural gas. And importantly, I think this is something that gets missed too often, Jeremy, I know you follow this, but I think sometimes the broader investor base misses this that – what we have to sell is capacity. It doesn’t mean that that’s going to be an annual average increase in volume as much as it does mean that people are absolutely going to have to buy capacity for those peakers and for baseload. And we actually, I think we’re going to see quite a bit of baseload pick up as well, because the amount of data centers, the amount of electrification load that’s going on is well in excess of what our increasing wind and solar generation can keep up with. And so we’re not only going to see peaking, we’re going to see baseload increase as well. But again, all of that boils down, whether it’s peaking or it’s baseload, people still have to buy the full amount of capacity on our pipeline. And that’s certainly coming through in these open seasons that we’ve been having on – in that area. Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Right. Makes sense. Coal to gas baseload conversion clearly there, but the peaking needs – I think it seems a bit underappreciated. So very helpful color. Thank you for that. Alan Armstrong: Thank you. Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next now to Jean Ann Salisbury at Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the comment that was just made Alan about there being plenty of capacity on Transco and it kind of being a competition between the Haynesville producers and the Appalachian producers. I think that for the open season for the 800,000, that timeline is kind of set for 2027. So is it accurate to say that capacity is there, but sort of needs to be unlocked to be usable over the next few years? Alan Armstrong: Well, also Jean Ann, you have to realize I think we have six projects along that exist, along that corridor or five along that corridor, excluding Regional Energy Access that are also expansions in that same area that were not dependent on Mountain Valley Pipeline supplies coming into that area. And so there’s a number of projects that and we got them listed there in our materials. So that is – obviously those come on before this latest open season would, but those are increments to serve increasing demand for power generation in the Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia areas. Jean Ann Salisbury: Okay. But they’re kind of – I guess, maybe my broader question is like, if – like, there need to be projects that Williams does that are kind of negotiated rate incremental contract.Alan Armstrong: Well, yes, the point I think that’s misunderstood, Jean Ann, is that we have the physical capacity to move that gas from Station 165 period into sentence and not very complicated. We have plenty of capacity to move from that point. The piece I think that got missed by some of the market consultants was the fact that the – how much would actually move from that point, because people are already buying supplies from Station 180 – or sorry, Station 85 and moving it north, but those same shippers have the ability to pick their gas up at 165 if they choose to. So it’s just going to be a matter of where they decide to pick their gas. But we have plenty of capacity to move gas out of station, the 2 Bcf a day out of 165. So the physical capacity exists, the shippers actually are the ones that decide how we operate the system and where we move the gas from. And if they decide, they want to buy it at 165, 85 will get backed off and 165 will get picked up for supplies. Jean Ann Salisbury: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, there was a big tick up in NGL and crude volumes that you classify as Overland Pass and Rocky Mountain Midstream this quarter. What was driving that? Michael Dunn: Hey, Jean Ann, this is Michael. Some of that was Bakken volumes coming in on the OPPL line from a third-party as well as some methane volumes that picked up in the quarter. Jean Ann Salisbury: Great. That’s all for me. Thank you. Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Jean Ann. Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Brian Reynolds at UBS. Brian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe to start off in the 2023 outlook, John, you talked in the prepared remarks about year-to-date outperformance, which supports at least the midpoint. But just kind of curious if you can give some commentary around, uncertainty around these hurricanes in nat gas pricing. Is that baked in to your confidence over the midpoint and thus just assuming constructive or normalized second half fundamentals, just kind of curious if you could sensitize the upper end of the range as well. Thanks. John Porter: Yes. I think we want to have a lot of confidence in hitting our midpoint. So we do account for things that could happen around the hurricane season and perhaps additional weakness that could come, as I mentioned, from a further decline in natural gas prices. So we’ve built in some ability to handle those kinds of downsides relative to making sure that we can hit our midpoint. So I think conversely, the things that would move us higher in the range would just be better than forecasted performance in the underlying gathering and processing systems in the base business, which is always possible. And it is also possible that we could have a stronger marketing result in the fourth quarter. Sometimes we have fairly strong for example, Novembers and Decembers, but that is unpredictable. Most of that performance comes in the first quarter. So we don’t like to overly depend on any kind of a marketing result to make the numbers. And so we got a lot of confidence just from the base business around hitting the midpoint of our guidance and certainly think we could exceed it as well, but still fairly early in the year and just weren’t comfortable yet in raising the guidance. Brian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate… Alan Armstrong: Brian, I would just add – yes, I would just add to that. On the natural gas – sorry, on our marketing business that I think it’s really important to recognize that really what drove the negative in there was primarily just the markdown on NGL inventory. So that’s just – that’s not really cash, moving through the books, it’s just a change in price on the inventory that we hold. And so unless you – if we were to mark that book right now, obviously, you’d see a pretty big step up in that, just because ethane prices have come up so much. But I think that’s really important for the Street to understand relative to balance of the year. Brian Reynolds: Appreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. As my follow-up, great to see the environmental assessment for the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway Project to bring nat gas from Texas into the Louisiana border. LNG demand continues to be a theme, particularly on gas E&amp;P calls this quarter. So just kind of curious if you could just discuss perhaps further greenfield opportunities beyond TLEP that Williams could pursue to bring even more natural gas from Texas across to LNG to support that future demand. Thanks. Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Well, I would tell you we are engaged in a number of projects there. And we’re not in a position to be able to disclose those at this point, but we are involved in some pretty large scale projects that we’re excited about and we think we’ll add a lot of value to our shareholders as well as the industry in general and much needed. So we’re pretty excited about that, but we’re not in a position yet to disclose exactly what’s going on there. Brian Reynolds: Great. Makes sense. We’ll leave it there. Enjoy the rest of your morning. Thanks. Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Brian. Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Praneeth Satish at Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish: Good morning. I guess, on Southeast Supply Enhancement, first, do you think the project could be upsized given that you noted a very strong open season? And then I guess, I’m still confused maybe a little bit on the lead time. The lead time for the project seems pretty long. It has an in-service date of Q4 2027. Is there anything in particular causing the timeline to be that long or is there may be a contingency in there for permitting?Michael Dunn: Hi, good morning, Praneeth. This is Michael. Yes, the open season results were a pleasant surprise and we’re currently working through the scenarios with the various customers that requested capacity there. It definitely can be upsized from the 800,000 to be published in the open season notice and we’re just working through that today. So hopefully, we’ll have some more information on that in the very near future in regard to the outcome of those negotiations. But it’s really just a combination of looping and compression additions alongside our brownfield Transco pipeline corridor. And it’s just getting the hydraulic modeling done and developing the proper scenarios and then ultimately giving the rates to the customers that would be identified by the looping and compression on those scenarios. So it’s a little bit of an iterative process, which we’re going through right now, but it can definitely be upside from the 800,000 a day. I’d say the schedule, right now, a lot of that’s driven by the customer’s desired in service date. And so a lot of this capacity is for new gas-fired power generation and anticipating when those new power plants come online is the expectation that the customer’s laying out there for us. I do think there may be an opportunity to accelerate the project at some point, but obviously we have to have customer agreements in place before we can start designing the desired schedule for the customers as well as our capital cash flow. So that’s really what we’re looking at right now. I think 2027 is probably the outside date that we’d be looking at and we’ll try to pull that in where we can. Praneeth Satish: Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess, just looking at the futures curve for natural gas, it’s in Contango, it’s pretty wide winter, summer spread right now. Just wondering if you could kind of talk through your ability to capture that at Sequent. I guess how much storage capacity does it have right now and how much of that is open and able to take advantage of these wider spreads? Michael Dunn: Yes, absolutely. The Sequent has a very large storage portfolio. I don’t know that we’ve actually disclosed the aggregate size of it is, but it is a very large storage portfolio and we would expect them to be able to lock in the intrinsic value of that storage. And they also have a lot of deliverability capabilities out of that storage and can optimize around that storage position as well. I don’t think we’ve given a lot of the specifics about the aggregate size of that storage position, but it is a strong storage position that we would expect them to be able to lock in a lot of value around. Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would just add to that, the way we would book those earnings, we actually would not book those earnings until we delivered. And so that’s really why our fourth – sorry, our first quarter is usually pretty sizable for us is that’s when you see the pricing and the most value for that storage is usually offered in that period. And so that’s a great example of why our first quarter tends to be so large. Some of that, like we said, make them in the fourth quarter depending on what pricing looks like and if we can cycle that storage twice, but we do have to cycle it to be able to take the earnings on that. Praneeth Satish: Got it. Thank you. Operator: We’ll go next now to Colton Bean at TPH and Company. Colton Bean: Good morning. I was just following up on the question on the Northeast saw it’s pretty significant sequential increase in G&amp;P revenue. I know you mentioned the $14 million benefit from a catch up payment there. But even after adjusting for that, it seems like the year-on-year increase is still well above what we would’ve expected from inflation escalators alone. So I guess, are there any other contractual provisions that are pushing unit rates higher across the basin there? John Porter: No, I think really – as was asked earlier, the question of rich versus lean, obviously when there’s more rich gas drilling, there’s a lot more services that we offer around that. And so that does – that shift to richer gas does tend to drive our margin – our unit margin up across the basin. Colton Bean: Okay. And that’s primarily showing up in gathering I think on a processing basis volumes looked pretty consistent. Alan Armstrong: Yes. Right. Colton Bean: Got it. Okay. And then two related questions on cost control. I think if we look at the transmission segment, it looks like OpEx is roughly flat to your pre-acquisition levels after adjusting for the transaction expenses there. So you seeing MountainWest synergies materialize earlier than expected, or should we expect some degree of cost increase moving forward? And then just more broadly, it looks like pretty impressive cost control across all segments expenses flat to down on a year-over-year basis. So if you could just comment more broadly on your cost control initiatives and expectations through the balance of the year.Michael Dunn: Yes. Colton, thanks for that recognition. Yes, the team’s doing a great job controlling our costs even in this inflationary environment. We have found some ways to actually continue to take cost out of the business and as you’ve indicated, the MountainWest acquisition is really the cost increase that we’re seeing there on the e-comm side of the business. And so I think going through the balance of the year, we would have an expectation that we can continue that cost control. Now, there’s always a lot of variability throughout the second and third quarters with our maintenance activities and our overhauls that are recurring and that would be the only variance that we would see there typically coming up between the second and third quarter, but other than that team’s doing a great job controlling costs this year. Colton Bean: Great. Thank you. Operator: We’ll go next now to Neel Mitra of Bank of America. Neel Mitra: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to clarify on Jean Ann’s question, the available capacity on Transco. So if I understood it right, are you saying that there’s available capacity on Transco from MVP if you were to back off volumes from Zone 4? So it essentially would be shifting volumes from one area to another to accommodate the existing utility demand. And then I guess the follow on to that would be to accommodate new growth and new demand from utilities, there would need to be Transco expansions. Am I thinking about that the right way? Alan Armstrong: Yes. Neel, let me try explain it one more time. The way the most of the system rates work on there, the shippers have pay the same price, they pay us no matter where the gas is moving from. Generally the – those utilities in that corridor have the ability to pick up gas and they have a volume available that they can pull from at various receipt points. And so they basically are out trying to buy the lowest price gas on the system that they can have delivered into their meters every day. And when we talk about system capacities, we’re actually talking about kind of the delivery capacity to those locations, and it’s – this particular path that somebody buys capacity from on the system. But the big long haul system and the original base system, the shippers have the ability to choose where they want to pull their supply in from. And so even if they’re – we have a number of expansions going on, but even if you just looked at it in a static environment, if somebody today was buying gas Station 85, that gas is likely coming in from either system gas on in the Offshore or Haynesville or gas that’s made its way in from the Permian. But Station 85 or 65 would be a place that customers would be nominating their supplies from and they’d be buying gas from maybe a Haynesville producer at Station 85. If they – if somebody from the Marcellus decides, they want to sell their gas cheaper at 165, then that customer’s going to be able to say, well, I’m going to nominate from Station 165 – at the 165 location instead of 85. Same amount of gas eventually flows to their delivery point. But it’s just a matter of where they source their supply from. So in – so we – it’s just going to be a question of where producers decide to sell their gas set and who wants to compete the most for those supplies. As we build out the system and the demand then matches back up to that supply then the system would be back in balance. And – but that’s the way it always worked. There’s always periods where supply builds up because you have more supply locations, then you have delivery, and then eventually you build out the delivery market like we’re doing in all these projects. And then more supply is needed, which is kind of the situation at Station – sorry, at Zone 5 right now. People got caught short there in the winter because there was not enough supply coming in there. So MVP will provide that needed supply that was missing this last winter. Neel Mitra: Yes. I think maybe the confusion is whether if all things are static and you didn’t back anything off of Zone 4, how much could you move South on Transco down from Zone 165 with the MVP volumes that are coming in? Alan Armstrong: Well, it doesn’t have to just move South. It can move North and South. So I think that’s maybe the missing concept there is the gas can – will move wherever the market is, but we certainly have more demand on the system in both directions from 165 than 2 Bcf a day. Neel Mitra: Got it, got it. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Alan Armstrong: Thank you. Operator: We’ll go next now to Tristan Richardson of Scotiabank. Tristan Richardson: Hey, good morning, guys. Just curious your views on the transmission M&amp;A landscape. I mean, it seems like the funnel of assets in the market is really only growing and clearly we’ve seen a lot of transactions clear the past 12 months, even if they’re passive stakes. Have you just seen more opportunities that would potentially be a strategic bid? And then do you see these multiples as attractive in transmission with some of the transactions we’ve seen clear?Alan Armstrong: Yes. Good question, Tristan. I would just say we were really pleased with multiple, we were able to pick up the MountainWest assets pretty seldom that you get assets that are – that well contracted that have that much growth around them, which frankly has been more than we even expected. Pretty rare to see that kind of multiple. I think that the issue there that kind of dampen the market was the concerns over Hart-Scott-Rodino that had been raised earlier in the Berkshire Hathaway and Dominion transaction that involved those assets. And I think that had the market a little bit spooked on that. So maybe that’s why we were able to bridge over that in that case. But yes, so I would say, we’re going to keep looking for those anomalies like that and where we have confidence in our ability to add value to assets. But I think it’s going to be rare circumstances that we see those kind of multiple. There’s usually a reason in this case, I think a lot of the issue was the risk around Hart-Scott-Rodino that it already surfaced itself on those assets earlier. Tristan Richardson: That’s helpful, Alan. And then maybe just a question on MountainWest, I mean, with the Overthrust Expansion, sounded like that was maybe incremental to your expectations or at least what you saw as the opportunity set for the acquisition at the time of close. Maybe curious kind of is one of potentially other expansions that it could occur. And then maybe if there’s anything on the scale and timing of that project that you didn’t already mention. Alan Armstrong: Mike, do you want to take that? Michael Dunn: Yes. Tristan that was not in our pro forma economics for the acquisition. So it’s certainly a pleasant upside there with the MountainWest acquisition. This is about an 11% increase in the Overthrust capacity for the 325,000 dekatherms a day expansion. And it’s a pretty simple expansion. It is two compressors that we’re adding at existing compression facilities on that system, but there’s definitely more upside opportunity there. There seems to be a desire to get more gas Westbound toward the Opal pricing point. That’s been a pretty solid pricing point for a number of years now. And even this summer, we’ve seen gas trading at $4 there at the Opal hub, even higher than that, just driven by California economics with the heat that hits California this summer and gas generation that’s picking up there. So I would expect to see a lot of desire for customers to get to that Opal pricing point. And that certainly bodes well for Overthrust at the direct connection into that hub. And as far as the rest of the MountainWest system, we see a lot of opportunity there for coal to gas switching. There’s a number of very large coal-fired power plants in Wyoming and Utah that do have opportunities for conversion to natural gas. And some of those we’ve already acquired and we’re actually building expansions for off the Overthrust system today in Bridger Units 1 and 2 in Wyoming on the [indiscernible] system are converting to gas. And we’re building a pipeline over to the – that facility this year. So we’ll continue to see opportunities like that on the MountainWest system and those are certainly upside opportunities, not only for us, but gas will be sourced out of the Wamsutter field with our Upstream production and we’re driving that gas to those markets as well with the secret platform. Tristan Richardson: That’s great. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mike. Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Gabriel Moreen at Mizuho. Gabriel Moreen: Hey, good morning, everyone. It looks like you had a lot of E&amp;P hedges since your last update in 1Q. I was just wondering if you can not to beat a dead horse on 2023 guidance, which I know I’m doing, but just what the exposure is at this point on the E&amp;P side, and then also as you think about hedging 2024 for on the E&amp;P side, which what you’re thinking, and maybe in light of also potentially doing some transactions around E&amp;P with the gas curve having creeped up a little bit here. Alan Armstrong: Yes John, you want to take the first part of that and I’ll take the last? John Porter: Yes. Absolutely. We have continued to add hedges on the expected Upstream JV production. We generally don’t go too far in hedging. We like to have a comfortable spread between what’s hedged and what’s not hedged, just to account for the potential for any kind of production offset. So there is a fairly significant portion that that remains unhedged. We do provide in our materials all of the current hedges that we have outstanding against the Upstream business and that’s in the appendix. Alan Armstrong: Yes. And Gabe, I would just add to that, I think in terms of our approach to hedging on the E&amp;P side, we have been putting on some April through October hedges for gas in 2024. And as John said, large – so part of that’s driven by the fact that we don’t really want to get caught short in an up market. I think everybody experienced that a couple of years ago. And so we tend to not get ourselves in a position where we could get caught short on production, particularly since we don’t operate that production. So that’s how we think about hedging on the E&amp;P side there. So – but in terms of the – in the broader scheme of things, in terms of transactions around E&amp;P, I would just say we continue to entertain a lot of interest in that. And I would just say I – as we look at the landscape and the demand that’s building for not just – everybody’s very focused on LNG and we think obviously that’s going to continue to be a big driver for demand, but the macro picture we’re seeing around electrification and the amount of power demand increase that continues to build in this country is pretty impressive. And we’re also seeing a lot of industrial demand pick up in and around our assets as well, and things that were previously powered by either fuel oil or coal or onshoring ammonia production here in the U.S. there’s just a lot of demand building and we have a pretty good insight to that. So it’s kind of seems shortsighted to get in a hurry to sell out particularly at like the Haynesville where the team, the GeoSouthern team has done a great job there and they continue to find ways to lower cost and increase production there.So we think both from their operational capabilities, which we’re enjoying and the macro fundamentals around gas is just not really a compelling reason to liquidate in this environment. Gabriel Moreen: Thanks, Alan. And then maybe if I can just ask a follow-up on the ERP spend at Transco, and I recognize it’s – Transco’s got an awfully big rate base to it, but as you think about having to file the rate case at Transco and its upcoming, how do you think about ERP spend within that context? Does it matter at all with the rate case coming up as far as accelerating it or refraining from doing that? Michael Dunn: Hey Gabe, it’s Michael. Yes. We just put in service at Station 180 replacement. We’ve replaced 14 units there with two new state-of-the-art turbines, and we’ve got three more stations that will be very similar fashion coming on before the test period closes on the rate case. And so that’s the anticipated bin curve there, similar to what we did on 180. And its really highly dependent after that on the rate case outcome and whether we get an emissions tracker, which we would certainly hope to achieve on the Transco rate case, similar to what we were able to do on Northwest Pipeline. And that would really drive our decision making in the near-term on spending beyond the 2024, 2025 timeframe. And we layer that into what our next rate case tranche looks like on the Transco system and really try to balance that spending curve where we think those rate cases are going to line out there in the future. But obviously hoping to go into this one with an emissions tracker, modernization type tracker coming out of the negotiated settlement that we hope to achieve with the Transco customers and we’ll see how that turns out. Gabriel Moreen: Got it. Thanks, Michael. Operator: We’ll go next now to Neal Dingmann at Truist. Jake Nivasch: Hi, this is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Just a quick one on cap allocation. I think you guys might have covered it, but I just want to make sure that I heard it correctly. Just in regards to distribution growth, I mean, you guys are pretty well covered even after that 5% boost this year. Are you looking – and you might have covered this already, but are you looking to accelerate that at some point in the near-term? Or just curious how you guys are thinking about that? Alan Armstrong: Yes, really good question. I would say that we’ve said all along that we expect this business to generate in the 5% to 7% growth on EBITDA and that we would expect that to keep our dividend somewhat in line with that. And so I think as we think about it forward AFFO per share really is the number I think to keep your eye on that’ll drive our decisions on dividend looking forward. And so I think that’s a really good number for you to focus on. But yes, we certainly have plenty of room, plenty of capacity and in terms of that dividend increase, and it’s just going to be driven by what we’re seeing as a kind of a long-term sustainable AFFO per share is really what’s going to drive our dividend decisions. Jake Nivasch: Got you. Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you. Alan Armstrong: Thank you. Operator: And we’ll go next now to Robert Catellier at CIBC Capital Markets. Robert Catellier: Hi, Rob Catellier, I just wanted to follow-up on capital allocation this time on M&amp;A. So understanding that you’ve been quite active in the last 18 months or so. Can you comment on the company’s appetite for additional acquisitions and maybe on the state of the M&amp;A market understanding that maybe MountainWest was a little unique. So just how the low commodity prices and higher interest rates are impacting bid of spreads? Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would say that that’s not completely clear to us yet. It’s a good question and you would think it would ultimately have some impact, particularly people that are exposed to floating rates that, that, that certainly would drive some transactions. But I would say we haven’t seen great evidence of that occurring just yet. And I would just say we’re going to be like we have been hanging around the hoop looking for things where we have a unique competitive advantage that drives really strong accretion and value to our shareholders. And so far that patience has paid off really well for us. And I don’t see any reason we would change that patience to keep kind of looking for those things that are very unique and that we have a unique competitive advantage on. And so that’s what I would tell you to expect more of, but I’m not sure that, that I yet see the market being flooded or depressed with assets yet from people that might be sitting on floating rate capitalization. So we’re very fortunate where we stand from both a debt capacity and an interest rate standpoint without floating rate exposure. So we’re really excited about where we stand, but there may be some businesses and assets that get a little bit damaged and have to look for transactions to solve their problems, but that’s not evident to us just yet. Robert Catellier: Okay. That was the color I was looking for. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. We do have no further questions this morning. Mr. Armstrong, I’d like to turn things back to you for closing comments. Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thank you all for the great questions this morning. Thank you for your continued interest in the company and we just want to reiterate how excited we are about our continued growth on top of growth here in the business and our abilities to demonstrate our resilience this quarter and we appreciate your confidence in our company. Thank you. Operator: Thank you again. Ladies and gentlemen, I will conclude The Williams second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I’d like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great day. Goodbye.]"

Investors who have traded the inverse of the commentator's recommendations have enjoyed a return of up to 22% over the past year. Some of the stocks that have generated significant returns in the inverse Cramer strategy include C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).However, Cramer has been right in his calls on several occasions. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of his top picks for the year. The stock has gone on to gain more than 40% year to date on benefiting from the tech bull rally.Cramer has also been bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a stock that has taken the market by storm, tripling in value and becoming a trillion-dollar company. Other top performers in his portfolio include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which have posted more than 40% yearly gains.Cramer also has an edge in calling out big winners outside tech. Some of his little-known gems that have rallied to 52-weeks highs and generated significant returns include Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI), Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A).Story continues11 Jim Cramer Stock Picks this WeekCramer recently warned of the need to be extremely cautious on stocks that continue to rally on the back of no solid underlying fundamentals in what he deems a frothy situation.The CNBC commentator is also staying clear of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), insisting that the drug maker faces increased competition and regulatory pressure for its lead products such as Keytruda. Cramer's Trust has also exited its position on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on concerns about the legal issues that the company faces with its baby powder and talc products. The analyst is also downbeat about Verizon and sees little growth.Our methodologyWe have compiled a list of stocks Jim Cramer believes have a significant upside potential compared to their peers. The stocks were picked from the CNBC commentator's recent shows on Mad Money, where he interacts with callers providing insights on how he believes different stocks will perform. We ranked the stocks based on the upside potential which was calculated on the basis of average analyst price estimates for these stocks.11. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Upside Potential: 8.89% Price target: $92.44According to Cramer, PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) is a great American company for anyone looking for some exposure in the auto industry. The stock has already rallied to its 52-week high after gaining more than 35% year to date.The rally comes at the back of an impressive record of positive earnings surprises.

Wall Street is overly optimistic about Paccar with Ana's verge price target of $92.44, which implies an 8.89% upside potential.10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Upside Potential: 8.88% Price target: $75.22According to Cramer, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a worthy stock to own for gaining some exposure in the burgeoning semiconductor sector. With the company looking to push the envelope in the AI memory market with its product development, it boasts tremendous potentialAccording to Cramer, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is well-positioned to benefit from the global chip shortage as it has a significant supply that meets demand from various sectors, including gaming, computing, and smartphones.In addition, the CNBC commentator believes the chip giant is trading at a cheap valuation compared to its peers, thus, well poised to benefit amid the AI fueled rally.According to the analyst, buying Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) on weakness would be an ideal play. The stock commands a $75.22 average price target implying an 8.88% upside potential.9. U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)Upside Potential: 8.94% Price target: $64U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) has outperformed the market in 2023 despite being a seasonal stock over the years. The stock is already up by more than 30% for the year, and Cramer believes it still has significant upside potential.There were concerns that U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)'s core business of renting trucks, trailers portable moving storage units would be hurt by more people opting to remodel houses instead of moving. However, that has yet to be the case.The storied do-it-yourself specialist benefits from moving activity bouncing back to historic trends.According to Cramer, U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) is an inexpensive stock that should continue increasing.

The sell-off came amid concerns that the bank's depositors were fleeing.Fast forward, the bank's genuine deposits grew significantly in the second quarter, shrugging any concerns of a bank run. According to Cramer, the 50% run from 2023 lows is justified, and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) is well poised to continue edging higher, considering it is still down from its highs. Wall Street expects the stock to rally by 10%, going by the $57.55 average price target.7. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Upside Potential: 12.94% Price target: $70.42Marvell Technology, Inc.

Never miss another market-moving alert.Amazon smashes Q2 estimatesAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) surged 8% Friday after the tech giant blew Q2 estimates out of the water and nicely topped guidance revenue, riding high off strength in its cloud business.Amazon said its profit came to $0.65 for the quarter - $0.30 better than the consensus of $0.35 - on revenue of $134.4 billion, which also surpassed the $131.45B average analyst estimate.Amazon Web Services, which comprised 70% of its Q2 operating profit, jumped 12% to $22.1B - ahead of estimates for 10.2% growth. The company said this surge came as customers ""started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment.""For the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $138B to $143B vs. estimates for $138.28B.Bernstein called the print ""a defining moment"" during CEO Andy Jassy's tenure, which started about two years ago, and hiked the company's price target by $20 to $175 per share. Bernstein added:Amazon fired on all cylinders: AWS finally stabilizing and now a coiled spring; Retail performance hanging in with a weakened consumer; N. American retail margins are back to pre-pandemic levels and accelerating alongside compressing fulfillment windows — impressive; and aggregate operating profits are up and to the right.BofA said Amazon remains ""our top stock in sector"" given Amazon's retail cost improvement efforts, saying it expects ""several more quarters of margin benefits from increasing retail efficiency."" BofA added that AWS is ""seemingly poised to accelerate"" given the ""end of Cloud spending optimization cycle amidst easing comps.""Story continuesBarclays concurred, writing that AWS is ""likely re-accelerating on regular/AI workloads,"" adding that ""retail growth is steady and margins may overshoot the 2018 peak.""""It's finally time to sit back and enjoy the ride,"" Barclays wrote.Shares booked a weekly gain of 4.8% gain to $139.57Apple slumps on iPhone worriesApple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 4.8% Friday after the iPhone maker reported its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, even though fiscal third-quarter results topped estimates.iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of Apple's total top line, fell to $39.67 billion from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B. And revenue overall totaled $81.8B - better than the $81.73 consensus, but down from $83B a year earlier.Strength in Apple's services business helped offset the soft iPhone sales: Revenue from Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other service units, grew to $21.21B from $19.60B a year earlier, ahead of estimates of $20.76B.As for its bottom line, earnings per share came to $1.26, also topping estimates for $1.19.Regarding the iPhone softness, in the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects iPhone and services performance to ""accelerate from the June quarter"" year over year. He also predicted more double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales, ""particularly on the Mac,"" due to difficult comparisons vs. the prior year.In fiscal Q3, iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3. missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B.Still, given the expected acceleration in iPhone sales and services, as well as the gross margin expansion, Citi opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on AAPL stock.""Post Jun-Q earnings through new Phone launch the stock historically outperformed NASDAQ 5 out 7 times and S&amp;P500 all 7 times, or 8% on average since 2016,"" Citi wrote in a note.On the other hand, BofA remains sidelined:We remain Neutral as positive catalysts of new product introduction and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment. ...The guidance suggests typical launch timing for iPhones but with the backdrop of a weak US smartphone market we think it’s unlikely that iPhone rev significantly re-accelerates.Shares ended the week down 7.2% to $181.99.AMD sees a roller coaster week after Q2Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares took a slide on its Q2 results amid analyst concerns about guidance, but the stock strongly recovered after Morgan Stanley said the selloff was overdone.AMD's Q2 EPS came in at $0.58 per share, a penny better than consensus, and Q3 guidance also topped consensus - but Bernstein said it fears estimates ""remain too high"" amid optimism around AI ""and the stock... looks a little stretched to us,"" according to Reuters.Oppenheimer was also cautious, writing, ""We remain sidelined as AMD’s AI strategy proves out.""Revenue totaled $5.4B, better than the $5.32B analyst expectations, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company's AI engagements climbed by more than seven times ""as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale.""The stock more than recovered, ending with a 1.6% gain for the week to $115.82, after Morgan Stanley said it sees the stock as a ""significant outperformer"" relative to other chip stocks at current levels. The analyst added:Guidance for flat y/y servers in 3q - up 15-20% q/q - with clear eyes about the current cloud weakness should be an indication that share gains and the delayed Genoa ramp are in good shape. We expected the stock to be up meaningfully.Citi, for its part, upgraded AMD to Buy from Neutral immediately after the Q2 results, bumping its price target by $16 to $136 per share.""We thought AMD’s AI products (MI300) would be margin dilutive and investors would eventually care about the expensive valuation on AMD, and we were wrong on both counts,"" the analysts said.Qualcomm falls on soft guidanceQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) fell more than 8% Thursday after the company reported underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and delivered mixed fiscal Q3 results amid softer smartphone demand.The chipmaker reported adjusted EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $8.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.81 on revenue of $8.51B.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided EPS in the range of $1.80 to $2 - the midpoint of which is below Wall Street estimates for $1.94 - on revenue of between $8.1B to $8.9B, which compares with estimates for $8.77B.""The midpoint of our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 guidance includes the continued impact of the macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and channel inventory drawdown,"" the company said.Deutsche Bank downgraded the QCOM stock to Hold with a price target lowered by $10 to $120 per share. While the company was in line with the analysts' estimates, it was concerned with management's ""soft commentary"" around its December quarter and ""incremental headwinds in 2024.""CFRA, meanwhile, lifted the price target by $2 to $125 per share on the Hold-rated QCOM stock. The firm wrote:Although we expect QCOM's under-shipping of true demand is likely to come to an end over the next 3-6 months, we remain wary of QCOM to potentially start losing Apple business by late CY 24.Qualcomm shares partially recovered on Friday, but ended the week with a 6.4% loss to $121.50.PayPal plummets on gross profit worriesPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) plunged more than 12% Thursday, after edging out Q2 top- and bottom-line estimates, on worries regarding its gross profit growth.PayPal said it earned $1.16 per share in Q2 on revenue of $7.29 billion. Analysts polled by InvestingPro anticipated EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $7.27B.But the company's total payment volume (TPV), or transaction revenue less transaction expenses and transaction losses, rose just 1% from the prior year.After the print, Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to In Line from Outperform, saying it sees ""increasing headwinds to revenue and earnings growth"" due to ""intensifying competition, evidenced by the sequential loss of 2.5 million consumer accounts (0.6% of total accounts) combined with nearly 300 basis point of transaction margin pressure.""The analyst added: ""Without a clear path to year-over-year transaction margin expansion, we see limited scope for earnings outperformance.""Bernstein also voiced concerns about TPV growth pressures, adding that gross profit (GP) growth ""is essentially the true revenue for the company."" The analyst added:Transaction GP is a critical health metric, especially because TPV growth is an outcome of many businesses with vastly different gross margins. ... On surface, transaction GP growth looks very weak. Are the gross margin pressures structural or transitory?In terms of guidance, PayPal expects Q3 adjusted EPS to grow 13% to 14%, to a range of $1.22 to $1.24, on 8% revenue growth to about $7.4B. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS and revenue of $1.22 and $7.33B, respectively.For all of 2023, EPS is expected at $4.95, just above expectations of $4.94.Shares ultimately lost more than 16% for the week to $62.75.Yasin Ebrahim, Senad Karaahmetovic, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.***Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Vice President and Acting CFO. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch: Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal's earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2023. Joining me today on the call is Dan Schulman, our President and CEO. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website. In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. We will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties.Paypal PYPL Mastercard MA Visawww.BillionPhotos.com / Shutterstock.com These statements include, without limitation, our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023 are planning assumptions for 2023.

Our actual results may differ materially from these statements.

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, August 2, 2023. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Daniel Schulman: Thanks, Gabe, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. I'm proud of the PayPal team as we delivered another solid quarter. Revenues came in above the top end of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS grew 24% to $1.16 in line with the midpoint of our guide. And we are reiterating our guidance for non-GAAP EPS and operating margin expansion for the full year. Encouragingly, e-commerce growth appears to have stabilized in the mid-single digits, substantially above our estimates when we entered 2023. Our branded checkout volumes grew roughly in line with the industry in Q2 and accelerated to nearly 6.5% growth in the month of June, and in July, our branded checkout volume growth accelerated again to over 8%, our highest monthly growth rate since the end of the pandemic. We expect branded checkout volumes will strengthen throughout the back half of the year, supported by traction from our key strategic initiatives. Of course, we still face a fluid global macroeconomic environment. However, it is quite encouraging to see core inflation rates continue to come down. As inflation cools, we would expect to see discretionary spending rise, which we believe will support and possibly accelerate the overall growth of e-commerce spending. And as the market leader in digital payments, any uptick in e-commerce will accelerate our growth. Revenues in Q2 grew by 8% on a currency-neutral basis to approximately $7.3 billion. It's instructive to note that we are lapping certain items that provided an outsized benefit to us in Q2 and Q3 last year. Consequently, those items pressure our revenue growth rate by approximately 1.25% in each of those quarters this year. Excluding these items, our growth in Q2 would have been between 9% and 10%. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect our revenue growth in the second half of the year to be roughly the same as and given recent trends, maybe a bit better than the first half. We expect Q3 revenues to grow approximately 8% on a currency-neutral basis. I would highlight that July was a very strong start to the quarter with currency-neutral revenue growth of 9% and TPV growth accelerating into the low teens. And for the year, we anticipate our revenue growth to be between 9% and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. We continue to exercise good discipline in managing operating expenses. For the quarter, non-GAAP nontransaction-related expenses fell 11% year-over-year. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin was 21.4%, up approximately 230 basis points from a year ago. We expect to increase our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year by at least 100 basis points. As we look ahead to the rest of 2023 and into 2024, we expect to drive meaningful productivity improvements. Our initial experiences with AI and continuing advances in our processes, infrastructure and product quality, enable us to see a future where we do things better, faster and cheaper. These overall cost savings come even as we significantly invest against our three strategic priorities. We know exactly what we need to do as we look towards 2024. And as you can see in our results, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. We understand that over the medium to long term, we need to deliver growth in our transaction margin dollars to ensure we sustainably grow our earnings. And we are beginning to see clear signs that our initiatives will yield notable traction against that objective over the next several quarters. As I mentioned, we expect our top line to accelerate to low double-digit growth by Q4. We expect transaction margin dollars to increase while our operating expenses continue to create significant leverage. That in connection with our share buybacks enables us to target low to mid-teens EPS growth for the remainder of 2023, even as we begin to lap the increases we enjoyed on our interest income. I'd like to now turn to our three strategic priorities in which we are investing our resources and energy, branded checkout, our PSC merchant solutions and our digital wallets. As I've mentioned in the past, all three of these are critical and interrelated. They are essential for us to increase our share of the e-commerce market as well as accelerate our margin dollar growth. As we discussed in our June investor meeting, we are meaningfully accelerating new product innovations into the market, scaling our A/B testing and significantly improving our time to market. We are now consistently delivering against our road map on schedule. This is the result of significant investments in our platform infrastructure and tools and enhanced set of measurements and performance indicators, hiring new talent and early successes using AI in our software development process. We continue to ramp our test velocity with more than 300 experiments launched across our product experience in the first half of the year. Every successful test leads to incremental customer benefits and the cumulative effect of those changes leads to noticeable improvements in our key metrics, including the gains we are seeing in branded checkout growth. For instance, our buy now, pay later traction has meaningfully accelerated with the introduction of preapproved amounts to our consumers. Our work in onboarding and onboarding new experiences has driven new monthly cohorts with higher engagement and lifetime value. In this month, we are expanding the rollout of Paske [ph] in the U.S. and Europe, which will greatly simplify the branded checkout log-in experience and drive improved authorization rates that will further extend our lead over our competitors. Our goal is to continually close the gap in our log-in and checkout experiences every quarter and to be equal to or better than any competitor within the next year. We simultaneously aim to drive differentiated wallet experiences across both PayPal and Venmo. We believe that only those companies with unique and scaled data sets, we'll be able to fully utilize the power of AI to drive actionable insights and differentiated value propositions for their customers. We are already experimenting internally with an AI-driven PayPal assistant. We envision that a version of this will be part of our consumer app, and we plan to introduce it later this year. We continue to see impressive traction in our PSP business with our growth rates nearly 30% on a currency-neutral basis. Many of the largest tech companies in the world are now either using our Braintree capabilities or are in deep strategic negotiations with us to do so. We are in the process of rolling out high-margin, value-added services, expanding internationally and making noticeable progress with in-person payments. And we continue to receive exceptional interest in our next-generation checkout solution, which will leverage the scale of our network Vault, our deep understanding of our two-sided network and the development of proprietary AI models. I couldn't be more pleased with the initial rollout of PayPal Complete payments. Our PSP merchant solution for channel partners and the SMB market. We are seeing tremendous interest in the platform with a substantial pipeline of completed sales and a backlog of deals that continues to grow. Importantly, our major channel partners are enthusiastic about its capabilities. We have already implemented PPCP, with leading channel partners like Adobe, LightSpeed, Recurly, Shift4, Shopify, Stacks Payments, UltraCare, Wix and WooCommerce with more than 25 additional channel partners scheduled to be live by the end of the year. This not only demonstrates the strength of our platform capabilities but will also enable a meaningful number of SMB merchants to access our latest checkout experiences. There is a remarkable sense of energy, excitement and enthusiasm among our leadership teams as we see clear and distinct signs of reinvigorated success in the market. We are now able to take advantage of many of the investments we have made over the past years to deliver a best-in-class experience for our customers, leveraging a modern infrastructure and our scale in the age of AI. We have successfully recruited a large number of external talent to complement our internal teams in both AI and machine learning as well as throughout our product, engineering and technology groups in order to build upon our success and maximize our opportunity. I'd like to end my remarks talking about our CEO succession plan. We are in the very final stages of the process. with several outstanding candidates, all of whom are highly qualified and excited to lead PayPal as we go into our next chapter of growth. I'm eager to welcome PayPal's next CEO to work with them on a seamless onboarding and to support them in the amazing PayPal team as I transition to my role on the Board. As you can hopefully tell, we have a lot of energy and confidence that we are on the right path with good momentum. Many of the headwinds we faced are now turning into tailwinds. We are executing with a high degree of excellence. We have a firm handle on our business model and can point to numerous successes already making a real difference in the market, which will only continue to compound over time. PayPal is in an increasingly strong position, and we are poised to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you. And with that, let me turn the call over to Gab. Gabrielle Rabinovitch: Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serving our customers and executing our priorities. PayPal delivered another solid quarter in a dynamic environment. We're reporting revenue at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share consistent with our expectations. Our results are tracking with the guidance we gave for the full year and reflect steady progress against our long-term growth aspirations. We continue to invest in our key initiatives, while demonstrating discipline in delivering on our operating expense commitments. In June, we were delighted to share more about our long-term strategic plan and product road maps at our investment community meeting. Importantly, the product launches we discussed are on track, and we continue to gain conviction in our ability to accelerate our branded checkout volumes and drive greater profitability across our PSP services. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce a multiyear agreement to sell both our existing European Buy now Pay Later receivables as well as future originations to KKR. During my remarks, I will discuss the impact of this externalization on our financial results. We have also included additional details in our investor update presentation. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our second quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis and 7% at spot to $7.3 billion. Transaction revenue grew 5% to $6.6 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and PayPal branded checkout. Headwinds to growth in the quarter included the lapping of $75 million in contractual compensation from merchants last year, which was de minimis this year, $72 million less in hedge gains relative to Q2 last year and the impact from migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services. Other value-added services revenue grew 37% to $731 million. This performance was predominantly due to increased interest income on customer store balances and to a lesser extent, revenue growth from consumer credit products. In the second quarter, U.S. revenue grew 9% and international revenue increased 5%. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenue increased 7%, accelerating sequentially and year-over-year. Transaction take rate declined 11 basis points to 1.74%. Approximately two thirds of this decline was driven by a decline in foreign exchange fees, in part driven by lower currency volatility, a decline in gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue and the headwind from lapping elevated contractual assessments from merchants last year. While merchant mix continued to pressure our branded checkout take rate, the second quarter was an improvement from Q1. Our total take rate declined 6 basis points to 1.94%, affected by the same factors as transaction take rate. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 94 basis points, 4 basis points higher than Q2 last year. This increase was primarily driven by growth in Braintree volumes, partially offset by rate benefits in core PayPal and Venmo. Overall, transaction expense dollars grew 16%. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 8 basis points for the quarter, a 3.6 basis point improvement versus last year. Transaction loss dollars declined 25%. The decrease this year was primarily due to an atypical merchandise solvency last year, which drove a sizable loss in the second quarter with no comparable exposure this year. Our ongoing risk mitigation activities and mix of volumes also contributed to this performance. Credit losses were $112 million or 3 basis points of the rate of TPV. On a dollar basis, credit losses increased 65%. Provisions in the quarter were driven by a build of $146 million, partially offset by a $33 million reserve release from the reclassification of our European Buy now Pay Later portfolio to held for sale from held for investment. The operating income benefit from this release of reserves was entirely offset by the fair value discount on the portfolio classified as held for sale. The increased provisioning resulted from increased expected losses in our PayPal business loans portfolio as well as growth in our U.S. Paylater portfolio. Like the broader industry, we're seeing a normalization of our credit portfolio to pre – COVID delinquency levels across our consumer and PayPal working capital portfolio. That said, we have seen some deterioration in our business loans portfolio. This portfolio represents less than 15% of our overall net credit receivables. And as we discussed last quarter, we have taken remedial actions to address this performance. We've tightened originations and have already seen improvement in new cohorts. We'll be managing the book with similar rigor as we move through the remainder of the year. As a result of designating $1.9 billion in pay later receivables to assets held for sale, we ended Q2 with $5.5 billion in net credit receivables, a 3.5% decline year-over-year and a 26% decline sequentially. The decline in receivables due to held for sale accounting also contributed to an increase in our reserve coverage ratio. This ratio increased to 10% from 7.8% in Q1. In the aggregate, volume-based expenses increased 13% in Q2 relative to an increase of 30% in the second quarter of 2022. Transaction margin dollars grew 1% to $3.3 billion, and transaction margin was 45.9%. While our transaction margin declined in the quarter, the rate of decline slowed considerably from both Q1 and the second quarter of last year, and we're executing on our strategy to grow transaction margin dollars. We're encouraged by the progress we're making against our longer-term initiatives that will support improved transaction margin performance over time. Q2 marked the third quarter in a row that we've delivered meaningful expansion in our operating margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Ongoing discipline in managing our cost structure allowed us to more than offset transaction margin compression with operating expense leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, nontransaction-related operating expenses declined 11%, with reductions across each of our principal operating expense categories contributing significant leverage. Strong expense performance resulted in 20% growth in non-GAAP operating income to $1.6 billion. This is the highest growth in operating income that we've delivered in more than 2 years. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 228 basis points to 21.4%, which was slightly below the guidance we gave for the quarter. This is principally attributable to our credit portfolio, where we earned less revenue than expected and increased loss provisions. For the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased 24% to $1.16, which was the midpoint of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $14.4 billion. The net cash outflows for originations of loans held for sale reduced cash flows from operations by $1.2 billion in the quarter, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of negative $350 million. Later this year, when the sale of the European BNPL back book closes, the proceeds will be recognized in cash flows from operations and offset this decline. So while the timing of accounting treatment will affect the quarterly profile of our free cash flow, there is no change to our outlook for the year, and we continue to expect to generate approximately $5 billion in free cash flow. In the quarter, we completed $1.5 million in share repurchases. For the full year, we now expect to allocate approximately $5 billion to our buyback program. Our recently announced credit externalization will help optimize our balance sheet and improve our capital efficiency. Given our desire to return capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our business, we've taken a more aggressive approach to share repurchases. Since the end of 2021, our diluted share count has declined 6%. I would now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As Dan shared, based on our results from the first half of the year, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year for non-GAAP operating margin expansion and earnings per share. In the aggregate, for the first and second quarters of 2023, we've delivered revenue growth of approximately 9% on a currency-neutral basis. We expect revenue growth in the back half of the year to be in line with this performance, if not slightly ahead, given the momentum we're seeing in the business. In addition, we're on track to meet our expense guidance for the year and are committed to delivering at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We also continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $4.95, representing 20% growth from 2022. We're reiterating our full year guidance while absorbing incremental pressure from our credit portfolio, given strengthening business performance driven by checkout initiatives and our ongoing realization of productivity gains. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 8% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to approximately $7.4 billion at current spot rates. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.24, representing growth of approximately 13.5% at the midpoint of the range. In summary, we're proud of our solid operating results this quarter. PayPal's unique competitive advantages, including our portfolio of differentiated assets and our global scale and ubiquity continue to drive us forward. We're committed to investing in our core strengths and building PayPal for the future, and we're guided by our relentless focus on creating the best possible experiences for our customers. Our revenue momentum and customer engagement trends position us well to achieve our growth objectives this year and beyond. Given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on managing the things we can control and allocating capital with discipline to ensure we optimize for long-term value creation and resiliency. And with that, Dan and I are happy to take your questions. Sarah, please go ahead. See also 10 Stocks That Will Go Up 1000 Percent and Top 20 Smart Cities in the World.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of . Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks a lot. I want to ask a question on e-commerce Health. And Dan, I know you talked about it upfront. We're just getting a lot of questions on the e-commerce industry in general. So you mentioned inflation easing should help. I'm curious about other trends like shift from services to goods like our economists are talking about, which I think would also be a tailwind for you versus an previously. Is this something you're seeing? Or maybe is that changing how you're thinking about the second half versus a quarter ago? It seems like there's some room for upsetting your outlook here given the exit growth rate and what you talked about for July? Thanks. Daniel Schulman: Tien-Tsin: E-commerce is definitely one of those. We see e-commerce growth accelerating. We think it is at least in the mid-single digits right now. That's substantially above what we thought when we entered the year where we thought it might be flat year-over-year. And I would say I've got a slight bias that, that will continue to accelerate. You've got a range out there from low of zero to high 10%. We think it's probably right in the middle of that, and we think it is being driven by a shift from travel and services into goods and to fashion, where coming into retail pieces of that. And clearly, as inflation cools, we would expect to see more discretionary spend rebound, and that will help drive e-commerce. So one of the headwinds we faced was e-commerce growth slowing. Now it's accelerating again, and that clearly will be meaningful for us. We're also seeing improvements, as Gabi mentioned, in cross-border. That's beginning to accelerate again. That's obviously a very meaningful thing for us because, one, our value proposition is perfect for cross-border. It's consumers buying from merchants that they don't really know, but they trust PayPal and make sure that, that payment will be protected for them. It's obviously extremely high-margin business for us, and that seems to be accelerating nicely right now. PPCP, which was a really important introduction for us for numerous reasons, could not have a better reception in the market. We've got tremendous momentum there. Braintree continues to go from strength to strength, and we're seeing a lot of our value-added services now start to take hold. I can talk about some of that later in the call. Somebody wants to ask about that. And obviously, branded checkout is accelerating. That 8% is the highest we've seen since the end of the pandemic. And -- we continue to expect to see that strengthen as we go through the year as many of our initiatives are really taking hold in the last quarter. We've got another 200-plus experiments that are going to happen in Q3. And so that's all adding to momentum. And I guess at the end of the day, what that's adding up to when we look at our Net Promoter Score, we're now at a 7-year high in that. And so there's clearly a lot of momentum in the business right now, and we just want to double down on that. So we do obviously feel a lot better today than we did 90 days ago. But I think that's just going to continue when you ask that same question a quarter from now. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Darrin Peller: Hey, Thanks, guys. Revenue growth was obviously sound, but we still saw transaction profit dollars a little less pronounced versus revenue. I think it actually may have decreased a bit year-over-year. And so Gabriel, I know you talked about some one-time grow-overs and hedging differences. And I'm sure the mix between branded and branded continues to have an impact given the growth of Greentree. But if you could just help us understand the moving parts in the quarter and the trends in the second half as far as gross profit or transaction profit growth goes, that would be great. Gabrielle Rabinovitch: You bet. You bet, For the quarter, transaction margin dollars grew 1%, which is essentially in line with Q1. That said, when we look at the underlying performance of our business, we're very encouraged by the stronger results we're seeing. In my prepared remarks, I called out several items that created headwinds to growth in the quarter due to lapping. In addition, we actually had some benefits that we saw in the quarter as well from the release of reserves from held for sale reclassification as well as from lapping that large merchant exposure last year. And so when we adjust for all these items, both the benefits and the drag on a more normalized basis, we actually see transaction margin dollars in the quarter growing several points faster than the reported 1%.And what we're really encouraged by is the strengthening profile of the business. We're actually starting to see the benefits of our initiatives as we get through some of the noise from lapping, we do expect to see improving transaction profit growth. When we think about the back half in Q3, we'll still see some pressure on transaction margin performance. In Q4, we expect to see an improvement. And then over the longer term, our TM profile in the future will certainly be benefited by the acceleration in branded checkout by e-commerce acceleration by the improved cross-border trends that Dan referred to as well as from the value-added services that we're adding on the PSP side. Darrin Peller: That's really helpful. So it sounds like some of these initiatives are third, fourth quarter events, but they could move needle starting them. Gabrielle Rabinovitch: We expect to exit the year in a much stronger position from a TM trajectory than where we are right now. Darrin Peller: Okay. Very good. Thanks. Guys. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette: I wanted to follow up on Darrin's question. I know that unbranded seems to be a drag or dilutive to margins right now overall, which is a little bit surprising given just kind of how margin structure tends to be throughout the industry. I know you've talked a little bit in the past about adding incremental services to unbranded that could improve that structural margin component in on branded. Can you talk a little bit about what that may look like, timing and if any of those initiatives are will play a role in improving the transaction margin that you're looking at for the latter part of this year? Thanks. Gabrielle Rabinovitch: Yes. I'll take a crack at that, James. Thanks for the question. Our PSP business does continue to go from strength to strength. -- as we talked about our overall TPV was nearly 30% in the quarter. And that's despite, as Gabriel mentioned, deprecating some of our older PSP flows, things coming off of our PayPal Pro. We actually migrated about $5 billion of TPV from our legacy stacks onto PPCP in this past quarter. And so it's a bit of a drag in the quarter, but we're going to be done with that by the end of the year. And we continue to win marquee accounts in the business, whether that be booking.com, meta, Allstate insurance, these are big accounts that we are winning because winning PSP is a strategic imperative for us. It allows us to have our latest checkout experiences with the largest, most important merchants in the world across PayPal, Venmo and by now pay later. We captured 100% of the data flows, which really is feeding our AI engines. It's fueling what will be our next-generation checkout. And most importantly, it's fueling kind of our ability to have best-in-class authorities in the industry and the lowest loss rates in the industry. In terms of the higher-margin services that we're going to be putting out there, -- we are seeing a lot of traction on that right now. For instance, we are moving into in-store. That's always been an area of opportunity for us. We are now fully implemented with 20 marquee merchants in over 1,000 in-store locations, over 2,500 POS systems will continue to do quite well there and push significantly in that. We're making good progress in selling things like payouts, risk-as-a-service, disputes, automation. We're seeing our largest customers begin to adopt that right now, whether it be Chen or meta or Tiktok, really, these are some of the bigger clients that we have adopting our value-added services -- and I'll just give you one example. We just started doing orchestration in 6 additional LatAm countries with much higher margins and where we're doing that orchestration for our largest customers, we're seeing like a 190 basis point off rate improvement. So you're seeing kind of this win-win as we're doing this. And then, of course, PPCP, as it goes down market is a much higher margin product for us. Yes, I talked about all of the channel partners that have already implemented that or in the middle of implementing, and we've got another 25 more partners by year-end in the U.S. another 15 EU partners by year-end. So we're seeing a tremendous amount of scaling on that. We've also enabled here in the U.S. 1.2 million SMB merchants to basically do a one-click migration into PPCP, -- we've already done all the risk assessment for them. They're on the right platforms for us to be able to seamlessly transition them onto that platform. So I think we're going to see a large amount of volume moving into PPP. That's obviously higher margin, high value-added services on branching will also help. And those will develop over time. Clearly, every quarter, they will add and some cumulative total will start to feel as we kind of exit the year and certainly as we go into 2024 with that. I hope that helped... James Faucette: Thanks. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.Ramsey El Assal: In terms of operating margin performance, were there any factors besides credit that had a bigger impact than you expected in Q2? And then separately, can you just talk about the overall health of the credit business? Give us more color on the steps you're taking to maybe manage it a little bit differently. It sounded like that was the plan. Gabrielle Rabinovitch: Absolutely. So for the quarter, we expanded our operating margin by about 228 basis points to 21.4%. This was a slight miss to our guidance of approximately 22%, and it was predominantly driven by increased pressure from PayPal business loans. There's no other items that really contributed to that miss. Overall, PayPal business loans was about a 90 basis point drag to transaction margin and to operating margin, and this is approximately 2x what we expected at the beginning of the quarter. So it really was a real impact -- as it relates to our broader credit business, we're in a really good position. Like the rest of the industry, we're seeing some reversion back to pre-covid levels of performance. But across our diversified portfolio of consumer and merchant credit, we're seeing relatively stable delinquency and charge-off trends The largest growth area for us continues to be our Buy-Now-Pay-Later solutions, where our performance continues to be very strong. Of course, going forward, given our partnership with KKR, the majority of the originations are going to be funded off-balance sheet for us, and we'll be able to support the sustained growth of that business. On the PayPal business loan side, this is really the part of our portfolio where we have seen deterioration. This portfolio represents less than 15% of our overall net receivables. We've historically seen consistently strong performance in this book. And last year, we widened the credit box and the performance has not been within our expected risk appetite. We've taken steps to improve performance. We significantly tightened originations. Today, the book is down about 30% in total receivables, and we expect this pressure to continue through the back half of the year, but then really to abate as we move into next year. That said, the overall strength of our business and the momentum we're seeing is allowing us to maintain our operating margin and EPS guidance for the year while we're absorbing this credit pressure. Ramsey El Assal: Thanks so much, VERY helpful. Appreciate it. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg: I wanted to come back to branded TPV growth. So you had 6.5% in the month of June. You were over 8% in July, you're expecting further acceleration during the balance of the year. So can you just talk more specifically about the drivers of and the visibility on that ongoing improvement? Like how much of it is better macro? How much is traction with PayPal's own branded checkout initiatives and which among those branded checkout initiatives is moving the needle most materially here in 2023? A - Daniel Schulman : I'll take a crack at that, Jason. Thanks for the question. It's an important one we are really pleased, obviously, to see branded checkout accelerate like it is. And we have good confidence that the initiatives that we're putting into place are going to continue to drive that growth. As I think about what is driving that growth. It's hard to delineate exactly what is happening because of macro, in terms of e-commerce, improving in general, as I mentioned, to Tianjin's first question around e-commerce and what is due to our initiatives, but we are clearly putting a lot of time, effort and resource into improving the checkout experience. And my adds off to that entire checkout team for all that they've done here. And I say, look, first of all, as e-commerce is growing, we're going to grow with it because we are clearly one of the market leaders, if not the market leader in digital payments around that. We do have a scale advantage over anybody in terms of 30 million-plus merchants that we have out there, 80% of the top 1,500 Internet retailers. We have a performance advantage in checkout up to 600 basis points better in auto rates than the industry average. And we have a trust advantage. When small businesses put PayPal on their site, they see their online sales go up by almost 44%. So those are things that we are building upon. But as we mentioned in our Investor Day on June 8, we've -- the amount of acceleration in the amount of innovation we're putting into the market has improved dramatically.-- we did 100 A/B tests in the first quarter. We did 200 A/B tests and incremental 200 in the second quarter. We're going to do another $200 million coming here in the third quarter. And in general, about 30% or so of those AB tests that we run actually create positive benefit coming out of them. What that means is we're going to have like 150 or so improvements in checkout in our digital wallets running through our metrics as we go through. And some of those are 1 or 2 basis points difference. Some of those can increase DPA by 10 or 15 basis points. And when you put all of those together, it's extraordinarily powerful, and we are definitely seeing that in our results. We also are beginning to see a lot of our merchants move to our latest integrations. We know that when we're native in app on the mobile that we hold or gain share. We talked like a quarter or 2 ago, about 33 of our top 100 merchants had our latest checkout integrations, and we had an aspiration to be at 50 by the end of the year. I'm pleased to report that now 43 of our top 100 merchants are on our latest checkout integration. So we're making really good progress around that. We're not -- we're not about doing just like the basics. We are approving availability. Latency has now improved by 45% year-over-year. Every couple of milliseconds increases conversion rates on that. And passwordless is really important for us. And the rollout of Pass keys, some other authentication methodologies that we're using now ex the EU, which has SCA strong customer authentication, we're at about 70% of our checkouts that are passwordless. That's going to continue to go up as we push tasks, and we're now taking Paskes into the EU, which will be very beneficial because you can actually take out the friction of SCA in those conversions as well. And so we're going to push that really hard. And then you see all the other big initiatives that we're doing, the pre-introduction preapproved amount for buying -- by the way, in the U.S., we've rolled that out to 60 million of our customers. We are seeing 25% to 30% increase in first-time users of Buy -- now Pay Later and those are using it 5% to 10% more in terms of the overall TPV than those that didn't have the preapproved amounts. And we're going to roll out another $50 million preapproved into the EU beginning of this quarter. We're taking our rewards up, our rewards and cash back. We saw a 20% increase in the number of people using it from Q1 to Q2. We're now up over 10 million people using our rewards when they use our awards, their TPA goes up by 32%. So these are some of the things that we're doing that are making a big difference. We've got a lot of things planned for Q3, and we're beginning to see it in the results and hope to be able to continue to point that out and continue to highlight what we hope to be increased growth in branded checkout. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut: Could you provide an update on your cost takeout plan for 2023, the progress you've made? And do you have any preliminary thoughts quantifying how OpEx reductions will carry into 2024? A – Daniel Schulman: Yes. Thanks, David. I'll start and then probably Jens will jump in on this. Look, we're going to continue to do surgical discipline in our cost structure. -- down 11% and in Q2 for the full year. We still expect that to decline consistent with what we talked about by 10%. And therefore, when we think about our operating margin expansion coming up by at least 100 basis points and some of that incremental pressure that we're absorbing on the credit side that as Gabi mentioned, we'll kind of move through our numbers by the end of the year. You're obviously seeing growing margin expansion driven by some of the top line enhancements we're doing not just the cost discipline that we've demonstrated. I would just say that this is not just about efficiencies, but this is about doing things faster and accelerating the velocity of our innovation. -- it's not about trade-offs. It's about lower cost, but higher performance. And you're seeing that because I look at our MBS being at 7-year highs. Look at the amount of innovation that we're now pumping through the system right now. We're getting more done more efficiently. There's no question that AI is going to impact every single company and every function just as it will inside of PayPal. And we've been experimenting with a couple of hundred of our developers using tools from both Google, Microsoft as well as Amazon. And we are seeing 20% to 40% increases in engineering productivity. Just imagine that in terms of how much more product we can get into the market and how efficiently we can do that. And I think we've always known and anticipated that AI will drive productivity improvements really for foreseeable future.But I think the exciting more unexpected result is that we think it's going to transform our value proposition as well. things like enabling us to look into all of our transactions, look at early fraud metrics to be able to feed that back to customers with early fraud alerts that assured them that we are protecting them, enabling them to add more and more financial instruments to us as well that we can protect this PayPal assistant that's going to -- that's really an AI chatbot. We've been using it internally inside our consumer app. It's pretty amazing what it can do. Obviously, our advanced checkout, things like customized rewards. So AI is going to be a thing that not only drives productivity improvements for us, but really importantly, value proposition improvements for us. And so we're surgical on our cost thing. We've been very disciplined in it. We're quite pleased with it, and I think we'll see productivity improvements over the years to come. Gabrielle Rabinovitch: Yes. As Dan said, we're on track for a 10% decline in our other OpEx for the year. The first half is down kind of low double digits, call it, 11.5%, 12%. In the back half of the year, of course, we begin to lap some of the cost savings that we began to take out last year. And so the decline in other OpEx declines a bit, and so we'll be in sort of the high single digits then, building on what Dan said, just around delivering better experiences to our customers and the productivity gains, it's also coming from the platform migration and consolidation work that we're doing. And that too allows us to scale more efficiently over time. And so you should expect to see us continue to look for ways to deliver better experiences to our customers and scale them efficiently on our platform. Operator: Your next question comes from the line. Sorry, we have time for one last question, and it comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane: Question here. I wanted to ask about the consumer value prop and a big piece of that is going to be the wallet and the enhancements of the wallet, including offers. Can you just talk about some of the initiatives you're doing there that's going to improve the digital wallet going forward? Daniel Schulman: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. I mean, obviously, increasing the number of consumers who use our digital wallet. It's one of our most important initiatives because we feel it's going to drive both engagement ARPA, monthly active users -- the app user today, the typical app user has a 35% greater ARPU, 60% greater TPV and 25% less churn. And so the more we can put on that, the better and about 55% of our base today uses the app, just to give you an idea of that. And the app to your point, is designed to -- it's designed to enable the full shopping experience from discovery, which is like the deals and offers that you just mentioned to flexible payments, the widest array of funding choices, things like biop later, split tender that enables you to utilize 2 different funding sources to buy your purchase to post purchase, which includes package tracking and returns management, refunds directly into your PayPal wallet. I won't go in again to all the experimentation we're doing, but you can see kind of the tremendous amount of velocity there. The new features that are coming into the wallet include this early fraud alert. We've scaled that now to 10% and that's really designed to protect our customers. We can see fraudulent signals well before others. We can let a consumer know that their card has been compromised. We can simultaneously let the FI know so that card can be reissued instantaneously. And so we're seeing early but really positive response to consumers from this, and it causes them to defend these alerts that come that causes them to open the app, the more they open the app, the more they do with us. I think I mentioned on the rewards cashback that will be something that we'll be putting some resource into because we're seeing a tremendous interest in it. These users are up 20% quarter-over-quarter and the is gigantic improvement. As I mentioned, about a 32% improvement on that. Package tracking, we're now 100% ramped across iOS and Android. It scrapes basically your Gmail account to look for any of your e-commerce orders. They don't even have to be through PayPal. We consolidate them all into one place into our PayPal app. We're seeing a 20% app engagement uplift for those who sign up for that, a 10% improvement in TPA. Things like savings, that's now at a 4.3% interest rate. When somebody does that, their ARPA goes up $26 and they're logging to the app is up 16x those who don't have a savings account with us. I mentioned by not later preapproval, that's $50 million more to come this quarter in the EU. And we'll start things like our advanced AI checkout with our first clients later this year and our PayPal system using AI technology as well. Those are just some of the things to come. There's a lot of innovation. And as I mentioned, my hats off to the team because I think they're just doing a great job hitting their schedule, doing constant experimentation and really making our experiences much improved and moving towards best-in-class -- so thanks, everyone, for your great questions. I really appreciate it. I want to thank everybody for your time, and we look forward to speaking to all of you later. So take care. Thank you. Daniel Schulman: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. +]"

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in San Jose, California, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a technology platform that enables digital payments. On August 4, 2023, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock closed at $62.75 per share. One-month return of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was -6.05%, and its shares lost 34.17% of their value over the last 52 weeks. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a market capitalization of $70.011 billion.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""Our foray into the payments sector began a few years ago with an investment in Fiserv, which we detailed in our 2021 year-end letter to investors. While Fiserv continues to execute as expected, and the stock’s multiple has increased from recent lows of 14x to 16x earnings, shares still trade at a meaningful discount to the market. In the meantime, multiples across the “sexy, rapidly-growing disrupters” called out in our Fiserv thesis, have crashed like a house of cards in a hurricane. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) traded at nearly 70x earnings at its peak, or almost 3x the market’s multiple. It now trades at a multiple below Fiserv, roughly two-thirds of the market’s valuation. We didn’t think 70x was the right price a couple of years ago, and we don’t think 12x is the right price today. While the company has certainly had its share of missteps and miscalculations, we don’t think the business is broken. Competition has increased as share gains at Apple Pay have accelerated, heightening an already fiercely competitive landscape. At the same time, CEO Dan Schulman’s announced retirement has created a leadership void at the top. But a refocused management team under increased pressure from an activist investor to aggressively cut costs should drive accelerating free cash flow growth for the next several years. We have followed this company since our early investment in eBay, which was driven largely by the potential for a PayPal spin-off. We are happy to own it again at the current valuation.""Story continuespaypal, buy, rose, business, app, editorial, technology, touch, computer, phablet, mobile, woman, electronic, smartphone, payment, purchase, background, device, online,Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comPayPal Holdings, Inc.

This sector has the potential to transform various industries, particularly manufacturing and healthcare by creating new opportunities for growth and efficiency. Robotics also offers a competitive edge for investors who are looking to balance long-term returns with exposure to cutting-edge technologies. Below are three high potential robotics stocks that I think are about to have a significant rally in share price.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.comIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) is the pioneer and market leader in robotic-assisted surgery. The company’s flagship product, the da Vinci Surgical System, enables surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures with enhanced precision, control and dexterity. The system has been used in over 13 million surgeries across various specialties such as urology, gynecology, general surgery and cardiothoracic surgery.Intuitive has a strong competitive advantage due to its high-quality products, extensive patent portfolio and global distribution network. The robotics company’s revenue model also embeds a lucrative recurring element. This is tied to the services and operational leases related to the da Vinci product. ISRG also invests prudently but consistently in research and development to continue improving upon its technology and expanding its applications.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn July 20, ISRG released its Q2 2023 earnings and beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations on both revenue and EPS estimates. However, since the company noted new weight loss drugs were possibly eating into the growth in bariatric procedures, a target procedure for the business, the company’s stock stumbled. Because Intuitive Surgical’s core product growth remains impressive, this could be an attractive buying opportunity for investors before shares rally again.Story continuesZebra Technologies (ZBRA)A photo of the sign for Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) outside of a building.Source: Michael Vi/ShutterStock.comZebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is a leading provider of enterprise asset intelligence solutions, such as barcode scanners, printers, RFID tags, mobile computers and software. The company’s products ultimately help businesses track and manage their assets, data and workflows across various industries, such as retail, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing.The company also offers robotics solutions through Fetch Robotics, which provides robots for warehouse automation. The amalgamation of these diverse products with targeted end-markets have culminated in Zebra Technologies having a strong position in the growing market for enterprise asset intelligence solutions. This is bolstered by strong performance in Q1 2023 when the company beat analysts’ expectations.Though Zebra’s main focus is not building fancy robots, its value-add to enterprise supply chains makes it vital to many businesses’ digital transformation efforts, and thus a good pick for investors wanting exposure to robotics, automation, and supply chain management solutions.Teradyne (TER)Teradyne Silicon Valley officeSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comTeradyne (NASDAQ: TER) is a leading provider of automated test equipment for semiconductors, electronics, wireless devices and industrial automation. The company’s products help ensure the quality and performance of various devices and systems that power the modern world. The company’s robotics segments consist of Universal Robots, a leading supplier of collaborative robotic arms, and Mobile Industrial Robots, a leading maker of autonomous robots for industrial purposes.Because Teradyne is both a supplier of robotics parts and a provider of autonomous robots, the company’s revenue streams are quite diversified. A strong position in the fast-growing semiconductor testing market also helps to offset any potential slack in the robotics segment. For example, in its Q2 2023 earnings Teradyne’s semiconductor testing segment stole the show. While the company surpassed both revenue and profits estimates, the robotics giant was aided by increased demand for semiconductors that power AI processes. For the quarter, TER reported revenue of $684 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of 79 cents.The company’s stock has been performing well this year, rising over 30% so far. With spectacular AI-driven growth in Teradyne’s semiconductor testing business, the industrial robotics firm most likely has more untapped growth potential in the future.On the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Unlike traditional computers that use bits, quantum computers use qubits that can solve complex problems faster and more efficiently. In other words, these computers could revolutionize many industries. And we’re just at the beginning of this technological advancement. In this article, we’ll uncover the best quantum computing stocks to buy, highlighting highlight three hidden gems making incredible progress in this groundbreaking field.Each of these companies offers a unique and valuable proposition, showcasing innovative approaches to the challenges and possibilities of quantum computing.So, here are the best quantum computing stocks to add to your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIonQ (IONQ)A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ StockSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.comIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is one of the best quantum computing stocks for investors. The company’s technology allows its computers to perform longer, more complex calculations with fewer errors than any quantum computer yet built. That makes IonQ a speculative investment with significant growth potential.There’s a good reason to feel bullish on IONQ. The company recently entered into a significant partnership with QuantumBasel, Switzerland’s first quantum hub. The collaboration aims to establish a European quantum data center and includes the installation of two advanced IonQ quantum computers at QuantumBasel. The partnership is reportedly backed with over $500 million in private funding. That may help put IonQ on the map and give it a leg up over competitors.For momentum investors, there’s good reason to consider this stock too. It’s up 418% year to date. Its EPS is also forecasted to grow 20% over the next five years.Analog Devices (ADI)In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.. Semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockAnalog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a leading semiconductor company whose processing chips are vital to today’s digital economy. As quantum computing grows, related suppliers like semiconductors are expected to become increasingly important.Story continuesAs a mid-cap ($99.49 billion) stock, Analog Devices offers great growth potential. The brand beat revenue and earnings estimates last quarter. Sales grew 10% year-over-year, while earnings surged 18%. Sales were $3.26 billion, and adjusted earnings were $2.83 per share.Wall Street gave ADI stock a $207.83 price target. I think this target is feasible. The market has resumed its risk appetite for tech stocks, and speculative plays like ADI stock have come back into fashion. Its share also trades just below its 52-week high, and judging by its momentum indicators, it will breach this resistance zone shortly.Rigetti Computing (RGTI)An image of a computer chip on a motherboard; quantum computingRigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) is a full-stack quantum computing company that designs quantum chips, integrates those chips with a controlling architecture and develops software. This quantum computing stock should definitely be on your radar.Rigetti’s competitive advantage lies in its focus on hybrid quantum-classical computing systems. In short, it wants to give consumers the best of both worlds. It aims to accomplish this through the release of its Ankaa-1 84-qubit system. Once it has built significant traction with its release, it will attempt to capture a quantum advantage over its competitors.The company also recently entered into a collaboration agreement with ADIA Lab, an independent research institute based in Abu Dhabi specializing in data and computational sciences. The partnership aims to design, build, execute and optimize a quantum computing solution.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Jim Cramer Stock Picks This Week.Love him or hate him, it's a fact that Jim Cramer's stock picks and commentary gain a wide attention. Cramer is always ready to provide hints on possible winners and losers His commentary is often bold and his bets often blunt, without any fear of being proven wrong. While many investors follow his stock picks, others opt to trade the inverse of what he recommends. The formation of an inverse Jim Cramer strategy whereby investors trade the opposite of what the CNBC commentator suggests is becoming increasingly popular.Betting against Cramer's recommendations would have yielded a year-to-date return of 15%, barely beating the market by half a percentage. Investors who have traded the inverse of the commentator's recommendations have enjoyed a return of up to 22% over the past year. Some of the stocks that have generated significant returns in the inverse Cramer strategy include C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).However, Cramer has been right in his calls on several occasions. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of his top picks for the year. The stock has gone on to gain more than 40% year to date on benefiting from the tech bull rally.Cramer has also been bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a stock that has taken the market by storm, tripling in value and becoming a trillion-dollar company. Other top performers in his portfolio include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which have posted more than 40% yearly gains.Cramer also has an edge in calling out big winners outside tech. Some of his little-known gems that have rallied to 52-weeks highs and generated significant returns include Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI), Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A).Story continues11 Jim Cramer Stock Picks this WeekCramer recently warned of the need to be extremely cautious on stocks that continue to rally on the back of no solid underlying fundamentals in what he deems a frothy situation.The CNBC commentator is also staying clear of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), insisting that the drug maker faces increased competition and regulatory pressure for its lead products such as Keytruda. Cramer's Trust has also exited its position on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on concerns about the legal issues that the company faces with its baby powder and talc products. The analyst is also downbeat about Verizon and sees little growth.Our methodologyWe have compiled a list of stocks Jim Cramer believes have a significant upside potential compared to their peers. The stocks were picked from the CNBC commentator's recent shows on Mad Money, where he interacts with callers providing insights on how he believes different stocks will perform. We ranked the stocks based on the upside potential which was calculated on the basis of average analyst price estimates for these stocks.11. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Upside Potential: 8.89% Price target: $92.44According to Cramer, PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) is a great American company for anyone looking for some exposure in the auto industry. The stock has already rallied to its 52-week high after gaining more than 35% year to date.The rally comes at the back of an impressive record of positive earnings surprises. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) has not missed earnings consensus over the past four quarters, having delivered earnings of $2.25 a share for Q1 against $1.82 a share expected.At the start of the second quarter, PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) inked a strategic partnership with Toyota to develop Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks powered by Toyota Hydrogen fuel cells. Wall Street is overly optimistic about Paccar with Ana's verge price target of $92.44, which implies an 8.89% upside potential.10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Upside Potential: 8.88% Price target: $75.22According to Cramer, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a worthy stock to own for gaining some exposure in the burgeoning semiconductor sector. With the company looking to push the envelope in the AI memory market with its product development, it boasts tremendous potentialAccording to Cramer, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is well-positioned to benefit from the global chip shortage as it has a significant supply that meets demand from various sectors, including gaming, computing, and smartphones.In addition, the CNBC commentator believes the chip giant is trading at a cheap valuation compared to its peers, thus, well poised to benefit amid the AI fueled rally.According to the analyst, buying Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) on weakness would be an ideal play. The stock commands a $75.22 average price target implying an 8.88% upside potential.9. U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)Upside Potential: 8.94% Price target: $64U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) has outperformed the market in 2023 despite being a seasonal stock over the years. The stock is already up by more than 30% for the year, and Cramer believes it still has significant upside potential.There were concerns that U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)'s core business of renting trucks, trailers portable moving storage units would be hurt by more people opting to remodel houses instead of moving. However, that has yet to be the case.The storied do-it-yourself specialist benefits from moving activity bouncing back to historic trends.According to Cramer, U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) is an inexpensive stock that should continue increasing. The stock commands a $64 average price target implying 8.94% upside potential.8. Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL)Upside Potential: 10.42% Price target: $57.55Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) is another regional bank under immense pressure amid the banking crisis early in the year. The stock imploded from $71 a share to $26 per share in three days in March after the Silicon Valley bank blew up. The sell-off came amid concerns that the bank's depositors were fleeing.Fast forward, the bank's genuine deposits grew significantly in the second quarter, shrugging any concerns of a bank run. According to Cramer, the 50% run from 2023 lows is justified, and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) is well poised to continue edging higher, considering it is still down from its highs. Wall Street expects the stock to rally by 10%, going by the $57.55 average price target.7. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Upside Potential: 12.94% Price target: $70.42Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is one stock Cramer believes could rally to $75 a share after an impressive second quarter. The chip company is benefiting from the AI boom and looks set to follow in the footsteps of Nvidia.The company has acquired a portfolio of Ethernet and application-specific integrated chip technology, positioning it to benefit from the AI boom. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) also boasts a robust ASIC business that designs custom chips for specific purposes.While the stock is up by about 80% year to date, Cramer believes it is best to wait for a pullback before pulling the trigger. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) commands an average price target of $70.42 on Wall Street, implying a 12.94% upside potential.6. Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION)Upside Potential: 13% Price target: $42Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) is another regional bank that Cramer remains confident about as it continues to pick its pieces after the banking crisis.Like Western Alliance, Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) has had net inflows of deposits.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for McKesson Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$132bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$132b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$68bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$104b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$422, the company appears quite good value at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McKesson as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for McKessonStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today’s program over to Andy Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Andy Plenge: Thank you, Gigi and good morning everyone. We are pleased to have you with us for our 2023 second quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Jeanne Jones, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon senior management team are also with us today and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today’s presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. We would also like to remind you that today’s presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.15 Biggest Companies in Pakistan by Market CapPhoto by Matthew Henry on Unsplash You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today’s presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today’s presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It’s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and CEO. Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. We continue delivering on our plan as expected, which is a testament of all of the work put in by our dedicated employees. But before we get into our results and business updates, I’d like to first start by acknowledging a key milestone. In July, ComEd reached the end of the 3-year term of the deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice. At the court status hearing, the government moved to dismiss the charge, noting the company fully complied with the DPA, which the court granted in the hearing. We remain committed at all levels of the company to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior and we look forward to building on the trust of our customers as we continue to move forward. In that spirit, I am pleased to welcome Anna Richo to our Board of Directors. Anna is the General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary for Cargill and she brings highly complementary experience as an attorney and business leader. Her commitment to operational excellence and compliance will provide invaluable oversight. Now turning to the results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 4, we earned $0.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.41 per share on a non-GAAP basis. These results are right in line with what we expected this quarter, and we remain on track to earn within our guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share for 2023. We continue performing operationally at a very high level. Three of our four utilities had best on-record performance in outage frequency and outage duration, which I will touch on more on our next slide. We have also continued to progress through our rate case calendar with 6 active base rate cases underway in Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Most recently, on May 16, we filed our second multiyear plan for Pepco Maryland, the climate ready pathway plan. The filing outlines Pepco’s near-term proposal to advance the state’s climate and clean energy goals while taking steps to mitigate the impact of these efforts on customers’ bills. The proposal includes over $150 million of climate solution programs to help Maryland meet its goals in the areas of transportation electrification, building decarbonization, beneficial electrification and distributed energy integration. It also includes a proposed performance incentive mechanism to focus on reliability, greenhouse gas emission reductions and removal of equipment posing health and environmental risk. We look forward to working through the process with stakeholders and the commission staff toward rates effective in the second quarter of 2024. Beyond Pepco Maryland, we have now received intervenor testimony in our BGE and ComEd multiyear rate plans and filed our rebuttals, and additional milestones await us in those cases in August, along with activity for Delmarva Delaware and Atlantic City Electric. The Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia has also set its schedule for the Pepco D.C. multiyear plan. You will hear more from Jeanne about all the work underway to align with our regulatory stakeholders. Now looking past 2023, we’ll also remind you of the guidance we’ve previously provided on our long-term outlook. We expect to be at the midpoint or better of our 2021 to 2025 and 2022 to 2026 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth ranges and to grow the dividend in line with those earnings. Over the next 4 years, we anticipate investing over $31 billion to support the energy transformation, which is what’s driving that growth. And I’ll remind you that we continue finding opportunities to further support the transformation, whether it’s increasing affordability for customers or strengthening the durability of our long-term investment plans. For instance, we have talked about our efforts pursuing grants under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which support the investment programs we have laid out for the commissions. And we recently announced winning approximately $30 million of grant funding for middle mile broadband investments at BGE and ComEd. Additionally, you may have also seen that PJM recently voted to proceed with transmission upgrades to address reliability challenges associated with the retirement of the brand insurers coal plant in Eastern Maryland with over $850 million of work assigned to our utilities. Now, while most of the incremental spend for that investment occurs beyond our current guidance window, it’s a great illustration of how we continue to have opportunities to strengthen and lengthen our expected rate base growth as the largest pure T&amp;D utility in the United States. Our transmission upgrades ensure customers are able to buy cleaner generation and that they can depend on a reliable, resilient grid to deliver that power. Before I move on to operations, I want to mention that we published our latest Exelon Sustainability Report in mid-July. This is the 12th report in our company’s history. We are incredibly proud of the work our organization puts into ensuring we are leading the energy transformation in an affordable and equitable manner. Our purpose, powering a cleaner and brighter future for our customers and communities, really shines through that report. And the progress we continue to make in fulfilling that purpose is meaningful. Here are a few examples. We have connected over 200,000 customers with over 3 gigawatts of renewable energy resources, a 16% increase over 2021. We saved close to 25 million megawatt hours in 2022 with our award-winning energy efficiency programs, a 9% increase that avoided 9.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases and saved customers over $30 million at our average retail rate. Our support for diverse suppliers is now up more than 56% from 2018 levels, having spent $2.9 billion with such suppliers in 2022. Additionally, 62% of our $7.5 billion total supplier spend is with companies in the communities we serve. Our annual sustainability report illustrates all the ways in which our more than 19,000 employees ensure our communities greatly benefit from the work we are doing to support their energy transformation goals. Turning to Slide 5. I’ll provide an update on our operating performance for the first half of the year. As it pertains to reliability, we continue setting the bar for performance. All 4 utilities operated in at least the top quartile, and ComEd, PECO and PHI achieved best on record outage frequency performance. That makes it the second quarter in a row for ComEd and PHI for best on record performance. Those 3 utilities also happen to achieve best on record system outage duration performance, and BGE continues to operate in the top quartile. Their performance illustrates that the investments we are making in the grid provide the footing for this operational excellence. And then it is up to our employees to rise to the challenge of keeping customers online or getting them back online as quickly as possible when outages do occur. Now that job is getting harder to do with storms growing more frequent and severe. But it’s increasingly important to do as society depends more and more on electricity. Nationally, we expect to see 50% annual growth in electric cars and 12% annual growth in data centers. And ComEd particularly, is already seeing sizable opportunity in data centers. The data center growth will only strengthen as industries increasingly rely on cloud services and AI. As the nation’s largest T&amp;D company, we must rise to the challenge of meeting these incremental demands on the grid. This operational performance was matched on the gas side, with all 3 utilities continuing to perform at top decile levels for gas odor response. Our customer satisfaction scores remain in line with those reported in our first quarter call. Our utilities are performing in the second quartile versus the 2021 benchmark when costs across the board were lower, pandemic relief had not yet rolled off and customers had not yet been impacted by the escalating interest rates and commodity prices. We are working every day to ensure customers are aware of the options they have to manage their costs, and we have seen increased engagement by our customers through these efforts. In fact, ComEd announced just 2 weeks ago that it won several recognitions in the 20th Annual Best Practices awards by Chartwell. These annual Chartwell awards recognize excellence among electric and gas utilities with respect to customer-oriented projects, programs and service initiatives. One of these awards included recognition for ComEd’s community energy assistance ambassador program. This program originally launched in 2020 in response to the economic impact of the pandemic. It was designed with a community-based organization to increase education and access to financial assistance options that can help income eligible customers pay their electric bills while creating local employment opportunities for the same vulnerable population. But it is a constant reminder of the importance of focusing on value for our customers as well as affordability, and we are continuously seeking to reduce our own operating costs in addition to pursuing the customer-focused initiatives we have discussed. I will conclude by discussing our safety performance, where we lost ground at 3 of our 4 utilities. Ensuring our employees and contractors operate in a safe environment is of paramount importance. Lower performance this quarter largely resulted from low-impact OSHA recordables like slips and falls and minor vehicle-related incidents. As a result, each of our operating companies have action plans underway to address areas of needed improvement to ensuring that we are operating at our standards. This includes revisiting our safety plans for the year to ensure they are adequately addressing the issues we have observed year-to-date. Other examples include facility reviews to enhance safety and expanding our simulation-based training to offer more opportunities for employees. We are working hard to drive safety performance to the levels that we expect. I will now turn it over to Jeanne to discuss our financial performance and provide additional color on our regulatory activity in the second quarter. Jeanne? Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter financial update along with the outlook for the second half of 2023, our progress on the 23 rate case schedule, and I’ll also highlight an ongoing project that exemplifies our commitment to delivering sustainable value as the premier T&amp;D energy company by modernizing critical infrastructure in the Philadelphia area. Starting on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2023 versus $0.44 in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting lower results of $0.03 per share over the same period. Results of $0.41 in the second quarter were right in line with the expectations provided in the prior earnings call. Earnings are lower in the second quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities as well as $0.03 of unfavorable weather at PECO. This was partially offset by $0.03 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with incremental investments net of depreciation as well as a $0.01 of carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit balance at ComEd. Despite another quarter of mild weather impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions, we delivered earnings results exactly where we said. Through the first half of 2023, operating earnings are $1.11 per share, reflecting 47% of the projected full year earnings. This is in line with how we performed through the first half of 2022. Looking ahead to next quarter, we expect a relative EPS contribution in the third quarter to be approximately 28% of the midpoint of our projected 2023 operating earnings guidance range. Recall that Q3 2022 saw strong growth from $0.04 of higher rates and effect with PECO’s electric rate case in year one of its current rate cycle as well as $0.03 of realized 30-year treasury rate uplift on ComEd’s formula rate distribution ROE and another $0.03 of distribution formula rate timing at ComEd. While the fundamentals underpinning the earnings remaining this year, we expect third quarter ‘23 results to be lower. Net distribution and transmission growth will be offset by higher interest and we also expect some timing of O&amp;M and taxes. For the fourth quarter of ‘23, we expect year-over-year earnings growth to benefit from the absence of proactive derisking that occurred in the fourth quarter of ‘22, the expected reversal of the O&amp;M and tax timing and the anticipated onetime impact of BGE’s reconciliation for the ‘21 and ‘22 under recovery of its first multiyear plan. As we do not receive the final order on the reconciliation for BGE until December of ‘23, we cannot record BGE’s earnings associated with the reconciliation until that time. In line with discussion on the first quarter earnings call, we expect the $0.07 of unfavorable weather experienced year-to-date to be offset with the combination of O&amp;M levers across the platform, favorable depreciation at PECO and the full year earnings impact of the carrying costs associated with the CMC regulatory asset balance. On a full year basis, we continue to reaffirm our 2023 EPS guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share. Through a continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and strong cost control across the platform, we remain on track to deliver earnings at the midpoint or better of our guidance range. With several months of weather and storm exposure remaining, you can expect we will manage utility work plans to deliver earnings within expectations. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 68% from 2021’s and 2022 guidance midpoint through 2025 and 2026, respectively, with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range. Turning to Slide 7. As Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front. Since the last earnings call, there was one new rate case filed, so I’ll provide a status update on each of the six current open proceedings, starting with the most recent filing. On May 16, Pepco Maryland submitted its climate ready pathway, a 3-year multiyear plan application to the Maryland Public Service Commission. Pepco is requesting a $213.6 million revenue increase over the April 2024 and to December 2027 period, inclusive of a proposed 9-month extension reflecting an ROE of 10.5%. The filing outlines investments the company expects to make to support a climate-ready grid and enable cleaner energy programs and technologies that support Maryland’s goal to reach net zero emissions by 2045. As an example of the $150 million of climate solution programs that Calvin mentioned are included in Pepco’s proposed plan, more than half are dedicated to incentive for approximately 10,000 equipment electrification conversions for customers transitioning to cleaner technologies like heat pumps in the building sector. Another key category of spend is dedicated to enhancing reliability, resiliency and grid security through the installation of more modernized equipment that automatically detect system issues, reinforces the grid against more severe weather and protects the grid from potential physical or cyber threats. Overall, these investments are anticipated to inject more than $1.42 billion into the local economy and support more than 11,000 full-time jobs. For the last 3 years, spanning 2020 to 2022, Pepco has reported the best reliability performance of any electric distribution utility in the state of Maryland, a true testament to the company’s commitment of powering a cleaner and brighter future for its customers and communities. Equally as important as reliability, Pepco is focused on keeping affordability front and center for our customers. The multiyear plan includes the acceleration of tax benefits to serve as a bill offset as well as efforts to increase participation in energy assistance and energy efficiency programs, which in 2022 alone provided approximately $23 million to Pepco Maryland customers. An order is expected by June of 2024. Let me also remind you of the other electric distribution rate cases in progress. First, Delmarva Power Delaware has revised a revenue request for a $41.8 million increase based on an updated test period in the electric rate case and, as permitted by Delaware law, implemented full proposed rates on July 15 subject to refund. A decision is expected in the second quarter of 2024. Similarly, ACE revised their revenue request for a $93.6 million increase based on an updated test period, with the final order expected in the first quarter of ‘24. Additionally, after an 8-month receiving, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a 4-year capital tracker at ACE called Powering the Future, which accelerates the portfolio of projects totaling $93 million designed to enhance reliability and resiliency for customers, advance New Jersey’s energy master plan goals and sustained economic growth in the region. Next, ComEd and BGE surpassed two key milestones in their multiyear plan rate cases, having received intervener testimony and filed their rebutals to support the key elements of the company’s initial proposals earlier this year. As discussed on prior earnings calls, both plans outline the investments needed to provide essential service to customers while meeting the clean energy and equity goals of their respective states. In both the ComEd and BGE multiyear plan rate cases, evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late August with briefs to follow before final orders are expected in December. Lastly, Pepco received a procedural schedule from the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia in its second multiyear rate plan filing. Upcoming milestones include intervenor testimony expected to be filed by the DC Public Service Commission staff on October 16 and evidentiary hearing set to begin in January of 2024 with final briefs in March of 24. Relationships across our jurisdictions remain constructive, and we are working together with our regulators, states and communities through every step of the process to reach our shared goals. As Calvin mentioned, by next year, we expect our resolution on all four of the ongoing multiyear rate plans in Illinois, Maryland and D.C. and a clear path forward to supporting clean energy and climate goals in an affordable and equitable manner. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 26 of the appendix. Moving to Slide 8. During the second quarter, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $7.2 billion guidance for 2023. These investments in energy infrastructure are vital to maintaining the high standard of service that we have in serving our customers while preparing the grid for the clean energy transformation and increasing levels of electrification. Today, I’ll talk about how PECO is partnering with the community to build a new 69-13kV substation in Philadelphia at the Civic Terminal Yard and neighboring property. PECO’s commitment to building for the new civic substation began in 2019. This $130 million project includes installation of insulated switchgear and modifications to 4 69-kV and transmission lines into civic substations that will allow for the retirement of 2 69-kV transmission lines currently running under the [indiscernible]. The new substation is expected to increase distribution and transmission reliability through the reconfiguration of the lines and increased flood resiliency in the low-lying areas surrounding the substations, where access has been restricted in the past following heavy thunderstorms. It will also enable PECO to relieve low constraints, supply additional capacity to the University City area and better serve critical customers on the west side of the river. Once it’s fully energized, which is expected by the second quarter of ‘24, the Civic substation will be PECO’s newest and most modern insulated substation. While traditional open-air substation construction would have required 5 to 7 acres of land, the upgraded electrical that meant associated with the insulated substation allows PECO to build on less than a 2-acre plot of land. That represents a 60% to 70% reduction in required land use. Since project inception, PECO has partnered with its customers, government agencies and other local utilities to ensure construction of the Civic substation has a minimal impact to the city of Philadelphia, the surrounding customers and on the environment, protecting the nearby waterway and riverbank. With vital customers in the area such as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania Hospital and the Philadelphia Veteran Affairs Medical Center, operational excellence is imperative. As an Exelon utility, PECO is ready to deliver it. Turning to Slide 9. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity. As a reminder, we continue to project 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average over our guidance period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above S&amp;P and Moody’s downgrade thresholds of 12%, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. If the corporate alternative minimum tax is not mitigated through an inclusion of repairs in its calculation, we anticipate being at 100 basis points or the lower end of that range. We continue to await specific guidance on the corporate alternative minimum tax implementation and are hopeful to have resolution by year-end. In the meantime, the Department of Treasury issued a notice granting deferral of estimated tax payments associated with the corporate alternative minimum tax until 2024, which points to the appreciation that more guidance is required for implementation. From a financing perspective, we successfully raised nearly $1.3 billion for BGE and PECO in the second quarter, which completes all of our planned debt financing needs for 2023. The strong investor demand we continue to see for our debt offerings is supported by the strength of our balance sheet and by the low-risk attributes of our platform. In line with the last earnings call, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $425 million of equity at the holding company by ‘25. We will continue to update you as we make progress on the plan. Thank you. And I’ll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks. Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. I will once again remind the investment community of what we’re working to accomplish in 2023. We take great pride in our operational excellence, which our employees dedicate themselves to daily. Summer is when we see some of the most severe weather activity, and our teams embrace the challenge to get customers back online quickly and safely. As we proceed with our work of supporting the energy transformation in our ongoing rate cases, we are very focused on listening to our stakeholders. We want to ensure that we are delivering the right investment plans and the right services to support meeting their energy transformation and climate goals in an affordable and equitable manner. After this year, much of our path forward for the next several years will be established and clear. The team also understands it must deliver on our financial priorities and guidance. Efficiently investing $7.2 billion of capital and earning ROEs in the 9% to 10% range will support meeting our 2023 earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share and keeping our balance sheet strong. And finally, we’re continuing to look for innovative ways to support our customers and communities end-to-end throughout our business. In partnership with the Exelon Foundation, we are looking to place our next round of investments in the $20 million climate change investment initiative fund or 2c2i, an innovative way to advance solutions to the challenges brought by climate change, while improving the quality of life for residents of our cities. For this year, five companies were selected to receive investments, spanning areas like software analytics to track air quality, non-recyclable plastic reuse and novel EV charging solutions. Every day, we’re reminded that the energy transformation is happening, and we have to be a vital role in it. And we have a talented team that’s incredibly excited to play that role. We recently announced that Colette Honorable will be joining us as our Executive Vice President of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer, as a renowned energy policy leader who brings expertise in areas like clean energy transformation and equable ratemaking, she will be an invaluable addition to our team. And she’ll help us build on the strong foundation we already have in place, built by the team that got us here. In particular, I want to recognize Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our business services company, Bridget Reidy who is retiring in September and played an integral role in shaping our organizational commitment to excellence. She also made incredible strides in diversity, equity and inclusion across the wide variety of corporate support groups that she led like IT and supply. Thank you, Bridget, for your leadership. Our team’s commitment to leading the energy transformation is what makes us the premier transmission and distribution utility, one that lives by its values, supports its communities and offers a uniquely strong expected total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. Thank you, as always, for your interest. I’ll now turn it to Gigi for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Calvin Butler: David, good morning. David Arcaro: Let’s see, wondering if you could speak to the comment and BGE rate cases and how these have progressed so far relative to your expectations? Just when you look at the key intervener testimony that we’ve gotten so far, like staff in both cases, how have these shaped up overall in terms of the focus areas versus what you had expected? Calvin Butler: Yes, David, thank you. This is Calvin. I would tell you that they are proceeding as planned. And the teams have provided their responses, and as Jeanne mentioned, we’re going through the process. But we have with us both Gil Quiniones, President and CEO of ComEd; and Carim Khouzami, President and CEO of BGE, who can – I will ask them to just kind of take your time and walk you through some of the highlights of each and what you can expect moving forward. I’ll start with Gil of ComEd. Gil Quiniones: Yes. This is Gil from ComEd. The ICC staff and interveners in the aggregate did not waver from their initial positions filed in their direct testimony in May. They maintained their position in ROE and the pension asset. Their challenges on capital center on certain IT projects, our fiber and proposed private LTE communications network upgrades and systematic and programmatic spending. The rate case process still playing out, as Calvin mentioned, and we will continue to make our case for those capital investments. We continue to have regular meetings with staff and interveners to provide additional information, answer any of their questions and provide clarification. Calvin Butler: Carim? Carim Khouzami: Good morning. This is Carim Khouzami from BGE. As Calvin mentioned, the case is proceeding as expected. The staff has come in with a proposal of about 70% of our ask. As expected, some of the areas of debate surround ROE investments in our gas system and some building electrification programs that BG proposed for the first time to help the state meet its climate change goals. One of the things to point out, as you know, reconciliations of the first time it is being done in Maryland in a multiyear plan. Both staff and OPC and other intervening parties suggested about 90% of our requests. So again, that is proceeding well. So all in all, going well. As Calvin and Jeanne mentioned, we have more hearings at the end of August, early September with the final order expected in mid-December. Calvin Butler: And David, I would just add to that, both plans were built on helping the states meet their environmental and climate goals as well as economic development and job creation opportunities. So the stakeholder process, I don’t want to underrepresent because both companies have been very engaged in that process and meeting with all stakeholders. So again, proceeding, it’s a process that will play itself out. But we expect orders for both companies by the end of the year. David Arcaro: That’s really helpful color. Thanks for all that. And appreciating that there are new commissioners in both states, do you see an opportunity for settling on any issues, partial settlement, full settlement? Or is the expectation and strategy just kind of see this through kind of a fully litigated case more likely? Calvin Butler: No, great question, David. We expect to see them both fully through and recognizing that, as Carim mentioned, first time for the reconciliation process in Maryland. And it’s the next 3 years, we will see it through and let it play out. And for Gil, moving from the formula rate to a 4-year multiyear plan, it’s important that everyone feels that they have had a chance to voice their opinions and that stakeholder process is critical to that. So we do see it playing out all the way to the end of the year. David Arcaro: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Calvin Butler: Thank you. Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of James Kennedy from Guggenheim Partners. Calvin Butler: Good morning, James. James Kennedy: Hi, guys. Good morning. How it going? Calvin Butler: Good.James Kennedy: So I guess I’ll start with the transmission announcement this morning, the $870 million for brand insurers. Is the portion that falls in the current plan, purely incremental? And secondly, any color on the potential quantum of other opportunities like these as we start to see other retirements in CMC and BGE? Calvin Butler: Thank you, James. First off, it is all additive to the current plan. We do not have any of that, as we’ve conveyed to you previously, we were never going to put anything that we were striving to get until we want it. So that’s important. I have with us today David Velazquez, our EVP of Operations, to provide additional oversight or insight into this because David oversees our transmission strategy across Exelon. So David? David Velazquez: Yes. Thank you, Calvin. And James, thanks for the question. Besides the brands insurers transmission reinforcements that are needed, you may be aware that PJM also has an open – what they call an open window to help transmission reinforcements needed for additional load growth in the Dominion territory. That is currently open. We have submitted four different proposals in that open window range from, I will say, smaller enhancements in the $300 million range to large projects that helped meet both short and longer term needs that are well over $1 billion. And PJM will provide an initial readout of their recommendations committee meetings in September-October timeframe with an expected decision from the PJM Board in December of this year. In addition to that, there are offshore – their transmission reinforcements needed for offshore wind, both in New Jersey and also in Maryland. And there is legislation in Maryland that requires the PSC by July 1st of next year to make a report back to the legislature and then to issue a solicitation for transmission reinforcements for offshore wind by July of ‘25. So, not just with the brand insurers retirement, but offshore wind, load growth, and again, cannot predict generation retirements, but if they occur, we are ready to do what we need to do to ensure the reliability of the grid. Calvin Butler: Thank you, David. James Kennedy: Excellent. And then just second question real quick. Can we get an update on the ComEd franchise agreement process? Calvin Butler: Yes. Right now, it’s status quo. You can appreciate the team has been very involved in the franchise. And with the new Mayor coming in line, he is assembling his team. Gil and the ComEd team have been working very closely with him on several issues. And really, what we are talking about is that we had come to an agreement with the livelihood [ph] administration earlier this year, as you know, on that franchise. And the parameters of that proposal, we have discussed with you on previous calls. But at this time, the Mayor and I think the team is looking at those provisions and trying to make it his own, this administration’s own. Gil, would you have anything else you would like to add there? Gil Quiniones: The only thing I want to add, Calvin, is that we have had initial conversations with them, and they had informed us when they are ready, we will engage and restart our negotiations for a new franchise in Chicago. But in the meantime, our existing franchise agreement continues. Calvin Butler: And that’s very important for us. And in addition, I just want to recognize that Gil has been partnering with them. He was just recently named to the Environmental Justice Transition Subcommittee for this Mayor. So, the team has plugged in with the administration, and more of why that’s important is they are understanding what their priorities are as a new administration. And I think that will play directly into the new franchise agreement. James Kennedy: Wonderful. Thanks guys. Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America. Calvin Butler: Hi Paul. Paul Zimbardo: Hi. Good morning team. Thank you for the time. Calvin Butler: Good morning.Paul Zimbardo: First, I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity. If you could briefly comment on that SEC matter that you disclosed in the earnings results that you just out, does this fully resolve that legacy SEC investigation? Jeanne Jones: Hey, good morning Paul, it’s Jeanne. So, the SEC investigation is still ongoing, but we did reach a point where a loss contingency was probable. So, we did book that. You can see it’s treated similarly to how we had treated the initial DPA amount. It’s a non-operating one-time nonrecurring item that is in non-operating earnings. So, it’s continuing, but it is related to the investigation that began in 2019, so the same original investigation. Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. Yes. I just wanted to clarify that’s original stream. Jeanne Jones: Yes. Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. And then second, just as we think about the long-term, I know you reaffirmed that expectation midpoint or better 2023 plus, just interest rates keep ticking up stubbornly like 50 basis points even since the last update. Could you discuss some of the areas of offsets, whether cost or otherwise, to kind of combat those higher parent costs? Thanks. Calvin Butler: Yes. Well, I will start and then I will turn it over to Jeanne. As you have alluded to is that we are seeing – our customers aren’t immune to the higher-cost commodity prices that are going on across the country. But we have always, as a company, been very aggressive in managing our costs, and that didn’t change upon the separation. Our first and foremost priority was ensuring that our costs didn’t go up as a result of that separation. But let me tell you some of the things that we have done. We have realigned our real estate portfolio, creating flexible work arrangements to rationalize our office footprint. We have automated – we continue to look for ways to automate our work processes and really becoming more efficient and nimble in response to our customers’ needs. And we have centralized our transmission operations to harness best practices on organizational efficiencies. And it’s important to note that over the course of our – since 2016 with the course of our plan, our O&amp;M CAGR has only gone up 1.7%. And the year-over growth is just over 1% in 2023. I say that to you to say that costs continue to be a primary focus of the organization and affordability for our customers. Having said that, we are not done. We are just scratching the surface as a leadership team to really look at how we are going to operate as one Exelon, as a pure transmission and distribution utility company. And we continue to focus on that. So, that is what our focus is on day-in and day-out. Jeanne? Jeanne Jones: Yes, I think that’s well said and all of that helps to reduce the O&amp;M and preserve the cash, which minimizes the amount also that we need to finance in terms of our investments, so getting that cash and redeploying it back into the business. The only other thing I will add is on the interest rates, how we do as a whole – at the operating companies, we are stepping into new – sort of new rate cases, so the ability to recover the incremental interest there is important. But at the parent company, we do engage in reinsurance hedging and so being able to lock in with certainty ahead of time heading into a year what that interest expense is, is important. So, we will continue those practices that helped us heading into ‘23, and you can expect us to do that for future issuances as well. Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. Thank you for the color team. I appreciate it. Calvin Butler: Thank you, Paul. Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities, LLC. Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is actually David Kelly [ph] on for Jeremy. Just wondering, would you be able to outline your current credit metrics relative to thresholds and plan targets? And how could this ultimately contribute to your 425 remaining equity? Jeanne Jones: Sure. It’s Jeanne. So, on the current credit metrics, I think S&amp;P and Moody’s just recently published kind of the prior 12 months, those were at 13%. And as we show in our slides and as I talked about in the script, as we look at our ‘23 through ‘26 time period, we expect to be at that average of 13%. And as a reminder, our downgrade threshold is 12%. And that 12% is afforded to us and we don’t take it lightly, that’s why we have that cushion. But it’s a reflection of our low-risk platform, right, diversity, scale, forward-looking rate mechanisms, 75% decoupled revenues. So, all of that put together, no generation, all of that results in a very low risk profile. But we like to manage at that 100 basis points or 200 basis points above that.So, at the 13%, as the rate agencies just published, we expect to be at that 13%. If we get the corporate alternative minimum tax mitigated, we would be closer the mid-higher, like that 13.5%, 14%. And we are hopeful to know that final regulations or at least preliminary regulations by the end of the year. You asked how that relates to our equity. We have no change in plans related to the 425. So, said another way, if we got the corporate alternative minimum tax alleviated, we would still do that 425. And so you can expect us to do that sometime between now and 2025. The last thing I will say is just as it relates to Moody’s and S&amp;P, there is a little bit of difference in the calculation. S&amp;P will sort of trend at that 13% over that time horizon. Moody’s, however, because of the calculation, there is some cash timing differences. So, we expect to be sort of on the low end in ‘23, ‘24 and then on the higher end in the back end, such that you average 13%. And that’s really driven by some of the formula rate timing at ComEd with the true-up coming for ‘22 and ‘23 coming in, in ‘24 and ‘25. But that’s sort of – that’s why we give you the average because we want to sort of neutralize some of that cash flow timing as well. Unidentified Analyst: Appreciate the color. I will leave it there. Thanks. Calvin Butler: Thank you. Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport: Hey. Good morning. Calvin Butler: Good morning. Carly Davenport: Thanks so much for taking the questions. You had mentioned kind of O&amp;M levers to offset mild weather this year. So could you just talk a little bit about how O&amp;M costs have been tracking relative to your expectations? And then what you expect to see for the balance of the year from a rate of change perspective on O&amp;M? Calvin Butler: So initially, we have always maintained a philosophy that we will drive O&amp;M costs below the rate of inflation. Now that was over the traditional rate of inflation that we have been experiencing over the last several years, keeping that around 2% to 2.5%. And as I mentioned, we are trending strong and keeping or meeting our objectives of doing so. And that has always been our benchmark. The CEOs who are sitting around the table, we talk about keeping our O&amp;M flat and seeing what levers are driving it to possibly go up, which allows us that flexibility when you have unseasonally warm winters or anything else in PECO or the like, we got 75% of our rate base, our 73% is decoupled. So, a lot of the weather impacts that you are talking about really focus on PECO primarily as the largest utility that’s done. Having said that, we will continue to manage those costs. We never take our foot off the gas in doing so. Jeanne? Jeanne Jones: Yes. And as it relates to the weather for ‘23, we had a combination of offsets across the platform, mostly at PECO, BGE and PHI given ComEd has the formula rate true-up on O&amp;M. But across those three operating companies, we saw O&amp;M levers, whether it was taking advantage of labor vacancies, lower T&amp;E and contracting spend. And then in addition to that, PECO had some favorable depreciation. So, the combination of all that was probably around $0.04 of the $0.07 of weather, and then we had the ComEd carrying costs, which were a benefit this year. And it’s a benefit this year relative to last year because we did not have this large reg asset really sort of was built up at the back end of last year. And the interest deposit rate on that was zero for the commission. So, we weren’t getting an interest offset, even though we were incurring interest on that last year. However, now in this year is a benefit both to last year and to guidance because we have the larger reg asset this year. And while we are still incurring the carrying cost on that, the ICC reset the deposit rate at 5% this year. And so relative to guidance, we are now having an offset to that, that wasn’t baked into our plan. So, that’s probably about $0.03 of the $0.07. So, you put all that together, that’s how we are offsetting the $0.07 of weather. And to Calvin’s point, we just continue to focus on what else we can do to drive down those costs. And we are just starting to scratch the surface there.Carly Davenport: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you. And then just on the corporate minimum tax. I know you mentioned expecting to at least get kind of preliminary clarity there by the end of this year. But is there any color that you can share maybe from your discussions around the temperature on the tax repairs deduction and getting the gating factors to that being included? Jeanne Jones: I would just say there is – it’s probably not much else to share. There are ongoing discussions. Their stakeholders remain receptive to the discussion and to the technical differences that the utility industry faces in being a very capital-intensive utility and some of the regulatory accounting that will release that capital-intensive nature of our industry. So, receptive discussions ongoing. And I did mention earlier in the script, we did see some guidance come out in June that basically said, hey, if you think you are subject to this tax, you won’t be penalized if you don’t pay it this year. We understand there is more sort of guidance and interpretation needed. And so that was just one other data point. But just ongoing discussions and we remain hopeful that we will have more clarity by the end of the year. Carly Davenport: Awesome. Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra: Hey guys. Good morning. We are close to the hour here. Thanks for giving me time. Jeanne Jones: Good morning. Calvin Butler: Good morning. Durgesh Chopra: Good morning Calvin. Good morning Jeanne. So, I just want to go back to the ComEd rate case real quick. And some of us were expecting an update from staff on the ROE calculation and the output itself. It seems like they are kind of using the same methodology and using rates as of last year. Just how do you see that progressing? Any thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you. Jeanne Jones: Yes. I think as Gil mentioned, still more to come. We are still putting forth a strong argument around our proposed ROE. As you mentioned, they did not change their position. It appears to be sort of this continuation of the formula, which [indiscernible] was clear that the sunset of the formula rate was required. So, our filing offers an ROE that we feel appropriately reflects the actual cost of equity, taking into account the current market conditions. So, we will continue to work through that process. I think there is that data point and then there is the Electric Proxy Group, which is also another data point in the staff testimony. So, we will continue to work through that with them, but no changes as of this point. Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. It sounds like we will get an update here before the end of the year. Just switching gears, I have a question on supply chain, and Calvin or anybody else in the room, would love your views there. Just we have seen several media reports on transformer shortages. So, maybe broadly, can you comment, you have a sizable CapEx plan, obviously. But just broadly, can you comment on equipment shortages, labor shortages? And how is that tracking this year versus, let’s say, 12 months ago? Calvin Butler: Yes. I would tell you that one of the, I would say, advantage is of being of our scale and our platform is that we are able to leverage the size to not only access our current suppliers, but identify new ones. So, directly to your question, we have not seen a shortage in our transformers. We have not seen a shortage in workforce or any other things that are impacting us executing on this capital plan. Now, what we do pay attention to, as new businesses coming online, our ability to give that online in the timeframe that some of our customers are looking for because that wasn’t part of that initial planned work. So, we stay on top of that and working with our supply organization. But to-date, we are not experiencing those same issues that others made.Jeanne Jones: And I think one of the benefits of our profile rate of the $31 billion, as we have talked about before, not one project is greater than 1% of that spend. So, the ability to kind of manage that portfolio in bite sizes to the extent we do experience any issues allows us to be able to stay on track and deliver. Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks again guys. Calvin Butler: Thank you. Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and CEO, for closing remarks. Calvin Butler: Gigi, thank you very much. And I just want to always thank you all for joining us today. From the comments made today by Jeanne and I and the leadership team around the table, you see that we are focused on delivering on plan. So, as always, appreciate your interest, and this concludes our call. Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.]"

(NASDAQ:XRAY) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript August 3, 2023 Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Dentsply Sirona Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrea Daley; Vice President of Investor Relations. Andrea Daley: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Dentsply Sirona Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me for today’s call is Simon Campion, Chief Executive Officer, and Glenn Coleman, Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to remind you that an earnings press release and slide presentation related to the call are available in the Investors section of our website at www.dentsplysirona.com. Additionally historical financial data for our new segment is also available on our website. Yesterday, we announced that the company identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, which did not result in a material misstatement of the company’s previously issued financial statements.Lucky Business/Shutterstock.com For more information, refer to Item 801 of the company’s current report on Form 8-K filed on August 2, 2023. Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today’s call, we may make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results. We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations on future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recently filed Form 10-K and any updating information in subsequent SEC filings lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Additionally on today’s call, our remarks will be based on non-GAAP financial results. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently our business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Please refer to our press release for the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results. Comparisons provided are to the prior year quarter unless otherwise noted. A webcast replay of today’s call will be available on the Investor section of the company’s website following the call. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Simon. Simon Campion: Thank you, Andrea, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our Q2 2023 Earnings Call. Today, I’ll start by providing an overview of our recent performance. Glenn will cover Q2 results and the updated 2023 outlook and then I will finish by providing a strategic operating update. Starting on Slide 4. We were pleased with the second quarter results, delivering more than 2% organic sales growth. These results rounded out a strong first half of the year in which we exceeded our commitments and delivered over 3% organic growth, well above our expectations. Fulfilling our commitments, financial and otherwise, both internally and externally remains a top priority for this leadership team. Q2 performance was highlighted by organic growth in all four new segments. Based on the momentum in the first half of the year and our increasing confidence in the back half of the year, we are raising the full year 2023 outlook for net sales, organic sales and adjusted EPS, which Glenn will cover in a moment. We continue to execute on our transformational and strategic initiatives. The progress we are making is beginning to take shape in our results. We believe we are on the right path, driving improvement and transforming the business to deliver sustainable performance over the long term. As previously shared, we had received several inquiries about our Wellspect healthcare business from interested parties. After a thorough review of these and other alternatives, we have decided to keep the Wellspect business in the Dentsply Sirona portfolio as the options explored did not adequately reflect the value of the business. We have now commenced the incorporation of Wellspect into the operating model and we’ll share performance data as part of our investor updates. We have initiated quarterly business reviews with our second one recently held in Europe to discuss performance and strategy for each country and business group. While there, we reviewed the Connected Technology Solutions R&amp;D pipeline, which we feel is robust. Spending time with our local teams also plays a critical role in building an accountable, high performance culture. These meetings give us the opportunity to dive deeper into the business and engage with employees and customers. Additionally, in Europe, we continue to engage in productive and positive conversations with the Workers Councils regarding the restructuring plan. We are also continuing to deliver on our sustainability commitments. We have developed and launched the first sustainability educational curriculum for dentistry through the Dentsply Sirona Academy. The curriculum was developed in response to an international study Dentsply Sorona conducted in 2022 on sustainability. To complement the course, the team developed a Sustainability in Dentistry resource Kit to assist dentists in their effort. And now I’ll turn it over to Glenn to discuss our second quarter results in greater detail. Glenn? Glenn Coleman: Thanks, Simon. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today, I’ll provide more detail on our second quarter results and an update on our 2023 outlook. As Simon mentioned, we delivered top and bottom line results above expectations. The second quarter performance was highlighted by organic growth in all four segments, which coupled with favorable margins and a lower tax rate, drove better than expected adjusted EPS. Notably, the second quarter represents another quarter of delivering on our commitments. Let’s begin on Slide 5. Our second quarter revenue was $1.028 billion, representing reported sales growth of 0.5%. Foreign currency negatively impacted sales by $18 million and was larger than expected due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen and Russian ruble. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 2.3% led by continued double digit growth in our Aligners business and broad based strength in Asia Pacific led by China which grew 25%. EBITDA margins were 17.7% and were better than expected driven by leverage from higher sales and effective cost management. Year-over-year EBITDA margins were lower due to continued inflationary headwinds impacting our cost of goods sold, the higher commercial and infrastructure investments, partially offset by price increases and cost reductions from our restructuring program. Adjusted EPS in the second quarter was $0.51 and was well above expectations despite a $0.2 FX headwind. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted EPS declined by $0.18 largely due to lower operating margins. Operating cash flow was $104 million as compared to $173 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily due to changes in working capital, which was impacted by the timing of AR and AP compared to the prior year and higher operating expenses associated with commercial and infrastructure investments. In the second quarter, we returned $30 million to shareholders through dividends with a total of $207 million returned year-to-date through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Let me now turn to our second quarter segment performance on Slide 6. Starting with the Connected Technology Solutions segment or CTS, organic sales grew 2.8% primarily due to improvements in the supply chain and shorter lead times for certain high tech equipment, partially offset by softer demand in Europe. Within CTS, our CAD/CAM business declined by mid-single digits driven by lower demand in Europe, particularly in Germany along with broader macroeconomic challenges across the region. That said, underlying retail demand in the U.S. improved sequentially. The Equipment &amp; Instruments business grew high single digits, driven by improvements in treatment centers and imaging in Europe. As well as solid demand across all product categories in Asia Pacific. Organic sales in the Essential Dental Solutions segment, which includes Endo, Resto and preventive products grew 0.7%, driven by stable patient traffic in the U.S., partially offset by softer demand in Europe. We attribute a portion of the softness in Europe to pre-buying activity in the first quarter. Moving to the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment, organic sales grew 3.7%. Aligners grew double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter driven by growth in both SureSmile and Byte. SureSmile grew over 20% and continues to benefit from market share gains, regional expansion, new product offerings and differentiated outcomes. Our direct-to-consumer aligner brand Byte grew high single digits, driven by improved customer conversion rates and lower customer acquisition costs which not only drove higher revenues but also better profitability. On a full year basis, we continued to expect our Aligners business to grow double digits. Implants returned to growth in the quarter, highlighted by demand for value implants as well as growth in China due to VBP volumes and a recovery from COVID related shutdowns. Our U.S. implants declined in the quarter, but we expect to see gradual improvement for the remainder of the year. And wrapping up with the Wellspect Healthcare segment, organic sales grew 3.1% with growth across all three regions. For Wellspect, we expect to see faster growth in the second half of the year, which will include recent and planned new product launches. Now let’s turn to Slide 7 to discuss second quarter financial performance by region. U.S. organic sales grew 1.1% driven by stable demand in Essential Dental Solutions and double digit growth in Aligners, partially offset by lower sales of imaging equipment and implants. U.S. CAD/CAM distributor inventory levels declined approximately $20 million sequentially in the quarter driven by solid underlying retail demand. Distributor inventory levels for CAD Cam products remained low at the end of the second quarter relative to historical averages. Because of this, for Q3, we expect to see a sequential increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels in advance of DS World in September. Turning to Europe, organic sales declined 2% due to lower implants in CAD/CAM sales which we attribute to macroeconomic headwinds in the market and unfavorable timing of orders for Essential Dental Solutions. These declines were partially offset by continued SureSmile growth in the region. We also saw more pronounced demand softness in Germany, which is a key market for our business due to recessionary pressures in the country. Rest of world organic sales grew 11% in the quarter, driven by growth in all four segments. China and Australia posted solid growth and we also saw strong equipment demand across the region. With that, let’s move to Slide 8 to discuss our updated outlook for 2023. We’ve updated our full year outlook to reflect our performance in the first half of the year as well as our increased confidence for the remainder of 2023. While we recognize macro uncertainties cloud the economic outlook in the second half, we are seeing stable to improving patient traffic in most key markets and our execution is improving. We are increasing our outlook for the full year net sales to a new range of $3.98 billion to $4.02 billion. This represents a $75 million increase at the midpoint of the range which is now at $4 billion. We expect organic sales to grow approximately 3% which is an increase compared to our prior range of flat to 2% growth and we expect to show growth in all four of our segments. We estimate full year EBITDA margin to be greater than 18% unchanged from prior outlook. While we continue to face cost headwinds impacting gross margin we’re seeing these headwinds stabilize and expect gross margins in the second half of the year to be consistent with the first half. Given the better than expected top line performance, we’re also raising our full year adjusted EPS outlook by $0.5 at the midpoint to a new range of $1.92 to $2.02. Keep in mind that the improved outlook also includes a $0.3 FX translation headwind. Overall, we’re pleased to be raising our adjusted EPS outlook for the second consecutive quarter. Our first half performance gives us even more confidence that we’re on the right path towards achieving our target of $3 adjusted EPS in 2026. For the second half of the year, we expect organic sales growth to be approximately 3% with Q3 growth below 3% and Q4 growth above 3%. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to grow mid-teens year-over-year but be lower sequentially due to seasonality. A return to earnings growth in the third quarter would mark an important milestone in our turnaround story. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Simon. Simon Campion: Thank you, Glenn. Moving on to the strategic update starting on Slide 9. Let me start by reaffirming our strategy, to transform dentistry by digitalizing dental workflows, driving product and service innovation and delivering an exceptional customer and patient experience through an engaged and diverse workforce. In order to fulfill our strategy, we must focus on a simple, more secure and connected workflow experience that our clinic and lab customers trust to deliver better treatment journeys and patient outcomes. We are making meaningful progress executing on the strategy as we remain intently focused on our objectives. Slide 10 shows the 2023 and beyond strategic objectives which I first shared with you at the start of this year. Our five core tactical and strategic objectives are to, one, deliver on our annual growth and margin commitments, two, enhance and sustain profitability, three, accelerate enterprise digitalization, four, win in Aligners and implants and five, create a high performance culture. We continue to leverage and expand our operating model to regularly monitor and measure performance and drive progress against these objectives, which we believe has already begun to translate into better business performance. Turning to Slide 11 for an update on our objectives. Starting with the goal to achieve our annual growth and margin commitments, we now have consecutive quarters where we have exceeded our commitments and delivered a better than expected first half of the year. While there is still much work to do, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver consistently on our commitments. In February, we announced the new operating model and restructuring plan. We have acted with urgency and have made meaningful progress on the transformation work, with workforce reductions largely complete in regions outside of Europe. Our SKU rationalization plan continues to advance with pilots well underway in Europe and the U.S. and a project team in place to oversee execution. Additionally, there are other opportunities to enhance and sustain profitability through network and operational simplification initiatives with four locations in the U.S. already in the midst of transferring to other locations in our network. Enterprise digitalization is critical to our success and we remain focused on accelerating it both internally and externally. We are advancing our multi-year ERP implementation project with the internal team assembled and the blueprinting or design phase already underway. We also continue to add capability to DS Core. Over the past two quarters, new functionality has been added to enable more efficient communication between dentists, labs and patients, improve the efficiency of CAD/CAM practice workflows and broaden the range of services to include SureSmile and the Lab. Winning in Aligners and Implants is another important strategic objective. In the new structure, these businesses are now combined into one segment. In Q2, the Aligner business delivered another quarter of double digit growth, highlighting the momentum and traction we have gained in this category. Byte continued to deliver top line growth and enhanced operational performance with higher customer conversion rates, effective patient engagement and lower customer acquisition cost. SureSmile continues to drive market recognition and growth through our differentiated offering, particularly in the GP channel. Our offering is now available in 55 countries, representing most of our key markets across the globe and we continue to demonstrate the benefits of SureSmile and evaluate investment opportunities to enhance our footprint in certain geographies. In Implants, we have reactivated our investment in clinical education after a prolonged period of underinvestment in this area. In Q2, we hosted the Implant Summit in Athens, Greece, which brought together more than 400 clinicians for three days of hands on peer-to-peer learning and engagement. Customer feedback from the event was very positive. Additionally, we continue to focus on performance in the Implants business and recognize there is more work to do. In the U.S., we are seeing some green shoots with a number of new accounts coming online in the last quarter. Globally, our value implants offering MIS has shown consistent growth. In China, the Implants business gained strong traction during the VBP program rollout. The incremental volume since implementation has exceeded our expectations and we now expect that volume will more than offset the pricing headwinds for the full year. Lastly and importantly, I would like to touch on the work we are doing to create a high performance culture here at Dentsply Sirona. This is critical to enable achievement of our other strategic objectives and foundational to driving long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Our new operating model continues to evolve and take shape, providing clarity, efficiency and putting the customer back at the center of everything we do with compliance at the forefront. It gives meaning to the KPIs implemented to diligently run the business and hold ourselves and each other accountable. You can expect to keep hearing these things from us because they stand out as core to our operating model and principles. We’ve also continued to build out the leadership team. Last quarter, I announced that a new SVP of Quality and Regulatory Affairs joined the team, a newly created role elevating quality within the leadership team. Most recently in mid-July, we brought in a new HR leader who along with the rest of the leadership team will play an instrumental role in driving high performance culture throughout Dentsply Sirona. We also hosted the top 100 DS leaders in Charlotte during the quarter. This meeting, the first since 2019, helped us further align on our operational objectives and transformation, drive our winning culture and reinforce our commitments to ethics and compliance. Now let me close with a few remarks on slide 12. As a reminder, 2023 is a transition year. However, Q2 represented another quarter of improved execution, which provides increased confidence in our outlook. As an organization, we believe we are making significant progress on our transformational and strategic initiatives and we’ll pivot as warranted to pursue our goals. Achievement of the goals, coupled with more normalized marking conditions, will position Dentsply Sirona to grow revenue in line with the market while also increasing profitability. The combination of these positive factors can position Dentsply Sirona to deliver meaningful earnings improvement with adjusted EPS of $3 targeted in 2026. While we have talked a lot about cutting costs, we recognize the criticality of leveraging some of these released funds to invest smartly in our business with a focus on ROI to drive long-term growth. As I said earlier, it’s not just about bringing great products to the market, we must also actively invest in customer engagement, clinical education and sustainability. As previously announced, our Investor Day will be on November 9th in Charlotte. We look forward to sharing more details about our strategy and road map at this event. And with that, I will open it up for questions.

We will now conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&amp;A roster. Our first question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk about how you sort of see the progression of the gross margin over the rest of the year? You obviously had a little step up in the quarter. I think you previously talked about maybe 100 basis points for the third quarter. So just sort of if you could talk about maybe or if you can’t talk about it quantitatively if you could sort of talk about the puts and takes on that line? Thank you very much. Simon Campion: Yes, Elizabeth, thanks for the question. If you look at the first half of the year, gross margins, we did something around 56.7%, a little bit higher sequentially from Q1 to Q2. We expect it to be pretty consistent in the back half of the year. So I would just say second-half of the year very consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. And we’re still dealing with inflationary pressures. I think the good news is they are starting to subside, but I think we’ll see a better improvement in gross margins moving into next year. On EBITDA margins, we do expect to see a meaningful improvement in our EBITDA margins really in the fourth quarter, so sequentially I’d expect EBITDA margins to go up slightly from Q2 and then a much more meaningful increase in -- from Q2 to Q3 and then more meaningful increase in Q4. So EBITDA margins, we are expecting a much larger jump and that’s because of the restructuring savings kicking in in the back half of the year. Elizabeth Anderson: Got it. That was very helpful. And as a follow up, can you talk about, I know the macro has been excitingly ever changing this year and I appreciate your comments about China et cetera in the quarter. Can you talk about sort of how July progressed and sort of what you’re seeing currently in the U.S. and Europe and China? I know China obviously had the lockdown, your comments on the rest of the world would also be helpful. Thank you. Simon Campion: Yes. In terms of July trends, I would just say no significant changes from what we saw in the second quarter. We did have some growth in the month of July, but keep in mind. July sequentially coming off of June is a big drop off, especially in Europe. So when you look at our Q3 guidance, well, it’s up year-over-year in terms of organic growth. We said it’s a little bit less than 3%. Sequentially, we expect Q3 to be down largely driven by the seasonality factor in Europe. So make sure you consider that in your numbers. But July trended exactly in line with our expectations down sequentially but, up slightly year-over-year continue to see stable patient volumes even in spite of a challenging external environment. I would just say that our Ortho business performed really well in July, so that was good to see. But again it’s still just one month in the quarter and our guidance for Q3 reflects what we saw in the month of July and again guidance for Q3 would suggest less than 3% organic growth down on a sequential basis and if you do the math on that, I would say somewhere on 975 would be the revenue number for Q3. And then EPS, we do expect to see mid-teens growth year-over-year, which is good to see. We’re finally talking about positive numbers year-over-year. And based upon that color, I would just say the EPS number is probably around $0.47 to $0.48. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on Q3. Operator: Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael Cherny: All right, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I can just start on the segments. I’m not sure if this is too early or something we should wait till Analyst Day for, but is there any color you can give on how we should think about growth across the segments that’s embedded in guidance in the remainder of the year and how we should think about the run rate and I guess the medium term, long term, whatever time frame we want to use outlook for the four new segments?. Glenn Coleman: Yes, Mike, this is Glenn. I would just say we haven’t given specific guidance on the segments other than, we did make comments that we do expect to see organic growth in each of the four segments. So I would just say, from a color perspective, that’s all we’re willing to say at this point. When you look at the faster growing segments, obviously Implants and Ortho obviously are one of the fastest growing segments. So that would be one where you’d expect to see faster growth. But at this point, we’re seeing positive trends across all four segments. We expect growth and look for Ortho and Implants to probably go a bit faster than the other three segments. Michael Cherny: Got it. It’s helpful start. And then I guess maybe on the Ortho side, there’s been a lot of variability over the last few quarters now, but especially this quarter in terms of the reported growth rates, obviously off very different bases. How do you see, I’m thinking more on the professional side, but happy to touch on Byte as well, but where the current competitive dynamics lies and I guess the areas where you’re winning the most opportunity versus the areas where you still think you have the most room for further penetration or improvement?Simon Campion: Yes. Good morning. So, Ortho again performed extremely well and SureSmile in particular, I would say globally, it performed very well. We’re now in over 55 countries. Europe had a tremendous performance and excess of 50% growth in Europe on SureSmile and we’re winning in the in the GP arena. That’s where we’ve been focused on. We are also in the process of equipping our Ortho reps with scanners as we focus on scanner penetration too. So SureSmile is a critical component of our business, has been and will continue to be. We expect to launch some additional simulation tools in the back half of the year. We also expect on the Byte side which is another solid quarter of growth to launch Byte Plus as we roll towards the end of the year which we feel will help drive more patients into the GP channel and so they can actually become patients, not just for the Byte aligners, but also for other preventative and restorative care in the GP space. So, an area of intense focus, a lot of investment and as we said in our prepared remarks, we continue to evaluate opportunities to invest in commercial channels for our Aligner business on a global basis. Michael Cherny: All right, thanks. Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please proceed. Jeff Johnson: Thank you. Good morning guys. Congratulations on the continued progress. Glenn, you touched on it in one of your answers here just recently on a little bit on the cost saving sides. But out of the $200 million that you’re planning over the next several years, can you just remind us what so far is run rate into the P&amp;L? And I think more importantly, as you’ve reactivated some of that Implant training doubling down here on some of the clinical education, the ERP progress is starting to happen. Just remind us, the phasing maybe of that $200 million in savings over the next one, two, three years, does the bulk of it come in year one versus year two and three and how much initially of those savings should we expect to be offset by some of these added investments here at least in the short intermediate term? Thanks. Glenn Coleman: Hi, Jeff, thanks for your comments. First, I would say we’re on track to our restructuring plans with annualized savings of $200 million to $225 million. That will be realized by mid-2024, so most of the savings would come next year. For 2023, what we said was we’d achieve about $0.30 of savings from the restructuring program. That’s about $85 million. But to your point, we are investing a lot of that back into the business, commercial infrastructure, whether it be North America Implants, DSOs, a lot of investment in clinical education, the ERP system, compliance and qualities, to name a few. We basically said that those investments would consume about $0.25 of the $0.30 in terms of the restructuring programs, only the $0.5 would flow through this year in terms of the restructuring program. In terms of where we are, the headcount actions have essentially been taken across all countries outside of a few in Europe and those are obviously complex in terms of the multiple workers council approvals that we have to get through. And we’ve also got to get some additional non headcount savings in the back half of the year. But on the whole, everything is progressing as we would expect. If you look at the first half of the year versus second-half of the year for 2023 and the meaningful improvement in the back half of the year, both in terms of EBITDA margins and EPS, so, we did $0.90 of EPS in the first half midpoint of our guidance, which suggests a dollar seven in the back half. Over two thirds of that improvement in EPS is expected to come from the restructuring savings kicking in the back half of the year. So hopefully that gives you a lot of color on what we’re expecting this year and then obviously as you move forward to next year, we should see another meaningful increase. In the restructuring savings, we haven’t yet laid out how much of that is going to be offset by investments next year, but clearly there will be a nice pull through when we look at 2024. Jeff Johnson: All right and hopefully this doesn’t count as my follow up, but would you expect those investments to be less as a percentage of the cost savings next year, so more of the cost savings can flow through. But then the follow up question I do want to ask is just on Europe, what’s your just, maybe, sign and your update on state of the economy there? I think your comments this quarter were maybe a little more guarded, obviously leading that to economic indicators have not looked great. Obviously, you have a pretty sizable exposure to Germany with the Sirona legacy business so maybe it’s all equipment, but what is patient demand looking like there? How concerned are you about maybe the next six to twelve months? Is that something that you think Europe could really see a consumption issue from a general standpoint? Is this just an equipment sluggishness right now because of Germany’s macro? Just how to think about the lay of the land in Europe right now? Thanks. Glenn Coleman: Well, thanks. Sure. So Jeff, just like we did for the last two quarters, we ran our survey and we got about 450 responses from Europe, about half of those came from Germany. And I would say sentiment in Germany with customers is muted and has deteriorated versus the prior survey. Especially around capital equipment and indeed around patient volumes, let’s say the other geography that is a watch out for us and others I’m sure is Australia and New Zealand. They’ve also, their sentiment has also declined but in the other countries in Europe, the UK is stable, France is stable, Italy is stable. So it’s really centered around, the negative sentiment that we that we found in our survey is primarily centered around Germany and Australia, New Zealand with everywhere else stable to modest improvement very modest improvement.Jeff Johnson: That’s helpful. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please proceed. Kevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. You talked earlier about winning some new accounts in Implants. I know you had made some investments in Implant sales force. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what kind of clients you’re winning on the Implant side and the Implant dynamics that you’re seeing in the U.S., in Europe and in China, the differences between the markets right now? Glenn Coleman: Yes, so let me start with the shining light Kevin, which is China. We had a tremendous quarter in China on implants. We now strongly believe that we will offset the price degradation with volume as we head into the back part of the year. Clearly we’re winning in MIS there in the mix. The mix is also favorable for us in China, so all very positive in China. I would say in the U.S. we’ve made those investments as we went into the early part of this year in the sales team and now in Q2 not only have we got the e sales team together for training, we also invested in that 400 person session in Greece and other sessions like it. We have we had stepped away, the company had stepped away from investments in the Implants business and clinical education in particular over the past number of years and I think as I shared on the last call the Implantologists view themselves as a family and we had moved away from that family, but we’re now reengaging. And it’s, sentiment is positive from these customers as a result of this. I would say with the type of customers that we are winning, it’s -- I would say, it’s too early to get any trends from that. Obviously, we monitor this on a religious basis each and every month. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks that there are green shoots in terms of the engagement of our reps, the number of customer visits they are making, some of the positivity from customers and also from their referral dentists because that’s part of the challenge that we have here. It’s not just calling on the implantologist. We also need to get to their referring dentists as well, which is the heavy climb that we have faced. But as Glenn said in his remarks, we do expect progress in Q3 and Q4 and expect to see growth for the year in implants. So, we’re heading in the right direction we feel, but it’s -- we’re a long way from thinking we have the job done. Kevin Caliendo: If I can ask you a quick follow-up. DS World is coming up, we’re all anxious to see your -- you guys running your first DS world and I know that when you took over, you were -- you looked at some of the R&amp;D projects that were in the pipeline and I think maybe got rid of some of them or changed up sort of the R&amp;D model. How much of this DS World would you say is stuff that you’re -- that you put in place and how do you think, from an R&amp;D perspective, where does investment need to come going forward? Like where would you want to be focused going forward? Simon Campion: So I would say, a year into our tenure here. You don’t make changes in terms of products sitting in the street within a year. The life cycle is longer than that, but what we have done is install the processes around R&amp;D, so that we can accurately assess the potential return on it and accurately assess the timing of commercial launches. And so, they are the processes that we have built around and we have consolidated our R&amp;D efforts around fewer programs that we focus on ROI. We have a robust process now for valuation and we will be, as I mentioned in an early response, we will be launching new products over the next number of months. You’ll get sight on some of them at DS World and then further into Q4 and Q1. So, it’s very much a work in progress on the R&amp;D side and it’s, I would say, no projects that we have kicked off will have -- will see the light of day here for the next several months, but the process is more robust. Kevin Caliendo: Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Jonathan Block with Stifel. Please proceed. Jonathan Block: Thanks guys. Good morning. The outperformance for the first half of 2023 and Glenn, I think as you mentioned, you’re obviously taking up the implied 2H as well by really a decent clip. But Glenn, what are the areas of the overall business that deviated the most to the upside, call it, versus your expectations when you guided whatever that was six, seven months ago? I’m guessing Aligners might be one of them, but maybe you can elaborate and give a little bit more detail and then I’ll pause and ask my follow-up. Glenn Coleman: Yes. I would say, regionally, it’s been in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. So, in the U.S., consumables have done better than our initial expectations. I think the retail demand has also been stronger for certain CAD/CAM equipment, which we haven’t yet seen in our numbers, so that’s encouraging as well. In Asia Pacific, obviously, we mentioned China. China has now been outperforming even some pretty robust expectations for the back half of the year. So I think China will continue to do well and actually outperform our initial budget, if you will. We’re seeing better recovery in imaging and treatment centers as well and a lot of that is improvements in the supply chain. We’ve significantly reduced lead times and so really good work by our global ops team on doing that, and that’s helping us to overperform there.And so those would be the areas coupled with what you mentioned earlier, which is Aligners. Aligners continues to do really well, really strong double-digit growth for us, both SureSmile and Byte and so those are the areas of outperformance. On the EPS front, the volume benefit from these higher sales is obviously helping us overachieve. We got a slightly higher restructuring savings in the first half of the year as well. The ortho profitability doing better than we had expected because of the outperformance there and then a lower tax rate. So I think on the whole, that’s how we look at the first half of the year. And we’re very pleased with how we started the year and looking forward to continuing it in the back half. Jonathan Block: Okay. Great color, thanks for that. And maybe I’ll try to ask sort of two quick ones. Simon, strategically on the scanner, you talked about some good results there and maybe you’re bundling with the Aligners. Are you -- where you want to be strategically, in other words, do you think you need, call it, a lower end scanner when you’ve seen what’s going on with some of the prices out there? And then if I can try to jam in another question. You started the year organic sort of flattish, you’re now at 3%, but the EBITDA margins remain, call it, greater than 18%, so where are those additional dollars, where are they being earmarked and going in terms of investments? And maybe just talk to us about the return time line on those dollars? Thanks guys. Simon Campion: Yes. So on the scanner side, with PrimeScan, we’re obviously a premium scanner with great technology available. And we did launch PrimeScan Connect in the September time frame last year. We had a really strong quarter in Q2 on PrimeScan Connect in fact, scanners, I think we had the second biggest quarter in six on unit sales in scanners and on mills. So we adapted some price on the PrimeScan Connect. So that’s not, I would say, an upper mid-value scanner that has resonated. We had traction in Europe, traction in Japan so scanners, we are pleased with the quarter, but we’re not pleased with where we are in the market and we are intently focused on bringing next-gen scanners to the marketplace. And as I mentioned, DS Core continues to be a really important aspect of our business moving forward. We brought new incremental capability to that in Q2 that will continue throughout this year and next year and any new technology that we bring out will obviously be integrated into DS Core and leverage the cloud. So that’s where we’re around scanner and equipment, and I’ll let Glenn handle the other part. Glenn Coleman: Yes, Jonathan, on the EBITDA margins, we have not updated our guidance since the beginning of the year. We’re on track to be greater than 18% EBITDA margins. And if you look at where we are investing, I would say, on the commercial side, North America implants, the return on that will come, I believe, probably later this year, Q4, most likely but that return should start to be felt here in 2023. The investments in DSOs we’re already seeing the top line improvements there. We do expect DSOs to have faster growth in the overall corporate average for the full year 2023. So that’s looking promising. The clinical education investments that we’re making on the implant side, on the Endo side, again, you don’t see an immediate payback for that, but we would expect to see that probably in 2024. The ERP investments take longer, the returns on those will take us multiple years to get to but an investment we have to make now if we’re going to have a sustainable, profitable long-term business. And I would just say, given the strong start to the year, we’ve made some additional investments in certain R&amp;D programs and certain commercial areas outside the U.S. So for example, because we’re overachieving, I’ve just given the green light to go forward and add some additional reps and commercial footprint in Japan for our Ortho team, where we see a nice opportunity. And the returns on that will be 2024. I’ll actually have a hit in 2023, but we’ll definitely see returns in 2024. And so I’m going to do some things in the back half of the year here while still hitting our commitments but really setting us up better for next year. We want 2024 to really be an inflection year for us both in terms of top line performance and in terms of EBITDA margins and EPS. And so given the good start we’ve had to this year and what we’re seeing for this full year, I think we could do more while still hitting our commitments and setting ourselves up for better performance next year. Thanks for your question. Jonathan Block: Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Hi, this Is Sara on for Nate. I just wanted to dig into the 25% growth we saw in China. So how much of that was VBP volume uplift versus underlying traffic improvement and the compares? And then how was traffic trending throughout the quarter? I’d just be curious to get a sense of your expectations for China over the back half of the year. Glenn Coleman: Yes. So in terms of our performance in China, let me just try to summarize the overall situation. I’m not sure we’re going to have the level of detail that you’re asking for. But I think, first and foremost, our China business represents about 3% of our consolidated sales to put that into perspective. We did have year-over-year growth of 25%. Sequentially, we actually even grew faster from Q1 to Q2 and a lot of that was driven by these VBP volume increases in implants. Implants had really strong growth above the 25%. And Simon made some comments earlier. We expect that the volumes now will actually offset the price erosion on a full year basis, which is very positive for us overall. As we move forward, I would expect to see really healthy growth in Q3 and Q4 coming out of China, at least double-digit growth in both of those quarters.And just to give you some perspective on the second quarter here, implants had a really strong quarter. We saw growth across all product categories, except for imaging. So the one area that we’re still being cautious on is the equipment side in China, both imaging and CAD/CAM but on the whole, between the COVID recoveries, between what we’re seeing in terms of our share gains in VBP and it’s both on the public and private side, we feel really good about the momentum we have there. Simon Campion: I would just add on the -- on our server data from China, where we had over 250 respondents. They are reasonably bullish about the next three to six months. Though their patient levels are -- their offices are not yet full, but they are improving quarter-over-quarter or survey over quarter – survey-over-survey. Unidentified Analyst: Really helpful, thank you. And then just on imaging, we saw strength from the supply recovery in the quarter. But if we exclude this impact, can you discuss like the underlying business performance? And then how are you thinking about imaging throughout the back half of the year? Glenn Coleman: Yes, no, we were pleased with the imaging performance as well as treatment centers. Both Europe and Rest of the World had really strong, robust double-digit growth in both of those categories. A lot of it was the improvements I mentioned earlier on supply chain and shortening lead times. If we look at the rest of the year, we’re still cautious on imaging. So I would say, right now, I’m still expecting to see some pressure on imaging in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, and that’s what’s built into our guidance. So we’re not expecting to see a rebound, the high cost of financing, we think will likely impact some of this in the back half of the year in certain markets, including Germany, so, we’re going to be cautious on the equipment forecast going forward. It’s one of the reasons why our second half of the year guidance relative to first half of the year is flat to down when you look at half-to-half performance. And so if that turns out to be better, that’s going to be upside for us. But right now, we’re being very cautious on the equipment environment until we see better signs overall. Thanks for your question. Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Justin Lin with William Blair. Please proceed. Justin Lin: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to touch on guidance a little bit. The EPS guidance raise factoring the 3 points of FX headwind, I think, essentially just passes through the beat in the quarter that, obviously, you’ve raised yourselves much greater than the beat. Can you maybe just talk about kind of your thought process behind the guidance here? Glenn Coleman: Yes. Listen, I think this is our second guidance raise. We’re only halfway through the year. We did pass through the outperformance here in the second quarter. To your point, we are seeing higher FX headwinds right now. So we’re absorbing those in this increased guidance range that we’re providing. And again, if you look at the back half of the year, there are certain areas where we need to be careful about relative to getting ahead of ourselves. So, if you look at the Germany market, Australia, we’re being cautious there. I want to see the momentum we have coming out of DS World. We’re expecting to have a great event, and I’m hoping that we actually get some upside from the U.S. team coming out of the September event. So, still some things to see before we get too bullish on the year but in terms of EPS, we still have a lot of investments to make in this business ,we still got to get the infrastructure to where it needs to be having a solid foundation across the company. And like I mentioned earlier, I’m going to take some of this overperformance and try to do some things that I think will position us even better for next year. And so I’m looking at areas and opportunities, Simon mentioned these reviews that we’re doing regionally. Coming out of the last region review, we gave some additional dollars to certain sales leaders to go and get better top line performance for next year. And we have more planned coming up here later this month in Asia Pacific, as an example, and I’m planning on probably having a similar conversation. So one of the benefits of us actually overperforming on the top line is we can probably do some more investments to position us better for next year. But on the whole, we’re very happy with the first half of the year performance, both top line, EPS, EBITDA margins, and we’re moving forward. Justin Lin: Got it. That’s very helpful. I guess we haven’t really talked about Primeprint for a while, I feel like. Can you talk about how the product is gaining traction relative to your expectation and whether you’ve seen any sort of short-term hit to Prime mill, some doctors may see 3D printing as a replacement for mills in your practices. Simon Campion: Yes. So I’ll start with the second part of your question, Justin. We see printing and milling as extremely complementary. Printing does not, in our opinion, have the capability for permanent crowns, but more facilitates implants, temporary crowns, et cetera, et cetera, that’s our opinion. And we’ve been sharing it with customers and potential customers and we think it does resonate, and we have a strong printer offering, a strong resin offering and a great mill offering. Now with respect to our performance, I would say we are doing okay in the marketplace today. Our device is very efficient. We believe it’s got a great safety profile in the sense that it doesn’t expose the clinicians or technicians or the office to resins or fumes and the fact that it’s linked up to DS Core and other technologies as well.We think it’s a competitive advantage for -- we continue to invest in new materials, new material capability and we expect as we roll through the next six to nine months that our ability to compete with other vendors in this space that we will begin to level out the playing field as we bring some of these new materials to bear on that marketplace. So, we are bullish about the future of printing. We think it’s complementary to milling and that our complete technology offering coupled with DS Core will continue to be meaningful for customers, and we will certainly be driving it in that manner. Justin Lin: Very, helpful. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Please stand by for our final question. Our final question comes from Michael Petusky with Barrington Research. Michael Petusky: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. And I’m going to sort of throw out a bigger-- I think philosophical question. So Simon, you’ve almost been in the chair for a year at this point. Obviously, a number of people have in that chair over the past decade have not been able to create sort of sustainable momentum and sustainable value -- a sustainable value-creating business. Just curious, what are two or three things now that you’ve been in the chair almost a year that you’ve sort of looked at and you said, ""You know what, okay, I see where my predecessors maybe ran into some problems or these are some things that, obviously, we’ve as a business, historically, have not been able to get done."" I mean are there things that you’ve learned at this point where you can sort of see, hey, this is why predecessors have not quite executed and here’s why I think we can? Thanks. Simon Campion: Well, I don’t know if I want to comment on what they -- what predecessors did and did not do. I’d rather focus on what we are doing. Michael Petusky: Sure. Simon Campion: So I’ll pick some of the things that we’ve spoken about at this meeting or at this call this morning. So, one, investment in commercial infrastructure and clinical education, we have reinvested, I think, significantly in that space. Number two, building capability around R&amp;D, particularly, around uncovering innovation, monetizing it and discipline around the R&amp;D process. The big gap for us, and we’re prepared to grab that thorny bush is ERP. We have thirteen or fourteen ERP systems in this company that drives massive inefficiency. So we -- as we noted in the prepared remarks, we have kicked off that project. We have selected the vendor we have selected the integration partner, we’ve built a team around it, and we’re in the blueprinting phase. We are reducing our network, our manufacturing and distribution network, so there are a lot of levers that we are pulling why others did or did not pull the same levers, I don’t know, but we have our -- we have a full plate and we’re making progress in all regards. In addition to the cultural transformation, we’re building out the team and we’ve elevated quality. We brought in a new CHRO leader, we’ve changed out the leadership in Australia and New Zealand. We’ve put the customer at the center of everything we do. In addition to driving a culture of ethical and compliant behavior, which we think is -- which we know is extremely important and we drive that at every single meeting. In fact, at the top 100 leader meeting that we had in Charlotte, the first presentation on the agenda was ethics and compliance. So we are not screwing around. It’s really important. Michael Petusky: All right, very good. Thank you so much. Operator: Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Simon Campion, CEO, for closing remarks. Simon Campion: Thank you, and thank you all for your attendance on today’s call. I would just like to take a moment to reiterate some key points before we close. Firstly, delivering on our commitments is of the utmost importance to this team. We feel that operational execution is improving at Dentsply Sirona. We continue to make advances on the transformational and strategic objectives that we’ve laid out. We are, as we’ve spoken about, investing back into our business, which has been funded in part by our cost savings initiatives. And then finally, on behalf of the management team, I want to thank all Dentsply Sirona employees for their dedication to the business and the necessary transformation that is underway. And in particular, we want to express our thanks to employees who have departed the organization in the last quarter and wish them all well in the next phase of their careers. Thank you. Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.In comparison, US-based Micron Technology, which is banned by Chinese authorities from selling certain products to some local clients, last month announced samples of its high-bandwidth memory 3 (HBM3) Gen2 die to support generative AI applications. Samsung Electronics said last month it has completed development of GDDR7 DRAM for AI applications, and it will double down on high-bandwidth memory in 2024 to meet growing demand in AI applications. Meanwhile, rival SK Hynix, which tops the global HBM market with a 50 per cent market share, is also set to double its HBM production next year for AI servers.Analysts and industry professionals told the South China Morning Post that Micron, Samsung and SK Hynix remain the default choice for many downstream buyers and that Beijing's restrictions on Micron, which previously had about a 15 per cent market share in China's server DRAM market, mostly benefited its two South Korean competitors.Story continues""The premier choice of replacement for Micron is still Samsung [and] SK Hynix,"" said an executive at a memory controller producer, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.China's shortcomings in storage capacity would hinder the country from making the most of its massive data resources in AI development, Ni Guangnan, a Chinese semiconductor expert and an advocate for China's semiconductor self-sufficiency, told the World Semiconductor Conference Expo in Nanjing last month.Big Tech Chinese firms from Baidu and Post owner Alibaba Group Holding to Tencent Holdings and JD.com are eager to develop generative AI models amid a heated global AI race, creating a black market for Nvidia GPUs such as the A100 and H100. However, Ni said the importance of data storage is often given less attention in China as the primary focus is on computing power.Top-tier AI server GPUs have set a new industry standard by primarily using high-bandwidth memory, according to a research note by TrendForce. HBM, a type of advanced DRAM optimised for AI innovation, is only manufactured by Micron, Samsung and SK Hynix.The YMTC logo is seen on an iPhone next to the Chinese flag in this illustration photo. Photo: Shutterstock Images alt=The YMTC logo is seen on an iPhone next to the Chinese flag in this illustration photo. Photo: Shutterstock Images&gt;China has kept its cards close to its chest regarding its latest technologies, leaving the outside world to guess how far it is progressing in Beijing's self-sufficiency drive. YMTC, for example, has not updated its website news page since October 2022. The company has resorted to local tool suppliers to keep up with its advanced 3D NAND production as strict US export controls have made it harder to go beyond 128 layers, the Post reported previously.While these locally-made memory chips are suitable for consumer electronics, they may fall short if used for AI servers. Brady Wang, an associate director with research firm Counterpoint, said China has to buy advanced memory chips from South Korean and Japanese suppliers as server memory chips often have a higher requirement than consumer-facing products.""If [China] insists on using domestic products for security reasons, it would mean compromise on the quality [of servers],"" Wang said. He added that it would be hard for YMTC and CXMT to rely purely on the domestic supply chain for their technology development when global peers have access to the best available equipment.In the China market, YMTC has about a 3 per cent share in NAND flash sales, with US sanctions damaging yields on its advanced NAND chips, while CXMT holds a 21 per cent share of DRAM manufacturing capacity, the highest among Chinese DRAM makers, according to TrendForce.However, the Hefei-based company maker, whose best offering is DDR4 DRAM, is still trailing several generations behind its international competitors in terms of technology.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Jim Cramer Stock Picks This Week.Love him or hate him, it's a fact that Jim Cramer's stock picks and commentary gain a wide attention. Cramer is always ready to provide hints on possible winners and losers His commentary is often bold and his bets often blunt, without any fear of being proven wrong. While many investors follow his stock picks, others opt to trade the inverse of what he recommends. The formation of an inverse Jim Cramer strategy whereby investors trade the opposite of what the CNBC commentator suggests is becoming increasingly popular.Betting against Cramer's recommendations would have yielded a year-to-date return of 15%, barely beating the market by half a percentage. Investors who have traded the inverse of the commentator's recommendations have enjoyed a return of up to 22% over the past year. Some of the stocks that have generated significant returns in the inverse Cramer strategy include C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).However, Cramer has been right in his calls on several occasions. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of his top picks for the year. The stock has gone on to gain more than 40% year to date on benefiting from the tech bull rally.Cramer has also been bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a stock that has taken the market by storm, tripling in value and becoming a trillion-dollar company. Other top performers in his portfolio include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which have posted more than 40% yearly gains.Cramer also has an edge in calling out big winners outside tech.

(NASDAQ:BIIB), Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A).Story continues11 Jim Cramer Stock Picks this WeekCramer recently warned of the need to be extremely cautious on stocks that continue to rally on the back of no solid underlying fundamentals in what he deems a frothy situation.The CNBC commentator is also staying clear of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), insisting that the drug maker faces increased competition and regulatory pressure for its lead products such as Keytruda. Cramer's Trust has also exited its position on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on concerns about the legal issues that the company faces with its baby powder and talc products. The analyst is also downbeat about Verizon and sees little growth.Our methodologyWe have compiled a list of stocks Jim Cramer believes have a significant upside potential compared to their peers. The stocks were picked from the CNBC commentator's recent shows on Mad Money, where he interacts with callers providing insights on how he believes different stocks will perform. We ranked the stocks based on the upside potential which was calculated on the basis of average analyst price estimates for these stocks.11. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Upside Potential: 8.89% Price target: $92.44According to Cramer, PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) is a great American company for anyone looking for some exposure in the auto industry. The stock has already rallied to its 52-week high after gaining more than 35% year to date.The rally comes at the back of an impressive record of positive earnings surprises. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) has not missed earnings consensus over the past four quarters, having delivered earnings of $2.25 a share for Q1 against $1.82 a share expected.At the start of the second quarter, PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) inked a strategic partnership with Toyota to develop Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks powered by Toyota Hydrogen fuel cells. Wall Street is overly optimistic about Paccar with Ana's verge price target of $92.44, which implies an 8.89% upside potential.10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Upside Potential: 8.88% Price target: $75.22According to Cramer, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a worthy stock to own for gaining some exposure in the burgeoning semiconductor sector. With the company looking to push the envelope in the AI memory market with its product development, it boasts tremendous potentialAccording to Cramer, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is well-positioned to benefit from the global chip shortage as it has a significant supply that meets demand from various sectors, including gaming, computing, and smartphones.In addition, the CNBC commentator believes the chip giant is trading at a cheap valuation compared to its peers, thus, well poised to benefit amid the AI fueled rally.According to the analyst, buying Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) on weakness would be an ideal play. The stock commands a $75.22 average price target implying an 8.88% upside potential.9. U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)Upside Potential: 8.94% Price target: $64U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) has outperformed the market in 2023 despite being a seasonal stock over the years. The stock is already up by more than 30% for the year, and Cramer believes it still has significant upside potential.There were concerns that U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)'s core business of renting trucks, trailers portable moving storage units would be hurt by more people opting to remodel houses instead of moving. However, that has yet to be the case.The storied do-it-yourself specialist benefits from moving activity bouncing back to historic trends.According to Cramer, U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) is an inexpensive stock that should continue increasing. The stock commands a $64 average price target implying 8.94% upside potential.8. Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL)Upside Potential: 10.42% Price target: $57.55Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) is another regional bank under immense pressure amid the banking crisis early in the year. The stock imploded from $71 a share to $26 per share in three days in March after the Silicon Valley bank blew up. The sell-off came amid concerns that the bank's depositors were fleeing.Fast forward, the bank's genuine deposits grew significantly in the second quarter, shrugging any concerns of a bank run. According to Cramer, the 50% run from 2023 lows is justified, and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) is well poised to continue edging higher, considering it is still down from its highs. Wall Street expects the stock to rally by 10%, going by the $57.55 average price target.7. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Upside Potential: 12.94% Price target: $70.42Marvell Technology, Inc.

Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION)Upside Potential: 13% Price target: $42Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) is another regional bank that Cramer remains confident about as it continues to pick its pieces after the banking crisis.Like Western Alliance, Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) has had net inflows of deposits.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the burger restaurants and fast food industry, you can go directly to 5 Best Burger Chains in the US.In one of our recent articles, we briefly discussed how the US ranked among the 20 Countries with the Best Food in the World. Today, we will be looking at some of the most reputable and successful burger chains in the country.Over the years, burgers in the US have become a cultural phenomenon. A wide variety of burger chains in the country continuously try their best to perfect their burgers using high quality items and ingredients while also offering tall, juicy, and tasty burgers.Burger Restaurants Market and the Fast Food IndustryBurger restaurants and chains in the US are once again in full swing as the fast food industry recovers from the COVID-19 crisis and shifts their focus towards growth. While the COVID-19 crisis proved to be disastrous overall for the fast food industry, some burger chain restaurants in the US remained open throughout the pandemic. These burger and fast food chains offered pick-up and delivery services and the convenience of low priced burger meals during the pandemic prevented the fast food industry’s revenue from falling at a much faster rate.Many of the fast food chains in the US were still forced to close huge numbers of their locations in the country after the start of the pandemic. However, the fast food market has recovered and continues to show promise as the demand for fast food is on the rise. Burger restaurants continue to represent a huge segment of the fast food industry. According to IBISWorld, there are now more than 91,000 Burger Restaurants Businesses in the US in 2023. Heightened demand for burgers and other ready-to-eat meals remains one of the key drivers anticipated to push the global fast food industry towards growth. According to Expert Market Research, the global fast casual restaurant market was valued at $189.7 billion in 2022. The market is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% during 2023-2028 to reach a value of around $364.52 billion by the end of the forecasted period.Story continuesSome burger chain stocks that are expected to become a popular choice as the demand for fast food rises include McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), and The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN).On July 27, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), which ranks among the largest burger chains in the world, reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $3.17 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.38. The company reported a revenue of $6.50 billion and beat revenue estimates by $202.69 million. On July 27, Reuters also reported that the shares of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) were up 1.5% after the giant burger chain posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales as it continued to attract consumers to its locations. However, the corporation announced that inflation had begun to cool down prompting the burger chain to bring down their pricing levels, and this could potentially curb their revenue growth. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and other burger restaurants as well as fast food chains previously had to increase their prices because of high levels of inflation, but this proved to be highly profitable for some of the chains when prices of commodities like beef and dairy eased down.However, easing of inflation and lower levels of prices could positively influence the burger restaurant market as it is anticipated to attract even larger numbers of customers. Burger chains around the world seem ready to make good use of opportunities like these through collaborations and promotions. On July 13, CNBC reported that Restaurant Brands International Inc.’s (NYSE:QSR) giant burger chain, Burger King, in Brazil unveiled a Barbie themed burger meal and took to social media to announce their collaboration with the blockbuster movie.Moreover, the rising demand for burgers and fast food, especially in the US, has raised the competition within the burger restaurant sector to unprecedented levels. On August 2, Reuters reported that some of the biggest fast food chains are pushing towards new technologies to automate production, lowering labor costs, and possibly increasing their profit margins. It is no secret that technology and digitization can help improve the customer experience by providing better service, faster delivery, and accurate orders. Many burger chains in the US, with the aim to increase their sales and improve guest experience, are already encouraging customers to use self-service kiosks, and also to place their orders online through their apps or websites. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a prime example of fast food restaurants that are pouring into their digitization initiatives. Here are some comments from McDonald's Corporation’s (NYSE:MCD) Q2 2023 earnings call:“In our top six markets, digital sales represent nearly 40% of system wide sales and our loyalty members remain highly engaged with over 52 million 90 day active members across our top six markets. As our relationships with these customers continue to grow, we will unlock additional customer needs and explore investments for continued digital innovation at a scale that only McDonald's can achieve.”Now that we've provided some insights into the burger business and the fast food industry, let's take a look at some of the best burger chains in the US.20 Best Burger Chains in the USMethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of the 20 best burger chains in the US using consensus picks from QSR Magazine, Eat This Not That, Restaurant Clicks, Thrillist, and Mashed. We calculated the number of times each burger chain is listed in these sources and calculated the aggregate position of each of these chains according to their position in each of the sources. Choosing the best burger chains requires a number of factors to be taken into consideration and it can still be a matter of personal preference.

(NASDAQ:TRIP) By 30%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-tripadvisor-inc-nasdaq-120821288.html,1691323701,STORY,['TRIP'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Tripadvisor is US$23.53 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityTripadvisor is estimated to be 30% undervalued based on current share price of US$16.36 The US$19.10 analyst price target for TRIP is 19% less than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Tripadvisor The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$179.9mUS$247.6mUS$210.0mUS$249.3mUS$264.3mUS$277.1mUS$288.3mUS$298.2mUS$307.3mUS$315.8mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.02%Est @ 4.85%Est @ 4.03%Est @ 3.45%Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.77% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.7% US$164US$206US$159US$172US$166US$159US$150US$142US$133US$125(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.6bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$316m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.7%– 2.1%) = US$4.2bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.2b÷ ( 1 + 9.7%)10= US$1.7bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.2b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$16.4, the company appears quite good value at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tripadvisor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.283. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Cramer is always ready to provide hints on possible winners and losers His commentary is often bold and his bets often blunt, without any fear of being proven wrong. While many investors follow his stock picks, others opt to trade the inverse of what he recommends. The formation of an inverse Jim Cramer strategy whereby investors trade the opposite of what the CNBC commentator suggests is becoming increasingly popular.Betting against Cramer's recommendations would have yielded a year-to-date return of 15%, barely beating the market by half a percentage. Investors who have traded the inverse of the commentator's recommendations have enjoyed a return of up to 22% over the past year. Some of the stocks that have generated significant returns in the inverse Cramer strategy include C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).However, Cramer has been right in his calls on several occasions. Apple Inc.

Other top performers in his portfolio include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:BIIB), Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

(NYSE:MRK), insisting that the drug maker faces increased competition and regulatory pressure for its lead products such as Keytruda. Cramer's Trust has also exited its position on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on concerns about the legal issues that the company faces with its baby powder and talc products. The analyst is also downbeat about Verizon and sees little growth.Our methodologyWe have compiled a list of stocks Jim Cramer believes have a significant upside potential compared to their peers. The stocks were picked from the CNBC commentator's recent shows on Mad Money, where he interacts with callers providing insights on how he believes different stocks will perform.

PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Upside Potential: 8.89% Price target: $92.44According to Cramer, PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) is a great American company for anyone looking for some exposure in the auto industry.

Wall Street is overly optimistic about Paccar with Ana's verge price target of $92.44, which implies an 8.89% upside potential.10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Upside Potential: 8.88% Price target: $75.22According to Cramer, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a worthy stock to own for gaining some exposure in the burgeoning semiconductor sector. With the company looking to push the envelope in the AI memory market with its product development, it boasts tremendous potentialAccording to Cramer, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is well-positioned to benefit from the global chip shortage as it has a significant supply that meets demand from various sectors, including gaming, computing, and smartphones.In addition, the CNBC commentator believes the chip giant is trading at a cheap valuation compared to its peers, thus, well poised to benefit amid the AI fueled rally.According to the analyst, buying Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) on weakness would be an ideal play. The stock commands a $75.22 average price target implying an 8.88% upside potential.9. U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)Upside Potential: 8.94% Price target: $64U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) has outperformed the market in 2023 despite being a seasonal stock over the years. The stock is already up by more than 30% for the year, and Cramer believes it still has significant upside potential.There were concerns that U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)'s core business of renting trucks, trailers portable moving storage units would be hurt by more people opting to remodel houses instead of moving. However, that has yet to be the case.The storied do-it-yourself specialist benefits from moving activity bouncing back to historic trends.According to Cramer, U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) is an inexpensive stock that should continue increasing.

The sell-off came amid concerns that the bank's depositors were fleeing.Fast forward, the bank's genuine deposits grew significantly in the second quarter, shrugging any concerns of a bank run. According to Cramer, the 50% run from 2023 lows is justified, and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) is well poised to continue edging higher, considering it is still down from its highs.

(AMEX:EQX) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript August 3, 2023Operator: Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to Equinox Gold's Second Quarter 2023 Results and Corporate Update. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Rhylin Bailie, Vice President, Investor Relations for Equinox Gold. Please go ahead.Rhylin Bailie: Thank you, [Gillian], and thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. We will, of course, be making a number of forward-looking statements today. So please do visit our continuous disclosure documents on our website, on SEDAR and on EDGAR. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Greg Smith.Greg Smith: Thanks, Rhylin and good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today, especially at this very early hour on the West Coast here. On the call with me is our COO, Doug Reddy, our CFO, Peter Hardie; our EVP of Exploration, Scott Heffernan and our VP of Investor Relations, Rhylin Bailie, who you just heard from. As a quick introduction to those new to the company, Equinox is a diversified Americas-focused gold producer. We have 7 producing mines across Brazil, Mexico and the United States, and we also have several growth projects, including our large-scale Greenstone Gold mine in Ontario, which is in construction now with our 40% joint venture partner, Orion Mine Finance. So today, we're discussing our 2023 second quarter financial and operating results.But before we jump into those results, I just want to acknowledge the fatality at our Santa Luz mine in June. This was a tragic incident, and we extend our deepest sympathies to our employees, family, friends and coworkers. We had a 1-week site-wide suspension of operations at Santa Luz to facilitate the investigation and to refresh safety training. I'll now start with a broad overview for the quarter, and then I'll turn over the call to Pete and Doug for more details. We had a solid quarter with sales of just over 138,000 ounces at a cash cost per ounce sold of $13.61 and an all-in sustaining cost per ounce sold of 1502. For the first 6 months of the year, we sold 261,000 ounces at cash costs of $13.54 per ounce and all-in sustaining cost of $15.76 per ounce.Story continuesThis reflects record sales for the company for the first 6 months of the year, and we remain on track to meet our 2023 production and cost guidance. On Tuesday this week, we issued a press release with a full Greenstone update. For those that didn't see it, the team at Greenstone has done a great job of continuing to advance the mine on time and on budget for first gold pour in the first half of 2024. As of July 21, we were 85% complete overall at Greenstone. There's loads of pictures on the website, and you can really see how far the projects come and advance over the course of this year. And Doug will have more to say on Greenstone in a few minutes. During the quarter, we also continued to progress the feasibility study on the addition of an underground mine at Aurizona.And we're going to continue to conduct some additional work, including trade-off studies on throughput from the underground mine. This means we'll complete the study next year. This timing also allows us to proceed with construction of a portal and a decline, which we plan to include in our capital budget for 2024. Our work so far shows excellent potential for a long-life underground mine in Aurizona. So we're keeping our foot on the gas in terms of development while we progress the feasibility study. And Doug will also comment more on this. We finished the quarter with unrestricted cash balance of $174 million, plus approximately $170 million available from our credit facility for a total of over $300 million in available cash liquidity at quarter end.With cash flow from operations, this leaves us well funded through the completion of construction at Greenstone. We also published our third comprehensive ESG report in May. And just recently in July, we published our first water stewardship report. These reports summarize our performance during 2022, our targets for 2023 and our long-term strategy across a range of ESG initiatives. They're both available on our website along with our climate action report, and I encourage everyone on this call to check them out. So with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Peter Hardie to run through our financial results.Peter Hardie: Thanks, Greg. We're now on Slide 6 in the presentation. From a gold sales and revenue perspective, we had our best first half of the year in the company's history. During the quarter, -- for the 138,000 ounces we sold, we received an average realized price of $19.62 per ounce. That's $19.31 year-to-date, generating $217 million in revenue, $506 million year-to-date. We sold 15,000 more ounces in Q2 as compared to Q1 of this year and about 18,000 more ounces than we did for the 120,000 ounces that we sold in Q2 last year. Our cash cost per ounce of $13.61 for Q2 is similar to that of Q1 of this year and down from Q2 of last year of $14.82. Our all-in sustaining cost per ounce of Q2 this year of $15.02 is down from Q1's $15.76 and also down from Q2 last year, last year's $16.57.As to forward views on input costs, unit prices, we're now starting to see decreases in particularly diesel and cyanide in Brazil and the U.S. Those unit cost decreases in Brazil are somewhat offset by the strength of the Real against the U.S. dollar. Our EBITDA in Q2 2023 was $64 million or $71 million on an adjusted basis, and we had net income of $5 million for basic and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.02. On an adjusted basis, we had a net loss of $6 million or $0.02 a share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $81 million or $0.26 a share. Included in that cash flow from operations is a receipt of an additional $10 million from the gold prepaid arrangement. If you back out those funds, we generated $71 million in cash flow from operations or about $0.20 a share.In terms of liquidity and capital position, we ended the quarter with $174 million of unrestricted cash and $127 million available to draw on our credit facility, giving us total liquidity of a little over $300 million. We did draw the remainder of the revolver on August 1. And -- further to the gold sale prepaid transactions entered in Q1. As I mentioned, we did enter into an additional gold sale prepay on June 23, whereby with one of our -- one of the members of the syndicate that provided the prepay, we received $10 million in exchange for delivering to the lender, 263 ounces of gold per month from October 24 to July 26 for a total of just under 6,000 ounces. Those terms reflect -- and that delivery period reflects that of the prepay that we did earlier in the year.Concurrent with the execution of the gold prepay sale transaction in June, we entered into financial swap agreements that fixed the gold price relating to that $10 million at $21.09 per ounce. Net debt increased from $113 million at the end of Q1 to $548 million -- pardon me, going from $548 million to $661 million at the end of Q2. On Slide 7, what does that mean for Greenstone? Based on progress to date, we believe our share of the remaining construction budget is about $170 million, and we expect to fund that through our cash that we had to the end of the quarter, our operating cash flow and the final draw on the revolving credit facility. Additionally, we still have the $100 million accordion feature in place. And with those sources of liquidity, as Greg mentioned, we believe we're well funded to complete Greenstone construction.With that, I will turn the time over for Doug to review the operations.Copyright: tomas1111 / 123RF Stock PhotoDoug Reddy: Thanks, Pete. So as mentioned earlier, we had a very good first half of the year, and we are looking at pushing hard to deliver strong production in the second half. We've noted before that about 55% of production this year is in the second half of the year. have Mesquite. The Brownie pit provided a majority of new ore, about 90% of the ore going to the leach pad and re-leaching on portions of the pad also contributed significantly to the Q2 gold production. Mining costs at Mesquite benefited from a drop in diesel prices. And just, for example, the current price is about 30% lower than it was in Q2 last year. Process costs were reduced through a reduction of cyanide and lime usage. We don't see that staying the same in the second half because we plan on stacking more in the second half.So the overall cost will go up on cyanide mine. At Castle Mountain throughput has increased 40% since the start of the year in the crusher and the crusher run time is up by about 30%. We continue with modifications to the crusher setup and we're planning for those additional modifications to be implemented in Q3. At Los Filos, productivity improvements were seen in both open pit and underground. Open pit has about 15% higher productivity, along with loading improvements and an increase in effective operating hours. For underground is about 23% increase in the ore tonnes being mined. So although we -- but although we have more tonnes going to the leach pad, we did have some challenges on the leach pad that we've been addressing. These include some higher copper ore coming from the Guadalupe open pit.I do note that this is only a portion of the ore, and it represents about 12% of the tonnes being stacked for the remainder of the year. We also had issues with solution management related to some broken pipes in one area of the pad. Those have since been repaired and the pregnant solution in that area where the breakage occurred needs to be drained. That impacts about 8,000 ounces that is slow in coming out of the pad. It will come out. It's just going to be slower to get coming out than originally anticipated. And we also had one portion of the leach pad, which had to be turned again and leached again after a carbonate precipitation occurred, which was hindered recovery. That impacts about 4,000 ounces. Again, those ounces will come out in the second half of the year.At Aurizona, -- in addition to the current mining contractor, we also mobilized a second contractor with articulated dump trucks. They'll be in for most of the rest of 2023. They came in during the rainy season. The rainy season is over now. We're putting a big push on the mining and to establish a larger stockpile in advance of the next rainy season. At Fazenda, we're currently mining mostly from open pits while the underground also catches up on development, and we'll work on bringing additional stopes into production. Drilling continues on the reserve replacement program at Fazenda. It's been successful every year, and we continue doing that to get successful in replacing reserves every year. At RDM, we had good performance from the owner-operated fleet.That fleet is a combination of our own trucks plus 15, 60-ton rental trucks -- the increase in mining of higher grade ore has brought the production up significantly in the quarter. And the mill feed is -- I'll note that mill feed is also being augmented with low-grade stockpile if there is any availability in the mill. At Santa luz, the team continues to gradually bring recovery up, and the plant had an average overall recovery of 67% in the quarter. We are targeting 70% or better for the remainder of the year, and the team continues to work on process and throughput improvements. So moving on to Greenstone. I get the pleasure of being able to speak about a really good story on construction progress, and the team has done a great job. We put out the Greenstone update news release on Tuesday and provided a complete summary of the project status.Essentially, the project is on budget and on schedule for H1 2024 production. Moving on to the next page, looking at progress. Overall progress at Greenstone is 85% complete, which is comprised of construction at 83% complete, engineering is 100% complete and procurement 87% complete. Capital spend at June 30 is $937 million, which is 76% complete of the budget on a 100% basis. And we have approximately $170 million remaining as Equinox Gold's share to fund through to project completion. Facilities handed over to operations so far are the permanent effluent water treatment plant, truck shop, warehouse, sewage treatment plant, potable water treatment plant, the pit and plant site fuel stations, reagent storage building and site mix emulsion or explosive plan.The Ministry of Transport Petrol Yards been turned over to the ministry and the dismantling of the [ Oppatrol ] yard is now complete. Highway 11 realignment is also complete and has now been transferred to the ministry and was open to the public a few days ago. And the natural gas pipeline to site has been commissioned and is now operational. Plant site is 75% complete. The TSF is 80% complete. Operations are now at 240 employees. We'll get to around 360 employees by year-end. We look forward to hosting an analyst and investor visit in early September. And now moving on to our other expansion projects. At Castle Mountain, the -- we continue in permitting. We've responded to queries from BLM, and we anticipate permitting being complete in 2025.In the meantime, it continues with engineering work and with [indiscernible] to support the Phase II of Castle Mountain. At Aurizona, as Greg mentioned, we've been advancing the engineering studies, and these incorporate additional drilling and the recent work looked at the underground mining at a higher production rate given the large scale of the underground resource. And we see benefits in continuing to advance our studies on operating with both open pit and underground to concurrently fill the plant. So we are looking -- we are planning on developing an exploration decline in H1 2024, which would provide us an opportunity to develop down to one of the ore zones, mine in the ore zone and enable collection of geotechnical and hydrogeological information on ore and Wallrock.The plan is to have a fully dimensioned decline that would serve as a production access and would also enable a rapid start to underground production when we've completed our additional studies. And then at Filos, we continue to assess the opportunity to invest in CIL, but we do remain focused on having the right climate in Mexico and within the region before committing to the major investment. And while we also have competing opportunities for capital investment on other projects. So with that, I'm going to hand it back to Greg.Greg Smith: Thanks, Doug. I think I'll just make a final comment here to thank the entire Equinox Gold team in Vancouver and at all of our sites as well as our shareholders and other stakeholders for their continued support.

If you want to skip our introduction to the stock market and growth investing, then head on over to 5 Oversold Growth Stocks To Buy. Growth is one of the most popular words these days. Whether it's growth in the job market, growth in inflation, interest rates, or the economy, analysts and economists keenly reading any new data set to see what the tone will be for the stock market over the next couple of months.Right now, GDP growth is one of the hottest topics in the market, since this metric might be the one that ends up providing the Federal Reserve with more leeway in raising interest rates. Currently, interest rates in America are at multi-decade highs, and the central bank has started to slow down the pace recently as it evaluates whether the economy can withstand more pressure without contracting significantly and causing large losses. America's GDP grew by 2.4% in Q2 2023 which provided the Federal Reserve with some relief as it could take comfort in knowing that high interest rates have not been as damaging as initially feared. The strong GDP growth has also made big ticket banks, such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, revise their earlier estimates of a potential recession in America.Growth investing involves taking high risks with the hope of even higher rewards. As opposed to value investing, where the main goal of the investor is to gauge a differential between the implied and actual share price of a firm and take advantage if the former is higher, growth investing focuses on those companies whose shares are valued higher on the market than their book value might suggest. For the uninitiated, the book value of a stock is simply the firm's liabilities deducted from its assets and it is the value that the shareholders of a firm will receive in the unfortunate case of a liquidation. The book value is an important indicator in stock analysis as it provides an estimate of the true worth of an investment or a stock and therefore becomes a benchmark with which market prices are compared to determine under or overvaluation.Story continuesIn growth investing, the fundamental premise is that even though the book value of a company might be lower than its market price, over time it will grow due to strong market performance. Subsequently, it is not for the faint of heart and requires patience and holding the shares over a long time period to benefit from share price growth. Apart from the book value, another important financial ratio that is used to sift out growth stocks is the price to earnings ratio. While the book value, often converted into the price to book value per share, sees the current payout to a shareholder, the price to earnings ratio measures the valuation premium for a firm in the stock market compared to the money that it earns after expenses, taxes, and other obligations are deducted. The higher the P/E ratio is, the more the market expects the firm to grow its earnings in the future and this optimism is reflected in the share price.To pick out growth stocks, one can either use the P/E and P/B ratios to make the decisions or leave the stock picking to the professionals and use an exchange traded fund (ETF). An ETF is simply a collection of stocks that issues its own shares and is operated by a broker or another financial firm. There are dozens of ETFs for growth investing, and some with the lowest expense ratios are Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NASDAQ:VONG), iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:IMCG), Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:VOT), and iShares Morningstar Small-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:ISCG).Another way to pick out stocks, particularly if one cannot be bothered with analyzing a firm's fundamentals and its book value, is technical trading. Within this framework, one tool is called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This index measures the upward and downward movement in a share price over a time period (generally 14 days) and allows investors to determine if excessive market sentiment is driving the stock up or down. However, the utility of the RSI goes beyond this, since it can also be used to signal whether a bearish or bullish market is on the horizon. This is typically when the RSI fails to move in line with the share price and does not cross previous highs or lows. For instance, the share price might be going up but the RSI might fail to set new overbought levels, in what is generally thought to be a bearish indicator.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top oversold growth stocks to buy.

I'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.tanker, energy, oilKanok Sulaiman/Shutterstock.com Vicki Hollub: Thank you, Neil, and good afternoon, everyone. There are three things I'd like to drive home today. First, our portfolio of assets continue to set the table for record results. Second, our teams outperformed last quarter's and last year's excellent operational metrics. And I want to make sure our investors see how that flows to the bottom line. Third, our strategic and operational improvements continue to support our ability to take actions to drive even better shareholder returns. I'll begin with the portfolio. We had the highest quality and most complementary assets that OXY has ever had. They are a unique blend of short-cycle, high-return shale assets in the Permian and the Rockies along with lower decline, solid return conventional reservoirs in the Permian, GoM and our international assets. 60% of our oil and gas production is from shale reservoirs and 40% from conventional. More than 80% of our production is in the United States. The international oil and gas assets that we operate are in only three countries, Oman, Abu Dhabi and Algeria. Our worldwide full year 2023 production mix is expected to be approximately 53% oil, 22% NGLs and 25% gas and 70% of the gas is in the United States. Our conventional oil and gas sets, along with OxyChem provides support during low price cycles while the shale assets provide the opportunity for growth during moderate and high price cycles, and the flexibility to adjust activity levels quickly if needed. This combination of assets has generated record cash flows for Oxy over the last couple of years versus the cash flow generated by the portfolio that we previously had in a similar price environment from 2011 to 2014. The midstream business provides flow assurance and has done so with exceptional performance during catastrophes and emergencies. The low carbon ventures business will help Oxy and others decarbonized at scale in a way that provides incremental value to our shareholders. To summarize, we have a deep and diverse portfolio, providing the cash flow resilience and sustainability necessary to support our shareholder return framework throughout the commodity cycles. Let's shift now to operational excellence. Strong second quarter operational performance exceeded the midpoint of our production guidance by 42,000 BOE per day, enabling us to again raise full year production guidance. In the Rockies, outperformance was driven by improved base production and new well performance, along with higher-than-expected non-operated volumes and the receipt of accumulated royalties. Our Rockies teams drilled 32% faster on a foot per day basis than they did in the first quarter. The team's diligent work set several new Oxy records, including company-wide record of drilling over 10,400 feet of lateral in only 24 hours. Just 10 years ago, it took the industry an average of 15 days to drill 10,400 feet. Our Permian production delivered higher operability and better-than-expected new well performance, particularly in our two new drilling space units in New Mexico, top spot in precious. Our Delaware completions team shattered OXY's previous record for continuous frac pumping time by nearly 12 hours for a total of 40 hours and 49 minutes. Four years ago, the same job would have taken about 84 hours. 40 hours back then was unthinkable, but our teams have made this a reality. We expect that the efficiencies generated by advancements in drilling and completions pumping will result in lower cost and reduce time to market. Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, we safely completed seasonal maintenance activities focused on asset integrity and longevity. Excluding the impact of this planned maintenance, we delivered higher base production and benefited from improved uptime performance across multiple platforms. Internationally, our teams continued to deliver strong results. The Al Hosn expansion came online two months earlier than planned. as a result of great teamwork with our partner, ADNOC. This means that together, we have now successfully expanded the plan in stages from 1 Bcf a day to 1.45 Bcf a day or a very small incremental capital investment. In Oman Block 65, we drilled a near-field exploration well, which delivered 6,000 BOE per day and a 24-hour initial production test, and it is now on production to sales in less than a month from completion. This was our highest Oman initial production test in the decade, and we continue to show the benefits of our subsurface characterization techniques worldwide. We were awarded the block in 2019 and in collaboration with the Ministry of Energy, we are positive about opportunities in the country where we are the largest independent producer. OxyChem also outperformed during the second quarter due to greater-than-expected resilience in the price of caustic soda and reductions in feedstock prices. OxyChem is one of our valuable differentiators. It provides rich diversification to our high-quality asset portfolio by consistently generating quarterly free cash flow which provides a balance of our oil and gas business throughout the commodity cycle. Now I'd like to talk about how our focus on operational excellence is enhancing our portfolio and extending our sustainability to maximize near- and long-term shareholder returns. OXY's wells are getting stronger and are supported by our deep inventory, which continues to get better. In the Permian, we have improved well productivity in 7 of the last 8 years. And with the application of our proprietary subsurface modeling, we're starting to see the same results in the DJ Basin, where improved well designs have delivered reserves at roughly 20% less cost. The improved well design has resulted in about 25% improvement in single well 12-month cumulative volumes over the last five years. And we are on pace to significantly exceed that rate in 2023. In addition, our teams are continuing to advance our modeling expertise, which has led to upgrades of secondary benches to top-tier performers. This was the key for our 2,000 -- sorry, 212% U.S. organic reserves replacement ratio last year. Let me try to make that point again. Last year, because of these upgrades to our secondary benches to our top-tier benches, we were actually able to replace our production by 212% with reserve adds. Secondary bench upgrades are progressing in 2023. Overall, in 10 of the last 12 years, we have replaced 150 to 230% of our annual production. The only exceptions being in 2015 with a price downturn in 2020 with a pandemic. Converting lower-tier benches to top tier will further extend our ability to achieve high production replacement ratios. Not only are we adding more reserves than we are producing each year, we're adding the reserves at a finding and development cost that is lower than our current DD&amp;A rate, which will drive DD&amp;A down and earnings up. Our differentiated portfolio and the strong results delivered by our teams provided support for execution of our 2023 shareholder return framework. During the second quarter, we generated significant free cash flow, repurchased $425 million of common shares and have now completed approximately 40% of our $3 billion share repurchase program. Common share repurchases, along with our dividend enabled additional redemptions of the preferred equity. To date, we've redeemed approximately $1.2 billion of preferred equity. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Rob Peterson: Thank you, Vicky, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter, we posted an adjusted profit of $0.68 per diluted share on a reported profit of $0.63 per diluted share. Difference between our adjusted reported profit was primarily driven by impairments for undeveloped noncore acreage and deferred tax impacts from the Algeria production sharing contract or PSC renewal, partially offset by an environmental remediation settlement. In the second quarter, strong operational execution enables to are over $1 billion of free cash flow for working capital despite planned maintenance activities across several of our oil and gas businesses. Following nearly $1 billion of preferred equity redemptions and premiums, $445 million of settled common share repurchases and approximately $350 million relate to LCVs investment net power, we concluded the second quarter of approximately $500 million of unrestricted cash. We experienced a positive working capital change during the second quarter primarily driven by reductions in commodity prices and fewer barrels in shipment over quarter-end. Interest payments on debt are generally paid semiannually in the first and third quarters, which also contributes to a positive second quarter working capital change. During the second quarter, we made our first U.S. federal cash tax payment this year of $210 million and state taxes of $64 million, which were netted out of working capital. We anticipate a similar federal cash taxes will be made in subsequent quarters this year, those state taxes are paid annually. Our second quarter effective tax rate increased from the prior quarter due to a modest change in our income jurisdictional mix. The proportion of international income, which is subject to a higher statutory tax rate grew during the second quarter. We are therefore guiding to a minimum adjusted effective tax rate of 31% for the third quarter as we expect our effective tax rate going forward will be more closely aligned with the second quarter rate. I will now turn to our third quarter and full year guidance. As Vicki just discussed, our technical and operational excellence continues to drive outperformance across our oil and gas businesses. This enables us to raise our full year production guidance midpoint to just over 1.2 million BOE per day in anticipation of a strong exit to the year. Rockies outperformance serves the largest catalyst to our full year production guidance raised and is also a primary driver of the slight change to our full year oil mix guidance. Reported production in Rockies is expected to reduce to its lowest point this year in the third quarter before beginning to grow in the fourth quarter. In the Gulf of Mexico, we were guiding slightly lower production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to a contingency for seasonal weather. The third quarter weather contingency as well as planned maintenance opportunities brought forward to reduce oral downtime are expected to result in our highest domestic operating costs on a BOE basis this year when normalizing to less than $9.50 per BOE in the fourth quarter. Internationally, we expect higher production compared to the first half of 2023 due to planned turnaround and expansion project timing at Al Hosn as well as impacts from various international production sharing contracts. As we have previously mentioned, the increased international production will be slightly offset by the new Algeria PSC, which decreased reported production, but the reduction in imported barrels is not expected to have a material impact on operating cash flow. Overall, the first half of 2023 was characterized strong production in Gulf of Mexico, Permian and Rockies, with latter two businesses also benefiting from nonrecurring production events. We have better anticipated wells and time-to-market momentum year-to-date, which we expect it to be benefiting from in the second half of the year, the third quarter will be the only quarter in the year where we production average is below 1.2 million BOE per day. Reduced production is mainly driven by the previously mentioned weather contingency implies to the Gulf of Mexico. The decrease in third quarter production will likely result in total company production is lower in the second half of the year when compared to the first. However, the change in expected production does not represent a shift in our volume trajectory. We anticipate fourth quarter production will be similar to the first two quarters of 2023, and we expect to enter 2024 with a strong production cadence. Furthermore, our full year guidance implies our fourth quarter output of approximately 53%, largely due to improved GoM production absence of third quarter weather contingency. Shifting now to OxyChem. As anticipated in original guidance, we continued to see weakening in the PVC and caustic soda pricing during the second quarter. However, our full year guidance remains unchanged at a pretax income midpoint of $1.5 billion, which will represent our third highest pretax income ever in another strong year for OxyChem. We also expect our chemicals business to return to a more normalized seasonality compared to recent years, meaning that the fourth quarter will represent the lowest earnings for the year. As we have mentioned on previous calls, the fourth quarter is typically not a reliable roll forward for the year ahead through the inherent seasonality of the business. We revised our full year guidance from Midstream and Marketing due to expected market changes over the second half of this year. The margins generated by shipping crude from Midland to the U.S. Gulf Coast are expected to compress further following the annual FERC tariff revision, which has increased our pipe cost approximately $2.55 a barrel. Over the same period, the price we market long-haul capacity is expected to decrease. Additionally, we anticipate fewer gas market opportunities as spreads across multiple basins have continued to narrow and find opportunities generated in the first quarter. Also, pricing for sulfur produced a holding is expected to soften in the second half of the year. Capital spending during the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion. We expect capital to decrease slightly in the third quarter with a more pronounced reduction in the fourth quarter. The expected decrease was primarily driven by reduced working interest and growth activity in the Permian, which is in alignment with our original business plan. We anticipate receiving $350 million during the fourth quarter associated with the second quarter environment remediation settlement. While this settlement will drive our reported overhead down, our full year guidance to overhead expense on an adjusted basis remains unchanged. Turning now to shareholder returns. As Vicki mentioned, we further advanced our shareholder return framework during the second quarter through the repurchase of $425 million of common shares, which enabled additional preferred equity redemptions. After a strong start in the first quarter, we triggered the redemption of over $520 million of preferred equity in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we've been approximately $1.2 billion or 12% of preferred equity that was outstanding at the beginning of the year with 10% premium payments to the preferred equity holder of approximately $117 million. Preferred equity redemptions to date have resulted in elimination of over $93 million of annual preferred dividends. As of August 2, rolling 12-month common shareholder distributions totaled $4.08 per share. Due primarily to the concentration of share repurchase in the third quarter of 2022, coupled with the current commodity price curve, it is likely that the cumulative distributions will fall below the $4 per common share during the third quarter. If we drop below the $4 redemption trigger, our ability to begin redeeming the preferred equity, again, will heavily be influenced by commodity prices. WTI prices would likely need to be higher than what the forward curve presently indicates for us to remain above the trigger for the remainder of 2023. Even if we aren't able to continue redeeming the preferred equity for a period of time, we remain committed to our shareholder term program, including our $3 billion share repurchase program. Our basic common share count is at the lowest since the third quarter of 2019, resulting in per share earnings and cash flow accretion to our common shareholders. Sustained efforts to significantly deleverage over the past several years have improved our credit profile, culminating a return to investment-grade status when the Fitch ratings upgraded OXY in May. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings reflect our exceptional operations, diversify the high-quality asset portfolio and our commitment to pay down debt as it matures. Our second quarter results and our full year guidance demonstrate solid progression towards another strong year for OXY. We look forward to reporting on additional progress in the year again. I will now turn the call back over to Vicki. Vicki Hollub: Thank you, Rob. Before closing today, we'd like to briefly mention two low carbon ventures announcements that we made this week. We were glad to announce that Japan's ANA Airlines became the first airline in the world to sign a carbon dioxide removal credit purchase agreement from our subsidiary, 1.5. We're excited about that and happy to work with them. We're also pleased to announce a first-of-its-kind agreement with our long-standing partners, ADNOC, to evaluate investment opportunities in director capture and carbon dioxide sequestration hubs in the U.S. and the UAE. With this agreement, we intend to develop a carbon management platform that will accelerate our shared net zero goals. We have many exciting developments taking place in LCV, and we look forward to providing you a more comprehensive update towards the end of this year. With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Douglas Leggate : Vicki, I wonder if I could focus on productivity which your latest slide deck is showing -- you refer to it as the wedge wells with a quite frankly, stunning step-up in performance relative to prior years. My question, I guess, is the repeatability of that and the impact on how you think about your strategy? Because to summarize, you've suggested you would not seek to grow production meaningfully, if I'm interpreting that correctly. But this productivity would suggest that either you're going to grow production as you did with your step-up in guidance or you're going to cut your capital budget to hold the production at a flatter level. So I'm curious, are you prepared to take the production? Or is it going to get more capital efficient with lower CapEx? Vicki Hollub : Well, we intend to keep our capital plan as we had it or at least the activity plan as we had it. I can tell you, Doug, I'm incredibly impressed with what our teams have done I've been in this industry for a very long time, and I've seen a lot of extensive work done to model conventional reservoirs over the years. And when we started our shale development, some thought it was more of a statistical play where you just go drill wells and maybe 25% of them would be really good and 75% would be okay. But we took the time in 2014 to step back and say that we were going to put together a team that could do the kind of work that needs to be done in shale. It's much more complex than conventional. So we really focused on trying to make sure that we put together a team that could do the most sophisticated work on the subsurface possible, and they've done incredibly well. And I would say, in the past two to three years, I was thinking that we were getting close to plateauing on our learnings and what we can do. But the teams continue to surprise me, continue to go beyond what I thought we would ever be able to do in this industry with respect to not only understanding the subsurface as well as we do, but also being able to understand how to get the most oil out of it. And -- so where we are today is, I've now asked the teams to stop talking about it. We -- for years, we're sharing things that we were doing, and we've shared some things on the slides in the slide deck, but they had prepared a lot more to share with you today to highlight and map out the pathway that we're using to get to where we are. But it's just too important to our company, it's -- and to our shareholders to keep that proprietary because this is something that's pretty phenomenal, I think. And now we're taking this, and we're going to apply it to the Permian -- I mean to the Powder River Basin. We're using it. They've done incredibly well in the Permian. We've also taken learnings from the team in the DJ and moved those through the Permian. So we're sharing ideas across business units. The next one will be the Powder River Basin, where while we did take an impairment on some noncore areas, they -- we are excited about the Powder River. And I think Richard will say a little bit more about that later. But the Southern Powder River is, we're seeing good results there. And our appraisal team is beginning to work in the northern part of the Powder River. And we're going to take it also the same sort of concept about how to do it, we want to take to other areas within OXY. And we think that by using a similar methodology with what our phenomenal team in the Gulf of Mexico has been able to do. They've done amazing things in terms of being able to see below-the-salt and to improve our success rate there. But I think you put this subsurface team for our shale development, but the approach they take, the methodology that they use with the ideas that our GoM team has generated and start really exploiting the various strengths. I think we take this and apply it to conventional reservoirs and applying this to conventional with the expertise that we have working those conventional reservoirs today, I think that there would be even more cross flow of learnings from conventional to shale and shale and conventional I think it's beyond what anybody in the industry that I've seen or heard about it is doing today. So with that said, to get back to your question on capital and production, we're going to execute our program looks like it is going to result in a production increase, and we're happy with that. We never said that we didn't want to grow. We just don't want growth to be the target. But the target is value creation. And that value creation comes from doing the developments when we're ready to do them at the pace that generates the most net present value. And our teams are doing that, and they're doing it incredibly well. So we'll take what we're getting here. Douglas Leggate : I've got a very quick follow-up, and it's kind of hard back to something we've talked about before, which is the legacy Anadarko portfolio. We know it dips in the second and perhaps the third quarter. My question is, when you rebound out of the fourth quarter as is ordinarily the case in that profile, have you lost any production capacity? Do you -- what do you think the production capacity is today? And presumably, those are the highest margin assets in your portfolio. I just wonder if you could confirm that so we can anticipate what happens to earnings and cash flow in Q4?Vicki Hollub : Yes. The legacy Anadarko assets in the Texas, Delaware are really, really top tier. We had -- when we were working to do the acquisition, we knew that they were really good we thought they would come in and be almost equal to our Southeast New Mexico, and I'm going to get myself in trouble here. I think they were, I thought, for a while better than Southeastern Mexico. I think I happen to say that in the hallway one day, and the Southeast New Mexico team decided they would prove me wrong on that. So I would say that Southeast New Mexico and Texas Delaware are both incredibly important to us. They are very high quality, and they're both a part of our program going forward. Richard, you had something to add? Richard Jackson : Yes. Maybe just to help add on to that when we talk about assets in the portfolio and even legacy Anadarko. I think the Rockies trajectory, while very strong in the first half of the year, I think what's impressive, we talked about knowing we would decline kind of through the first half of the year and then grow. And I think if you see our guide for 3Q and the implied guide for 4Q, that not only was the first half better, but the second half was better as well. And while the new wells are certainly core, how do we think about deploying capital and creating the efficiency, I'd like to also recognize all the team that works on our base production. I think the Rockies is a great example of being able to rethink our surface infrastructure, they've been able to kind of lead the industry, I think, in some of these tankless designs, but they've migrated to more efficient bulk and test. They've been able to think about artificial lift earlier, things like gas lift earlier in the cycle of the well. And a lot of that beyond creating the most EOR per dollar spent is really helping our production. And so when you look year-on-year, that base production is another one that I think we're really proud of from the teams. Vicki Hollub : No doubt, it's the Permian and the Rockies and the Rockies actually applying artificial intelligence to their pumps up there, which has been very, very impressive as well as the management of the gas lift in the Permian, Texas and New Mexico. So these are exciting things for us, and we're -- we have to definitely gets kudos to the teams. They've gone above and beyond expectations. Operator: The next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes. I'm thinking team one to start off on the return of capital. Just curious on your thoughts on the commodity price level or the oil price level at which you believe you can get back to taking out the preferred. And just in the absence of that, how aggressive can you be around buying back stock? Vicki Hollub : Well, certainly, we have the capability at almost any price environment. There's a lower limit to where we would probably not do much share repurchases at $60. But at $70, we could continue a common share purchase program. And certainly, at $75 and above, we've got the cash to do both. But what we feel like with our current shareholder framework is that share repurchases are a big part of that because our -- in common share repurchases because what we're really trying to do is we're trying to create value per share for our investors. And to create value per share, it not only means that we need to grow production a bit. Again, that's with the cash flow is the main thing we're trying to grow when we're growing production, and that's an outcome of our capital program. So this year, we will get incremental earnings growth from our incremental volumes, but also developing our reserves at the lower cost, like we've talked about and like I talked about in the script and like we've been talking about here, what the teams are doing that's so important is to develop reserves, replace our production every year by at least 130% to 150%. And again, we've seen years up to 230%, where the DD&amp;A or the funding and development cost is $6 or less in some cases. And we were able to do that with the DD&amp;A rate of what we have today versus that, that's creating value for our shareholders, creating earnings. And then the last thing is to couple with the cash flow growth and income growth from the volume creation and the reduced cost of those binding and development reserves is to buy back shares. And especially given the fact that we feel we're very undervalued right now. So share repurchases, whether or not it triggers the preferred is really important to us. But in the near term, what we'll do is we will probably wait a little period of time here to watch what's going to happen with the macro. And if the macro plays out the way we expect, we should be able to do both to buy common and to get back at some point within the next few months to doing both buying not only common, but triggering the preferred, it could take into next year before we're able to get a program going. But we do believe that we can at $75 or above, have a program that will do that. Rob Peterson: I'll just add that part of the challenge that we have is that our program last year was very back-end weighted. We did $2.4 billion of share repurchases concentrated across the second half of the year of $1.8 billion of that just in the third quarter alone. And so it's the pace at which we were able to retire shares last year, matched up against the commodity prices that we have this year, that's really making it difficult to stay with the 4 consistently. So if you go back to last year, gas pricing, we realized over $7 in Q3, oil prices were over $95 realized in Q3. And so that's the big change year-over-year that we're seeing.Neil Mehta : And then the follow-up is congrats on getting the Al Hosn gas expansion on this year. Just would love any perspective or thoughts on your Middle East business and how we should think about the incremental cash flow associated with the asset that just came online? Vicki Hollub : The Al Hosn project getting to the 1.45 Bcf a day had very little capital is definitely a good project for us. And with -- just having gotten that back on, we expect that the certainly, the production looking good towards the rest of this year from Al Hosn and also the fact that we were in Oman able to get an exploration well that was record setting for us online and to production in less than a month was another good sign for healthy production coming out of the Middle East. We do have incremental opportunities in Oman for additional wells that are similar to that in Block 65. So -- and this year, this past year, in Safah field on the North Oman. We've had production records there, and that's a field that's been in operation for over 40 years. So we're still finding new things to do there. And also, when I talk about innovation and subsurface modeling and with -- and Richard brought up the guys that are working really hard base maintenance and base production. I want to mention, too, that there's been quite a bit of innovation coming out of Oman as well, One being a process called oxygetting, where we go into -- you can do it in new wells or existing wells to go in and get through the formation and with proprietary process we use there and get incremental production, and that's part of the reason that we were able to achieve record production from that area this year. So a lot of good things happening in our Middle East operations, and we're as I mentioned in my script, focused on 3 countries, and we feel like it is best not to be spread over a lot of countries, but to we like the fact that we are here in the U.S. and countries internationally, and we'll focus on being the best we could be in those areas and eliminate or minimize distractions from anything else. Operator: The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : My question is on the Gulf of Mexico. Your production and incremental operations and continue to look quite solid. I was just wondering how would you classify just current opportunities today in the Gulf? And could we see any notable change in activity there in the coming quarters? Vicki Hollub: I would say that I have -- my thoughts about the Gulf of Mexico have actually changed a bit over the past year. Originally, when we made the acquisition, our plan was just to keep production flat and use the cash flow to invest elsewhere. I do believe now, again, based on the technical excellence of our teams working at and the fact that artificial intelligence, I believe, is going to be -- advanced data analytics, I believe, is going to be a game changer for the Gulf of Mexico. And I believe our team has the capability and expertise to optimize the use of those tools. So I think that not this year or next year, but I do believe that looking forward in the next three to five years, the Gulf of Mexico could become more of a growth area for us rather than just a cash generator. Neal Dingmann : I agree. I like the opportunities there. And then secondly, just -- you talked around this already, but maybe just a little more detail on your slide now on the DJ, maybe about just well spacing and completion design there. I'm just wondering, have your thoughts -- you guys have been ramping that up. And I'm just wondering, as you have been ramping up, have the thoughts on space or completion design has changed going forward? I think like in recent months, I believe Gaddis and other pads are what about 12-well spacing. So I'm just wondering if there's any thoughts to change any of that? Richard Jackson : Yes. Great. This is Richard. I'll try to take a few pieces of that. I mean very excited about the DJ, like I described, but the new well performance in the base. But I would say consistent with really what we've done across our reservoir positions and especially in the unconventional. It really starts with the challenge on the subsurface in terms of all the things you described, spacing, how many wells per DSU. And I think the teams continue to look at those opportunities. And as we noted, really thinking about less, I think moving from 18 to 8 to 12 wells per section allows us to deliver the same EOR for less cost. And I think just like we've done in the Permian, that's the right recipe. We have been able to use completions and really frac intensity to kind of turn up the lever to help capture those reserves without having to drill additional wells. So we've gone up to 1,500 pounds per foot, which is up about 30%, I think from our prior designs. As we think about spacing and inventory, the thing I would say is not every drill spacing unit is the same. So the geology changes, the development sequencing changes. And so there'll be areas where that may be different. I think just to kind of contrast a little bit, we highlighted the performing DSUs in the Delaware Basin, those are actually opportunities where we added wells per section. And we were able to do that again by looking at the unique kind of attributes of that drill spacing unit against the reservoir. And we're cautious with that, but we've been able to have real success, both horizontally and vertically adding those wells where it's warranted. But just the last maybe a couple of points in the DJ, again. It's sort of a holistic design that the operation's team's put together. They have done a lot to reduce time to peak production. So eliminating those surface constraints where they can really allow those wells to optimally flow. And then as Vicki described, longer term, these wells go from gas lift to plunger lift and being able to use analytics to not only be quicker in terms of our optimization, but actually predict failure mechanism so that we can deploy operations teams quicker. These are the type of things that just really excite us about how our teams approach really adding production at the right cost.Operator: The next question comes from Michael Scialla with Stephens. Michael Scialla : You talked pretty extensively about the improving well productivity, and I know a lot of companies have been talking about service costs softening here. Looks like 2024 consensus estimates right now, anticipate you're going to spend about 4% more next year than you did this year to keep production flat with the current level. So I know it's too early to give guidance for '24, but just want to get your view on that outlook. Vicki Hollub : What we're seeing is we're seeing some things start to plateau in terms of cost. We're seeing labor being still a bit tight. But there's also around labor though, we're not seeing as many people wanting to change jobs. It's just a matter of getting the skills that we need in the field, and that's where the big challenge is to get truckers to drive trucks and people to do the welding and those kinds of fill jobs are so important to us. But I would think that what -- we're not -- while we're not seeing any reduction -- much reduction in service company costs. We don't expect that. But I don't think we've settled on expecting any kind of increase next year. Richard Jackson : And I can add maybe just a few. I agree with Vicki. I mean, we're, one, really pleased with the efficiency of our operations. That's always our focus. And so really, the rigs we've added over the last 1.5 years, we've highlighted some of the kind of individual goals, but we're seeing productivity just from reducing non-productive time, improved kind of efficiency of the operations continue. But as we think about going into next year, OCTG, seeing some relief, but that generally lags, sand kind of similar in fuel, obviously, is a component, which has been lower for us. So we're seeing those types of things come in a little bit lower. But we've got really, the opportunity to continue to work with the fleet we have. We're a pretty steady operational pace at this point, which is very different to where we've been in the last couple of years. And so for us, it's really an opportunity to kind of utilize the resources we have and really get that optimization down. So if we look next year, that's going to continue to be the challenge. We hope there's some pricing that can benefit both operator and service company as we look at longer term, but we're really anxious to keep working on the efficiency. Neil Backhouse : And Michael, this is Neil. I just wanted to add. We'll always encourage our coverage group not to rely too much on consensus for whatever time period. As you know, the further out it goes, the more sale data that can be in there. So just continue to have the conversations with us, and we'll guide at the appropriate time. Michael Scialla : Got you. I guess just summing all that up, though, I guess based on those numbers that would suggest you'd need to spend more to keep production flat. Is it fair to say that feels conservative based on what you know today? Vicki Hollub : I would say we don't know that because we're continuing to get more barrels. I mean just look at the graphs where our teams are getting more production from the wells for either the same or lower cost. We're doing both. We're increasing efficiencies of execution while also getting more recovery out of the wells. So I don't think I'd be prepared to say that we'd have to spend more capital just to stay flat. We'll look at that. And again, the efficiencies that are being gained, I think we have to take all that into account. And we'll -- we're starting to look at some of that now, but I'm a bit impressed with what we've been able to do with the dollar to spend because I think that we still have for our wedge production, the lowest capital intensity on a per barrel basis in the industry, I believe, at least the last time we checked it. Now we haven't done that number in a couple of months. So we probably need to check that again to know for sure. Michael Scialla : Appreciate the detail on that. The one to follow up on your agreement with ADNOC. Does that cover Stratos? And do you have any sense for what kind of capital the company is looking to spend with you at this point? Vicki Hollub : It doesn't cover Stratos, but it does cover other things, and it could cover things that we currently have today, not -- probably not the first deck at the King Ranch. But what we had done is we put together a work group worked with ADNOC to talk about what the possibilities are for direct air capture and sequestration here in the United States versus Abu Dhabi. And the big focus was to try to help each of us to achieve the goals that we've set out. And ADNOC just set another goal for themselves to get to net zero, I think, by 2025. So they're on a mission. They have a goal, and we also do and we -- given the fact that we collaborated on making and building the what is now the largest and what was it, even at the time, the largest ultra-sour gas processing plant in the world. There were several companies that walked away from that they didn't want to try to attempt that. So we have a track record of working with ADNOC to do difficult things or to do things that are different. The sulfur recovery units in Al Hosn in our serial numbers 1 through 4. So that's -- that was a bold step for us. And now we're taking this bold step to go into looking to help each other and also to help our shareholders because the way we're doing this is in a way that it's not going to be a cost for us over time. It's going to be -- it's going to deliver returns and ADNOC is focused on that as well. So we have a very similar objectives around all of how we're doing this. And so the work team now will continue and start looking at sites here in the U.S. and the UAE and pick the one that gives us the best chance to ensure that right out of the gate, we're starting with a good project. Operator: The next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I guess I'd like to follow up on some of the carbon capture. We saw a transaction occur, I guess, now about a month ago, on conventional sort of CO2 EOR. And I was wondering, as you look at your own operations there, anything you can look at or examining along those lines? Or have you had any inquiries from others about trying to expand the opportunity there? Vicki Hollub : I can't comment too much on what's happened. But I will say that there's probably not any carbon capture or CO2 EOR things that are happening in the U.S. or even worldwide that we don't follow very closely, one of which we had followed probably for a few decades or at least a couple of decades. But when we look at it, we -- and Richard can build on this. So we have now structured what we're doing so that we can focus on the things that we do best. And the things, as we've talked about in this call, the things that we do best are: one, understanding the subsurface. And since we have used CO2 for EOR for almost 50 years, what we're doing now is just a different way, a different kind of reservoir to put the CO2 into.So a different type of modeling, but all the same work goes into it and all the same the same techniques and approach go into looking at how we handle the CO2 and how we get it sequestered, whether it's in an EOR reservoir in the Permian or elsewhere or whether it's in a saline reservoir. So that part of it is our expertise. We don't really feel the need to own pipelines because pipeline returns are generally not the kind of returns that we can get with our dollars invested in either the upstream business or shale business or conventional. So what we want to do is make sure that our capital dollars are going to the things that we do best. We've partnered with midstream companies in the sequestration hubs that we've developed. And again -- but we do have as you mentioned and referred to significant infrastructure. We do have 2,500 miles of CO2 pipeline in the Permian. We're operating there 13 CO2 processing plants. And so we have the basis to do a lot of work and a lot of sequestration in the Permian, where I think the Permian as a whole, I think the capacity is estimated to be large enough to sequester all of the emissions from the United States for 28 years, and we have a big footprint in the Permian. There are multiple zones we can not only implement CO2 for EOR, but for a straight sequestration. So we're doing partnerships that give us the best return in collaborating because there's going to be a lot of capital required for these projects over time, and we don't want all of that capital coming from OXY. Obviously, we want other companies doing what they do best to. Richard, do you want to comment on some of the sequestration hubs? Richard Jackson : Sure. I mean -- yes, just build a minute. I think even especially in our Permian EOR or Permian position, we continue to work many carbon capture opportunities. We continue to think because of that legacy position we have, especially in the subsurface that that's going to present economic and real opportunity for us and emitters in terms of being able to capture and retire the CO2. In terms of the Gulf Coast, I know we talked about it before, but I want to reiterate, like Vicki said, be very focused on the sequestration of the subsurface piece of that. That's really as we learned where we could best add value, it's around that position, and we have our hubs that are going in the Gulf Coast. We've got several of our Class 6 wells that are permitted and moving well through the process may have up to 6 by the end of the year. We're drilling strat wells really in every hub continuing to be prepared as we think these capture projects are going to be put together and come online over the next few years. So we really think we're positioned to be the low-cost kind of sequestration certainly providing security around the CO2 because of our history. So great partnerships with midstream companies we've announced before, and they're an important piece, but we're really focused on that, both in the Permian and in the Gulf Coast around really developing that subsurface for sequestration. Operator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Vicki and the team, with the improvement that you're seeing in DJ, what should we expect from the activity and the production trajectory for the next several years? I mean in the past that I think with the limitation on the inventory or there maybe concern about regulatory, that production for you has been on the decline. Should we assume that the decline will continue, but at a slower pace or that you think you may be able to do better than that? That's the first question. Vicki Hollub : Okay. I'll turn that over to Richard. Richard's been actually looking at that more closely. Richard Jackson : Sure. Yes. Let me just kind of walk you through where we were this year. Obviously, we were significantly underinvested in the last couple of years coming out of the downturn, really focusing capital on the shortest cycle we really restored capital back to the Rockies this year back to more sustaining levels, but the teams continued to outperform. And so what really has happened this year is a shallower decline in the first half of the year. We had expected growth in the second half of the year, but the growth is actually a bit better. So if you look at kind of where we're at first half to second half, I think we're growing about 6,000 barrels a day. So the -- in terms of rigs, we're running capable -- been running 2 capable for 3. And we continue to work on these well improvements to see really how that asset and that production competes for capital in our portfolio going into next year. But I think really the -- sort of the capital that you're seeing deployed in the Rockies this year takes us from a decline into really a flat to moderate -- low-end growth. Paul Cheng : Rich, can we assume that that's the minimum that you will be able to do for the next several years that led to maybe modest growth? Richard Jackson : Look, the teams have continued -- we challenge everybody, but I think the Rockies team has really done a great job on this. Getting upfront in terms of land development, permits, really getting the midstream position in place to be able to do more. But again, it needs to fit our capital allocation. So they do high returns even at lower gas prices. These are very competitive returns. I would call them a bit longer cycle than the, say, the Delaware in Texas, but they also have a bit lower decline. And so for us, they fit really well. We'll have capability to do more, but it really needs to fit the sort of cash flow outcome that the company needs as we put capital together for next year. But we can do more as that fits.Operator: The next question comes from Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : So I wanted to go back to Stratos, the first DAC plant in Texas. You've made some progress in contracting some of the offtake there. I was wondering if you could just talk at a higher level on the demand that you're seeing for offtake from that DAC facility? And then I think signing offtake was one of the key factors driving some of the ranges in capital spending for lower carbon ventures this year. Could you just talk about where we're trending within that range as well? Richard Jackson : Yes, great. I'll start with the CDR sales. I think as we've continue to talk about, we really believe in the market and believe that really the formation and sales are following kind of our expectations. I mean clearly pleased with strategic, strong strategic customers like A&amp;A that recognize really the fit of our product, which is a into a larger aviation decarbonization. So while there -- we think about broadly sustainable aviation fuels, we feel like CDRs fit well into that market. So if you look at some of the equivalents on probably a better marked market in terms of sustainable aviation fuels, those may range $800 to $1,000 a ton we believe we're going to settle into that market well. Really, the key for us, though, as we continue to talk, is driving the innovation and cost down in DAC. And so we remain focused not only the construction parts going on in Permian with Stratos, but also in our King Ranch development, but very pleased with the progress carbon engineering makes with their innovation center. So I didn't want to talk about just the market because we do believe that cost down is important for us. to make this affordable long term. The other mark I'll give you, just in terms of thinking about kind of sales and how the CDRs fit on the price ranges I think in April European Parliament put together some things around requiring 2% SAF mix starting in 2025 and some of those penalties are $550 per ton of CO2. So when you look at how we can compete directly offset that at a lower cost. We think that's another mark that really helps us think about how we can be competitive. Devin McDermott : Great. And then just on the lower carbon spending in your plan this year, I think the offtake and the ability to finance off balance sheet was one of the swing factors. Can you just give us an update on that process as well? Richard Jackson : Yes. No, I think -- look, we remain optimistic that we're going to have good partners as we think about financing this long term. We've been strong in our ability to be able to carry the near term, but we understand longer term that we need financial partners that come into this with us, and we continue to make progress. Just to talk about the capital, we've stayed with the range $200 million to $600 million for the year. And really, that reflects that room to bring in that capital partnership by the end of the year Vicki Hollub : Yes. And I would say, Devin, I appreciate your interest and we will have a bit more of an update in November. I want to give anybody to thinking it's some sort of major announcement, it's not. It's just an update just like what Richard gave now because things are continuing to change with respect to demand for CDRs and that sort of thing. So we'll give you a little more of that in November. Richard Jackson : Yes. I think construction progress, I should say, we're about 23%, I think, to date. So we'll have more construction progress. We think we can point more to the market. And just kind of follow-up on that deep dive we had last year kind of giving some updates on how these pieces come together. Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : Yes. Just had one question, just following up on that last point. The ADNOC MOU is quite encouraging. But whether it's ADNOC or another partner? In terms of just thinking about making that equity investment in DAC, do the partners that you're talking with, do they want to see the learnings from Stratos manifest into lower capital and operating costs DAC 2 or DAC 3 to pull the trigger on an investment? Or do you sense that just showcasing progress in constructing Stratos and getting it up and running would be sufficient to attract equity funding into the program?Vicki Hollub : I would say with ADNOC, they know our track record of building major projects and they know Ken Dillon well, who's actually manages our major projects. So they've seen us and how we not only we're innovative in how we built Al Hosn, but we were also innovative in this just recent expansion to expand the plant by almost 50% with probably spend way under 10% is -- was phenomenal. And so I think that ADNOC will be prepared to move forward with us sooner than waiting on what happens with Stratos. I think they all understand that technologies go through a cost down. There's never been a technology that's worked and been adopted in large way without having gone through the same kind of thing that we'll go through with our director capture Richard Jackson : Yes. And the only thing I would add, I mean, there definitely is different capital, I think as we're able to move down that cost down over the next decade. We really like to partner with strategics like ADNOC or others that can be a part of not only the near term, but the long term. But obviously, we want to get the right value and set up the right economics for both parties as we bring them in. And so I think, of course, long term, as we bring costs down, the market forms, we expect that to open really capital, and that's a big part of our ability to scale development. And so to answer your question, yes, I do think that changes -- presents more opportunities over time. Vicki Hollub : Yes. One final comment on it is, partnering with ADNOC, we know their capabilities and expertise, too. So we know what they bring to the table. And so that's the other exciting aspect of this is having their knowledge and their experience, their expertise combined with ours, to do whichever we do or a combination of both the CCUS and the director capture. Operator: The next question comes from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen. David Deckelbaum : I'm going to try to ask one perfect question. I was curious, you mentioned before, obviously, with the curve where it is now, you need to see it a bit higher to start prosecuting more preferred redemptions. Does the cash flow priority change given the fact that it's harder to achieve that milestone in the coming quarters? Or should we expect sort of a similar pace or distribution or free cash via buybacks sort of irrespective of where the curve is in the back half of this year? And does it change how you think about capital allocation, perhaps into next year relative to sustaining capital versus growth capital? Vicki Hollub : I would say that we're not going to execute a large growth program in our upstream oil and gas business. So -- but I will say that our intent is to keep a moderate capital spend, what we consider to be something similar to the activity level that we have on a whole year basis, not the second half, but take the second half of this year and project it into next year is what our oil and gas activity level would be. But what we want to do is we just want a program that delivers the best returns at present value. So that doesn't mean that we're going to take our capital framework right now and dramatically change it. Share repurchases is a part of that. And that's -- it's an important part of that. And what we do will depend on the macro. But from the -- what -- I would say what we see with the macro now, I wouldn't discount our ability to do both to repurchase common shares whilst also being able to redeem some of the preferred next year because I do see a better price environment, I believe, than what some realize it's going to be. So I think there are a lot of reasons pointing to a pretty good environment. So I wouldn't discount it yet. I do believe that we'll have the opportunity to do both, but share repurchases will always be a part of our framework. Rob Peterson : The other thing I'll add, David, too, is in 2023, because our share repurchase program is thus far, far more ratable in our concentration in purchases last year. We're creating a foundation for 2024. We don't have as many slugs to overcome with us that necessitate spikes in oil prices or whatever to get there. So we are laying the groundwork for next year even as we continue to buy share repurchases this year, whether or not we're retiring preferred along with it or not. Operator: In the interest of time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vicki Hollub for any closing remarks. Vicki Hollub : I would just like to say thank you all for joining us, and have a great day. Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, you may now disconnect.]"

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 32% over five years, which is below the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 4.2% in that time.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Coca-Cola achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 35% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 6% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Coca-Cola the TSR over the last 5 years was 54%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 8.2% in the last year, Coca-Cola shareholders lost 1.3% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola   you should know about.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

(NYSE:WM) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/83-ownership-shares-waste-management-110053422.html,1691319653,STORY,['WM'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Waste Management implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 24 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessIf you want to know who really controls Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Waste Management. View our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Waste Management. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Waste Management's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Waste Management is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.3%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.7% and 7.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Waste Management, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$129m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in Waste Management. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Waste Management better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Waste Management .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NYSE:IR) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript August 3, 2023 Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Kayla Baker, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ingersoll Rand Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to, Vice President of Investor Relations, Matthew Fort. You may begin. Matthew Fort: Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2023 second quarter earnings call. I am Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call.Ingersoll-Rand PLC (NYSE:IR)Please review the forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more details. In addition, today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2023 guidance. For today's Q&amp;A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Vicente Reynal: Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. Our employees continue to deliver on our commitments, despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, and consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners. I would also like to welcome, our new employees from our recent acquisitions. Together, we have a great opportunity to build upon our strong complementary brands, products and capabilities, providing customers and the industry with a broader spectrum of solutions. Beginning on slide 3, fueled by our competitive differentiator, IRX in the second quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We recently published our 2022 sustainability report, where we yet again delivered industry-leading results, while remaining on track to meet our 2030 sustainability goals. Finally, based on our continued robust performance in Q2, we're once again raising our 2023 full year guidance. As we move to slide 4, our economic growth engine is the key, to how we deliver compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in Q4 of 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic and quality of earning growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined in this page. On the next slides, I will provide you with deeper insights into our organic initiatives, which are centered, around product innovation and innovative value also known as i2V. In addition, we will provide an update on our progress towards our inorganic goals. Turning to slide 5, we start with our organic growth initiatives. Here, we have some examples of how in China, we have leveraged products localization as well as i2V to drive organic growth. On the left-hand side of the page, we show how localization has created new product offerings and enabled channel expansion all with a focus on high-growth sustainable end markets. Since the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand merger, our blower and vacuum product lines have grown organically at a 17% CAGR. On the right-hand side of the page, we have an example of organic growth through the combination of recently acquired M&amp;A and i2V. As you can see in the pictures at the bottom right-hand side of the page, the Asia Pacific team conducted a turndown event with legacy products, recently acquired M&amp;A and competitive technologies. The outcome of that turndown event is the development of a new oil-free screw vacuum pump. This new product will expand our addressable market by over $350 million, and will go from development to launch in approximately six months. Next, on Slide 6, M&amp;A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We are thrilled to highlight our recently signed M&amp;A deal Roots. This iconic Roots brand is a leading provider of low-pressure compression and vacuum technology. This brand is synonymous with blowers in the same way that clinics and Bandaid are recognized in consumer markets. We're very excited to acquire this iconic brand, which has been in business for almost 200 years. The acquisition also expands our capabilities in both low-pressure technology and centrifugal technology. And this technology is a critical component in the process of green steel manufacturing. Our M&amp;A funnel remains strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five time larger than it was at the time of the R&amp;D. We currently have seven transactions at the LOI stage. And more importantly, we have several other transactions in process, which are close to the LOI stage. Based on acquisitions to date, the seven transactions under LOI at our current M&amp;A funnel, we are reaffirming our commitment to an additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. On Slide 7, we recently released our 2022 sustainability report, showcasing the commitment and results of our strategic imperative leads sustainably. We have made significant progress in establishing ourselves as a top quartile ESG company by leveraging our competitive differentiator, IRX to deliver results in a very short period of time. In fact, we have received several industry-leading sustainability acknowledgments of our efforts, including being named to both the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Ingersoll Rand was ranked as the number one performer in the IEQ machinery and electrical equipment industry in North America and number four globally in 2022. As a very close 2023, Ingersoll-Rand received an ESG risk rating of low at 12.8% from Morningstar Sustainalytics. We also received an ESG rating improvement to AA in 2023 from MSCI and ranked as a leader among 47 companies in the industrial machinery category. More important, we're also leading the way in the social aspect of ESG with our employee ownership model. We believe employee ownership creates economic opportunity for our employees and their families while driving increased employee engagement as our long-term shareholder. To that end, we have awarded approximately $275 million since 2017 in equity to our employees, employees that are not already on the management equity program. This has increased to over $660 million in value as of June 30, 2023. We will continue to offer our ownership works program that grant equity to all new employees after the 1-year anniversary. Our employees are a critical element of our business and making life better for them begins with opportunity. Through their engagement and commitment, we are on track to meet our 2030 sustainability objectives. With this, I'll turn now the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance. Vik Kini: Thanks, Vicente. On slide 8, fueled by IRX, we again delivered solid results in Q2 through a balance of commercial and operational execution. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 5% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Book-to-bill was 1.03, and we remain encouraged with the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 12% year-over-year and up approximately 5% sequentially. The backlog is approximately 45% higher than it was at the end of 2021, which gives us good visibility and momentum as we move into the back half of 2023 and start to look into 2024. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $425 million, a 27% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.2%, a 190 basis point year-over-year improvement. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up 25% versus the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to the need to support backlog as well as continued global supply chain challenges. Even with these headwinds, free cash flow was up 24% versus prior year. Total liquidity of $3.2 billion at quarter end was up approximately $1 billion sequentially. This increase was driven in large part due to the recently amended, extended and upsized revolving facility, which took place in early Q2 of this year. Our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 1.0 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than both the prior year and prior quarter. Finally, I'd like to highlight an example of the power of our ownership mindset and the effectiveness of our competitive differentiator, IRX. Due to the team's resiliency in overcoming the cybersecurity incident, the Q2 revenue and adjusted EBITDA risk associated with the incident was mitigated within the quarter. This is no small task, and I would like to thank all of our employees that were involved in helping to overcome this impediment, enabling us to deliver tremendous results in Q2. Turning to slide 9. For the total company, Q2 orders grew 10% and revenue increased 18%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 27% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 200 basis points, while the PST segment margin improved 240 basis points. Notably, both segments remain price cost dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at approximately $43 million for the quarter, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IIoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 25% to $0.68 per share. This $0.14 year-over-year increase includes a $0.04 headwind from interest expense. And finally, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24%. Moving on to the next slide. I want to highlight that the company was assigned an investment-grade first-time issuer default rating from Fitch. We have now received investment-grade ratings from two of the three major rating agencies, and we remain committed to becoming an investment-grade rated across all of our rating agencies. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, including CapEx, which totaled $25 million. Total company liquidity was $3.2 billion based on approximately $1.2 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $49 million deployed to M&amp;A and we returned $64 million to shareholders through $56 million in share repurchases and $8 million in dividends. M&amp;A remains our top priority for our capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&amp;A to be our primary usage of cash for the foreseeable future. We continue to have an active and healthy funnel of inorganic growth opportunities. This funnel consists primarily of bolt-on M&amp;A relatively similar in size, scope and nature to the assets we have acquired over the past two to three years. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results. Vicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On Slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 14% with volume growth slightly outpacing pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 200 basis points from the prior year with an incremental margin of 38%. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 8% and a book-to-bill of 1.05. Note that on a two-year stack, ITS organic orders have grown 19%. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which year-over-year was approximately a 1.5 percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenues. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low double digits. We continue to see oil free product orders outpace oil lubricated products. Orders were up low double digits in the Americas, with North America also up low double digits, demonstrating that we continue to see momentum from secular trends around ESG, on-shoring and near-shoring as well as continued investments on energy savings. EMEIA demand continued to be above market with orders up high single digits. The Asia Pacific team continues to deliver a great performance with order growth in the mid-teens, driven by continued solid execution from our team in China where they saw orders up in the low 20s. Today, we showed on Slide 5, an example of how the team in China continues to outperform the market conditions with our own self-help initiatives. Vacuum and blower orders were up mid-teens and every region saw positive orders with good strength from Europe. Orders in the power tools and lifting business was up low single digits. Moving now to the innovation and action portion of the slide, we're illustrating an oil free hydrogen compressor recently launched in EMEIA. This product is a perfect example of how we continue to focus our portfolio on high-growth, sustainable end markets with region-for-region manufacturing. The EMEIA team collaborated with a clean energy tech startup in the Netherlands to develop and build a system for our innovative hydrogen process, and the first unit was shipped in July. Turn to Slide 12. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment grew 5% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $90 million, which was up 16% year-over-year with incremental margins of 66%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.2%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven primarily by price cost improvements, synergy delivery on acquired businesses like Seepex, and the impact of China lockdowns in the second quarter of 2022, which did not repeat. Organic orders were down 10% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 0.95 times. It is important to note that the book-to-bill was one-time for the first half of the year. The primary driver of the organic order decline related to larger frame orders not repeating in the life science businesses, as well as the expected decline of longer cycle orders in the Agritech platform. Our book and ship business was solid, and we believe that the core business within PST remains very healthy. For PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our new peristaltic pump technology that is used for water treatment, industrial and life sciences market. This product innovative design provides a robust alternative for chemical dosing and transfer applications. The products are IoT-ready and complement our already strong portfolio of products for water treatment and chemical applications offering customers the opportunity to choose the best technology for each application. Leveraging this technology across both Albin Pump and LMI brands, we continue to execute our multi-brand, multi-channel strategy while expanding our addressable market by over $250 million. Moving to slide 13. Given the solid performance in the first half and continued momentum from backlog, we're again raising our 2023 guidance. As you may recall, during Q1 earnings, we guided an anticipated impact of approximately $20 million of adjusted EBITDA moving out of Q2 and into the back half of the year due to the cybersecurity incident that we experienced in late April. As Vik mentioned earlier, this risk was mitigated within the quarter and no significant revenue or adjusted EBITDA is now expected to have been pushed into the back half. We have included some additional commentary on the bottom right-hand side of the page, outlining the increase in full year guidance incorporating the impact from the Q2 outperformance and the improvement in organic growth expectations in the second half of the year. For the full year, total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 12% and 14%, which is a 200 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 8% to 10%, where price and volume is split approximately 60-40. FX is now expected to be a slight headwind, however, approximately flat on a full year basis. Our revenue from M&amp;A has increased $30 million to approximately $300 million. This increase reflects the impact from all completed and closed M&amp;A transactions as of August 1, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $165 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter throughout the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.69 billion and $1.74 billion, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and up 7% versus our initial guidance. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.70 and $2.80, which is up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate, total interest expense or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, all remain in line with both initial and prior guidance. Turning now to slide 14. As we wrap today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q2 performance and ongoing backlog momentum. We remain nimble. We continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions, and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you for an excellent first half of the year. These results show the impact that each of you have as owners of the company. However, we're still a long way to go, and we need to remain focused on our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your continued hard work, resiliency and focus action. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to invest with the highest return. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open the call for Q&amp;A. See also 20 Highest Rated Pilsner Beers in 2023 and 15 Worst Performing NASDAQ Stocks In 2023.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Michael Halloran: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. So can we just talk about how the underlying trends you saw through the quarter, maybe any sequential commentary and a focus on where you saw any changes positively or negatively, or is the demand environment essentially cadencing how you would have expected -- on an underlying level? Vicente Reynal: Yeah, I'll say, Mike, we saw the sequential cadence in the quarter, very comparable to what we always see, which is typically lower on month one and kind of starts ramping up through the quarter, and we saw that happening pretty well. So nothing that, we will call anything different out of color. So -- which obviously continues to show that there is good cadence and momentum and that more important for us to as well is the leading indicators. And particularly as we always talk about the MQLs, those marketing qualified leads that we generate with our demand generation engine. And that continues to see good sustainable pace momentum across the product lines, which is encouraging to see. Michael Halloran: And on the PST side, can you just put those orders in context a little bit. I certainly understand the Agritech side and some of the larger projects, orders not repeating. But it sounds like things are healthy when you exclude those 2 pieces. And maybe a little bit of help on how you expect the order trends to track from here and recovery curves in some of those markets? Vicente Reynal: Yeah. Sure, Mike. I mean I think you said it very well. I mean, I think what we continue to see that we get excited is that the book and turn business remains pretty strong in the business, which you could call it the short cycle side of the business. And then what we saw here in the quarter, it was just that lumpiness with Agritech with some of our businesses that last year, we're doing on some large projects and also some of the oxygen concentration business that kind of similar to what we spoke in the first quarter of kind of large frame orders that happened last year, not this year. So I guess -- so with that, I think we continue to stay very encouraged. We see that the trend in the PST segment continues to be to deliver that mid-single-digit plus. I mean, there's definitely no over the cycle and over time. So there's no change in that long-term perspective of what we can achieve here in the PST team with the PST segment, and we anticipate continued momentum here. So, yes. Michael Halloran: Thanks, Vicente. Vicente Reynal: Yeah. Thank you, Mike. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell: Thanks very much. Good morning. Maybe first question just around that split of sort of how you see the second half playing out between Q3 and 4. I think the guide embeds are sort of low 70s EPS figure each quarter, but just wondered about how much of that ends up being weighted into Q4 and if there's any big difference between the two segments from that standpoint? Vicente Reynal: Yes. Julian, for total Ingersoll Rand on revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin Q3 looks a lot like Q2. And I'll say for Q3 on a year-over-year basis, remember that comps get increasingly more difficult. And as we think about the segments, ITS, for example, ITS is expected to grow revenue still at low double digit, including the impact of M&amp;A, and as a reminder, I mean, think about that tough comp where Q3 of last year, we grew 19% organically. So that's kind of what we talk about those tough comps. But we still see a good line of sight to about 100 basis points of margin expansion in ITS. And PST is expected to grow mid-single digits. And as a reminder, that's on top of 20% growth in Q3 of 2022 and margins to be expected back again into that 30% level of EBITDA. Julian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just secondly, when you're thinking about the sort of firm-wide orders and backlog trajectory from here across both businesses. Are we thinking sort of orders flattish organically year-on-year in the back half and then the sort of backlog maybe starts to drift down a bit sequentially, just as those lead times shorten. And so sort of customers can adjust their orders a little bit? Vicente Reynal: Yes. Julian, yes, I mean, clearly, we don't specifically guide on orders. But again, as a reminder, our Q3 prior year is probably 1 of the toughest comps for orders. As I recall, Q3 last year was roughly 14% organic order growth momentum, so very solid. In terms of the backlog, I'll say, we do anticipate backlog to drift down a little bit in the back half as we mentioned in the past, I mean, the normal cadence for orders is typically a book-to-bill greater than one in the first half due to larger longer projects and booking in the first half has been -- and booking in the second half being kind of less than one due to those larger orders kind of getting shipped most predominantly in the fourth quarter. Having said that, as a reminder, I think the past nine quarters out of 10 quarters, we had a book-to-bill of greater than one, so -- which obviously speaks again to the comps that we're seeing here.Julian Mitchell: That makes sense. Thanks very much. Vicente Reynal: Thank you. Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Vicente Reynal: Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague: Hi, good morning. Vicente, can you elaborate a little bit more on your talking about demand in ITS and compressors in particular, you noted reshoring and ESG? I guess on the ESG side, you're pointing to kind of energy efficiency sort of investments and retrofit. But a, is that the case? And b, can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in those two buckets? Vicente Reynal: Yes, Jeff. So absolutely. I mean, again, we're very pleased with the momentum that we saw on the compressor product line, and particularly, you saw that oil-free compressor outpacing the growth and that was kind of high 20s momentum that we saw on the oil-free. So very, very exciting to see that one of the core strategies that we launched continues to actually see some fruit and growth. In terms of ESG, I mean we continue to see that the energy savings, again, based on the return on the investment that we have conversations with customers still is resonating quite well and -- so that momentum continues. Our few earnings ago, we spoke about the air audits that we're doing. We continue to do that at a faster clip than ever before, and that's really driving a lot of good leading data points for us as we see kind of moving forward. And from a reshoring, yes, it's kind of whether you think about reinsuring companies expanding capacity or reallocating their supply chains more locally. I talked about also near-shoring because clearly, in Mexico, we're seeing a lot of expansion too as well. And we have a very strong team as well in Mexico there that is really capturing some good momentum to as well. But this reshoring is happening here in the U.S. We see it, that's why we reopened Buffalo at that time, but we also see it in India, and we see it in China as well. So we see good momentum of companies really investing in the core technologies and in particularly here, the compressor systems. Jeff Sprague: And maybe you could give us a little color on service too, Vicente. I would imagine if customers are going through the air audit process that creates quite an opportunity for service and stickier service attachment on the back end. Where are you at now on service as a percent of revenues? And how is that growing? Vicente Reynal : Yes, absolutely. Jeff, particularly the statistic that we said before is that roughly these are audience, we see kind of a 70-30, 70% leading to new equipment, but 30% leading to actually incremental service revenue. And we've seen good momentum in terms of -- we spoke a lot about Care and the Packaged Care solutions, the team in North America continues to really accelerate that. And we're seeing now better momentum as well in our team in Europe and also in team in Asia. So yes, this continues to be very front and center in our strategy and particularly as we continue to connect more compressors with our remote monitoring devices and be able to capture more recurring revenue here. So yes, we continue to be actually a one that we see good momentum to come. Jeff Sprague: Great. Thank you. Vicente Reynal : Thank you. Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Rob Wertheimer : Hey, good morning. Vicente Reynal : Good morning. Rob Wertheimer : Vicente, I think you touched on China, APAC orders and compressors up mid-teens. I think that's comping mid-teens. And so -- I know you called out kind of the good job the team has done there. Is there any particular end market strength in China that's adding to that? I think we've seen China be a drag elsewhere in industrials. And then just in general, I don't know if you can expand on your market position there and the broader efforts you're doing? Thank you. Vicente Reynal: Yes, Rob, I think there's definitely some in markets that strategically we're going after more pronouncedly than others because we're seeing the growth in those you could think about electric vehicles, battery production, lithium, mining and things like that. But a lot of that, as you very well said too, as well, it kind of continues to change end markets. And I think the ability for us to pivot from 1 end market that has seen some growth to the other end market that are starting to see the spurt of growth, that is what I think is very core to what the team very nimbly is doing. In addition to that, I think what's exciting is the combination of the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand company, where the team in China is leveraging a lot of the kind of, call it, legacy Gardner Denver products of blowers and the vacuums to really accelerate growth.And that's, as you saw on Slide 5, how we see this organic revenue CAGR of 17% on this kind of core product line and technology. So I'll say, yes, the team is firing on all cylinders this morning as I was driving, I was actually chatting with our leader in China. He's actually -- was actually our -- he was with the team at our innovation center in China and doing a review of their new product technologies and he was living super inspire and excited. So again, it's just a good team, solid performance and very happy with how the team continues to navigate this tough environment in China. Rob Wertheimer : Excellent. Thank you. Vicente Reynal: Thank you. Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning everyone. Vicente Reynal: Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz: Vicente, could you give us a little more color into the dynamics of your compressor order strength in the sense that, I think, historically, you've had 20% cycle versus 80% short cycle. The long cycle business is currently much stronger than short cycle in one end markets. If you could give us some detail or driving the most order growth right now? Vicente Reynal: Yeah. I would say Andy, maybe not a dramatic change. I mean, maybe instead of being 80-20, could it be 70-30, potentially? Yes. But not in such a dramatic way. So we see good momentum on the long and the short, I think what we're very happy with is the performance of the oil-free. Oil-free, which tends to be higher level of technology, more difficult for others to penetrate. So we still see this as a main market and a product line that we see continued momentum for growth as we continue to take more share in a good way. Andy Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then Vik, it looks like it's just a tweak, but I think you actually lowered your incremental margin forecast for the year to 35% versus 35% to 40% previously despite you beating margin in Q2, and I would imagine price versus cost of anything is getting better in the second half versus the first half. So could you give us more color into what you're seeing there? Vik Kini: Sure. Yeah, Andy. I think in terms of the last part of your question on the price cost, like we said before, we were very early in our pricing actions. I think right now, the expectation is the back half looks fairly comparable to how we were guiding before. I wouldn't call that a meaningful change. In terms of the margin tweak as you put it, it's just that, just a minor tweak. A couple of things to note, we did call out that there's some slight increase on corporate cost. We did have -- you saw some of the capital that was deployed to M&amp;A. So we did actually have a technology acquisition that we completed in Q2 that right now, I'd say minimal revenue base to the cost base but one that we're very excited about for the future. So again, when you put those two in perspective, that's probably the meaningful portion there. And as we've always said, we're going to continue to invest in the business. I mean, as Vicente said, whether it be in Asia or anywhere else around the world. We're going to continue to invest in growth resources to drive out-performance from an organic growth perspective as we look forward. So I think that's the way we look at it in totality. But again, nothing in terms of a meaningful change in our opinion, from where we've been operating or prior guidance. Andy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it guys. Vik Kini: Thank you. Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe: Good morning. Vik Kini: Good morning, Nigel.Nigel Coe: Thanks. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to maybe just take a different crack at the second half margin question, I think you talked about 3Q looking like 2Q, which makes sense. This feels like the guide doesn't embed much of a kick-up in 4Q and normally 4Q margins are substantially higher on volumes. So just wondering what are you expecting for 4Q. Maybe my math is wrong, that's -- please correct me. But it does feel like we don't have much of a seasonal uplift in 4Q? Vik Kini: Sure. Yeah. So Nigel, I think the way you've described Q3 is correct. If you think about ITS as Vicente earlier said, I think ITS will look fairly comparable to Q2. Now that being said, that still would embed nice margin expansion on a year-over-year basis. And we would expect on the PFT side for margins to get back to that 30% level, specifically in Q3. Now on the Q4 side of the equation, whether you're looking from a total company perspective or the individual components, I think it's actually going to be fairly comparable to what you've seen historically. Seasonally, it is the strongest quarter in the year. That's no different. So you will see a slight seasonal uptick from Q3 to Q4. But there is incremental margin expansion included in the Q4 guide, I would say it's not dramatically different than our prior guide in that respect. And the one thing to probably note here as we look and we got some of the questions about it earlier in terms of the cadence, kind of, like what we said before, we're still, I think, continue to remain prudent on the back half expectations, particularly Q4 on the volume side. And I think we would still acknowledge that's probably the single source of potential upside to the guide as we sit here, thinking specifically about organic volume in Q4. Nigel Coe: Okay, okay. That's fair. And then vacuum -- taking into wiz here, but the vacuum trends remain really strong, compressor. But I think Copco called out a bit of weakness in industrial vacuum, not just semi, but also a little bit of weakness in industrial. And you're obviously not seeing that. So are you seeing any signs of weakness developing in any of your end markets? And is there a reason why vacuum and compressor would be couple? Just curious there. Vicente Reynal: Yes. Nigel, I would say that the industrial vacuum is kind of what we call rough vacuum when you look at the total market segmentation of that. And I will say that we have a more bigger spectrum of technologies, whether it's crew vacuum, rotary vein, liquid ring. So, we will say that we have not only great technologies, but also good brands. In terms of what we're seeing in the market, I'd say stability from what we're seeing. You could argue that sometimes the industrial vacuum plays slightly different where the industrial compressors will pay. So industrial vacuum many times will play in chemical processes or petrochem and things like that, things of that nature. But in our view, we're very happy and very pleased with what the team again continues to do from my self-help initiative here on driving new technologies. I mean we spoke about some of the technologies, again, not only on that slide five on what China team is doing. But now there's also new technologies that the team in Europe are launching to as well to start capturing even more share. So, I'll say that very, very pleased with the performance of the team is driving. Nigel Coe: That’s great color. Thanks a lot. Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie: Hey, good morning guys. Vicente Reynal: Good morning Joe. Vik Kini: Hi Joe. Joe Ritchie: Maybe just following along Nigel's questions around just potential weakness. I know that you're seeing really good order trends across your businesses, but there's a real focus right now on companies that are seeing destocking across their channels. And so maybe just on your shorter cycle businesses, just maybe talk to us about whether you see any kind of risk to any piece of your business today on -- from a channel perspective? Vicente Reynal: Yes, Joe, I'll say maybe -- I'll start with the two big buckets, obviously, the ITS and PST. On the ITS side, a lot of the product -- I say the majority of the product that we have in the ITS is really customized to specific applications. So, it's very difficult to kind of at least on our technology to really have stock of those compressors in the shelves. It's basically high working capital for the distribution channel network that we have. So, we don't see much of that. At the same time, we have a very loyal channel and we have access and visibility to what levels of inventory they have. On the PST side, PST will be the 1 that maybe plays a little bit more on what we call the national distribution, national industrial distribution, at least particularly in the US here.And on those, we track very on a monthly cadence, sell in and sell out. So, we have a visibility on how much we're selling to the channel and how much of that channel is selling out. So at least we get visibility with the level of inventory that is somewhat available in the shelves and whether it is getting destocking or overstocking, we're always proactively trying to prevent the overstocking. It's a situation that we just don't like to be entangled with. So I think -- I'd say we've been fairly proactive from that perspective to making sure that we're watching those trends carefully, nothing of material of note that we're seeing in terms of major destocking. But again, it has to do because there was not a lot of overstocking as well. So -- I don't know that helps, but that's maybe a little bit of color there. Joe Ritchie: No, that's great. I figured as much, but I had to ask the question. So that's helpful color, Vicente. And, I guess, the follow-on question really kind of want to maybe dig into this opportunity, this oil-free hydrogen compressor opportunity. Maybe talk a little bit more about what the opportunity is there and then specifically what the applications are today? Vicente Reynal: Yes, Joe, I mean, I'll say this is a very, very exciting opportunity and one that this, we have now an engineering center inside in our facility in India. We're now considered to be one of the only India companies in India that has the capability of actually testing hydrogen compression systems. Hydrogen is going to be, we think, a good growth vector in the market in India. So we're happy to be the first, and we're happy to be the ones with the largest lab and technology center in India at this point in time, which is the reason why on the prior earnings call, we spoke about the expansion that we're doing. In terms of market sizing, I mean, I think I'd say it's still early stages from the perspective. We don't want to put numbers at -- I mean, obviously, if you kind of trust what market dynamics are saying, these are kind of huge markets, but we're not going to size it here on this call. I think on the Investor Day, we'll definitely give you a little bit more color on this one. But again, this is one super exciting opportunity that technology that the team in India was able to develop and actually work pretty closely with a company in Europe to develop something really unique. And in this case, we were kind of the only company that could achieve the performance requirement that it was required by this technology company. So again, it speaks volumes to the investments that we continue to make in R&amp;D and continued investments that we make in technologies that we think will play well for us in the future. Joe Ritchie: Awesome. Thanks, guys. Vicente Reynal: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open. Chris Snyder: Thank you. So Q2 really showed strength across all three geographies. And I understand that comps are obviously getting a good deal tougher into the back half of the year and price contribution is easing. But when you look at these three geographies, is there any one or any place where you see demand softening on the leading edge? Vicente Reynal: I mean, I think, Chris, note that our MQLs are demonstrating or showing. We're -- even as we look here into the month of early days in July, I'll say that there continues to be that sustained momentum that we were seeing in the second quarter from an MQL perspective. So noting that we will highlight of specifically end market or maybe, as you said, regional view that has seen a dramatic decline. Again, I think, it's tough comps as we go into the third quarter. I think if I remember the ITS, America teams, I mean, had really hefty double-digit like close to 30% of growth in orders Q3 of last year. So I mean those are the difficult comps that we talk about. But -- having said that, I mean, I think when you think about it in perspective, we have been posting double-digit revenue organic growth for like 9 out of the 10 quarters. So that's kind of what we talk about tough comps. But again, the team continues to perform, execute and control what they can control. Chris Snyder: Yeah. No, I appreciate that. Obviously, with the tough comps, you're trying to sometimes separate like demand from …. Vicente Reynal: Yeah. Chris Snyder: …growth. So I appreciate all that color. And then, I guess kind of following up on that. In prior quarters, you guys talked about basically flat backlog year-on-year to exit the year, building the first half burn in the back half. I know that's still generally the trajectory. But is -- do you still expect not to add any backlog throughout the year, even if we burn a little off in the back half, just does feel like demand may be running a little bit better than expected six months ago? Thank you. Vik Kini: Yeah. Chris, I think right now, our expectation is fairly consistent with what we've kind of messaged before. And you're absolutely right. When we came into the year, we did expect backlog to be largely flat as we look towards the end of the year. But we did explicitly say that, book-to-bill above one in the first half build backlog and then you'd see that kind of drift down, I think, as Vicente mentioned earlier in the second half of the year. And that's very consistent with, I'd say, our typical cadence, our typical seasonality, and based on what we're seeing now, given the level of backlog, but then also kind of the expectations for what we're seeing in the second half of the year. I don't think anything changed in that respect.To the point that was said before, I do think there continues to be an opportunity on the organic volume side, particularly probably more in the Q4 side of the equation, maybe as the upside to guide. But in terms of backlog being flat year in -- at the end of the year compared to where we started, I think that's still a fairly good expectation at this point in time. Chris Snyder: Thank you. Appreciate that. Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Vicente Reynal: Good morning. Vik Kini: Hi Joe. Joe O'Dea: Hi. So first, just another one on back half, but the price and volume dynamic within organic, it seems like the way the back half is set up between the quarters, we're looking at pretty similar organic growth, 3Q and 4Q. Just curious, in terms of kind of pricing comps and if what we're thinking about at this point is that it's really volume growth in the back half? Vik Kini: Yeah. Joe, the way I would probably think about it in terms of the back half. I do think if you look on a -- like we said, Q3 will look fairly similar to Q2, particularly on the ITS side, if you're thinking about revenue and bottom-line. I think the way to think about it if you want to kind of think about the two quarters individual. I think the organic growth side will probably be a little bit healthier in Q3 than Q4. Remember, Q4 of last year, we had an exceedingly strong end of the year, particularly in ITS. I think ITS Q4 organic sales growth was in excess of 20%. So again, aside from the kind of timing between the quarters, to your point, we do expect to see pricing continue to, I'd say, normalized in the back half. A lot of that is just, frankly, due to the timing of when we took price increases in the prior year. So we are now lapping that. And we would expect to see price continue to kind of ramp down on a sequential basis, but very consistent with what we said in terms of our original guide. I don't think anything has really changed on that end. And then again, on the volume side, again, volume, we continue to slightly up-tick our volume expectations for the back half, each of our successive guides. This guidance note is no different. And with the backlog, hopefully there's some opportunity to outperform there, as we think about Q4. Joe O'Dea: Got it. And then, Vicente, I think your response to kind of Rob's question was interesting on the ability to pivot to growth. And I'm curious, just in terms of the internal approaches to identifying that growth and how you try to sort of position in advance of it. So it's not so much of chasing the puck, but just being well-positioned for anticipating that. And kind of how far out that goes? I mean, what we can think about what you're doing today in terms of what you anticipate for growth? Vicente Reynal: Yeah. Joe you are right. Joe O'Dea: How far out it is? Vicente Reynal: Yeah. No, I love that question. Because we have a team -- I mean, a team for us, the team is like a team of one. But we have two people actually here sitting in our corporate offices that we're currently analyzing like 100-plus micro trends. And these are kind of trends that we're seeing early indicators of potentially becoming good vectors of growth. So that's one avenue how so early. We're looking at these new potential trends. I mean, give you one example could be lithium battery recycling. Clearly, with a lot of the production on electric vehicle and lithium battery production, there's going to come a time that batteries will need to recycle. So we're already looking at the technologies that we can incorporate in those and finding the early-stage development processes where we can actually incorporate a lot of our technologies and products. So -- and to think about it, I mean, we have about 100 of those kind of micro trends that at any point in time, we're analyzing and then we're leveraging our demand generation team to get close and closer to those customers to better understand how can we help and participate on those early trends. That's just one example of kind of how early we can do it. And then obviously, as you go to a country like China, I mean, the team, every year, we reassess the end markets that we expect to see a higher growth and then with pivot resources and technologies. And again, demand generation to be able to start attacking those early indications that we're seeing. Joe O'Dea: Very helpful. Thank you. Vicente Reynal: Yeah. Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Vicente Reynal: Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase: Most of mine have been answered today, but I guess one thing that I want to dig into is just I think there's concern among investors about potential slowing in Europe. So I mean it sounds like everything from your commentary is going pretty well there, but if we could just dig into that a little bit on what you're seeing? Thanks. Vicente Reynal: Yeah, Nicole, I'd say continues to see good momentum. But again, I think I always like to put it in perspective in terms of the self-help that we're driving ourselves. It doesn't mean that the total market is actually seeing the same momentum as we're seeing. I mean we're definitely outgrowing the market by a lot of the focus that we're doing on these kind of vectors of growth that we're finding and whether it is in France, going after -- how can our technologies help with nuclear facilities and revamping that or in Germany. How -- whether LNG or the hydrogen push is actually helping us to refocus some of the technologies in that. So we get kind of variance on that kind of micro level for us to be able to decipher the best way for achieving that growth.So that's why we think that the view that we put out in this economic growth engine on how we kind of follow secular trends and leverage things like demand generation obviously, IoT, which we're very excited in terms of accelerating. We've been feeding a lot of new machines in the field and now how we're going to harvest all that packaged care and recurring service work that we can do because we're connecting machines. So there's multiple of places where we can find good growth that as you kind of add all these little buckets of growth kind of create a meaningful good growth momentum for us. Nicole DeBlase: Understood. Thanks Vicente. Vicente Reynal: Yeah. Thank you, Nicole. Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Reynal, I'll turn the call back over to you. Vicente Reynal: Yes. Thank you. I just would like to end by thanking and acknowledging again all of our employees for their hard work, being helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. We're counting on our team to continue to execute, we're counting that we know that IRX continues to be our differentiator. And IRX, as we said, is rooted in our unique ownership model. So again, thanks for listening to our call and appreciate it. Thank you. Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

(NYSE:LYB) Shares Could Be 29% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyondellbasell-industries-n-v-nyse-140022180.html,1691244022,STORY,['LYB'],"[Key InsightsLyondellBasell Industries' estimated fair value is US$135 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityLyondellBasell Industries' US$95.71 share price signals that it might be 29% undervalued The US$100 analyst price target for LYB is 26% less than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.82bUS$3.27bUS$2.97bUS$3.14bUS$3.21bUS$3.27bUS$3.34bUS$3.42bUS$3.49bUS$3.56bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.16%Est @ 2.15%Est @ 2.13%Est @ 2.13%Est @ 2.12%Est @ 2.12% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$2.6kUS$2.8kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.1%) = US$54bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$54b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$23bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$44b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$95.7, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LyondellBasell Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.129. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for LyondellBasell IndustriesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine General Electric’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for General Electric What's The Opportunity In General Electric?According to my valuation model, General Electric seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy General Electric today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $129.30, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because General Electric’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will General Electric generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for General Electric, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? GE seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GE for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on GE should the price fluctuate below its true value.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for General Electric (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable) you should be familiar with.If you are no longer interested in General Electric, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy How Fast Is Valero Energy Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Valero Energy has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. In impressive fashion, Valero Energy's EPS grew from US$17.34 to US$30.87, over the previous 12 months. It's a rarity to see 78% year-on-year growth like that.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While revenue is looking a bit flat, the good news is EBIT margins improved by 3.2 percentage points to 9.9%, in the last twelve months. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Valero Energy's future profits.Story continuesAre Valero Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Valero Energy has a market capitalisation of US$45b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$214m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.5% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Valero Energy, the median CEO pay is around US$12m.Valero Energy offered total compensation worth US$8.4m to its CEO in the year to December 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Does Valero Energy Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Valero Energy's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. The sweetener is that insiders have a mountain of stock, and the CEO remuneration is quite reasonable. The strong EPS improvement suggests the businesses is humming along. Valero Energy certainly ticks a few boxes, so we think it's probably well worth further consideration. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Valero Energy.Although Valero Energy certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

However, it is the only developed country that doesn’t have universal health coverage. Most Americans receive their coverage from a combination of public programs, private insurance, and out-of-pocket payments.Moreover, data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that the country's average life expectancy has dropped to 76.4 years, the lowest level in almost two decades. Per the findings, the decrease in life expectancy was primarily caused by deaths from COVID-19 and drug overdoses, particularly those caused by synthetic opioids like fentanyl.In addition to a short life expectancy at birth, the U.S. struggles with a high prevalence of chronic illnesses, avoidable deaths, and obesity. Obesity, a medical condition in which a person has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or more, is a growing concern in the country, with a prevalence of 41.9% in 2017-2020.Numerous variables, including excessive eating, inactivity, heredity factors, metabolism, culture, and poor dietary choices contribute to obesity, which can have a negative impact on health. Osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some types of cancer are just a few of the major health effects of carrying extra fat.According to the CDC data, obesity rates in 41 U.S. states were more than 30% in 2021. At 25%, Hawaii had the lowest obesity rate, followed by Colorado and Massachusetts, each with 25.1% and 27.4% respectively.Most and Least Healthy States in the U.S.The 2022 America's Health Rankings (AHR) Annual Report by the United Health Foundation identified New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Utah, Maryland, Washington, and Colorado as the top healthiest states in the country, while Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, and Alabama were ranked as the least healthy.Story continuesFor example, aside from having good healthcare system, Hawaii is known for its health-conscious residents, who engage in leisure-time physical activity, have healthy eating habits, and a low proportion of obesity. In a similar vein, residents of Colorado take pleasure in outdoor pursuits like hiking and generally pay attention to their health by consuming nutrient-dense foods. Besides, a high majority of Coloradans—about 93.5%—have health insurance, which is important because it enables people to access the medical and preventive care they need to attain and maintain good health.On the contrary, in West Virginia a sizable proportion of adults don't exercise outside of their regular jobs, and it has the highest prevalence of adult obesity out of all 50 states, at 40.6%. Additionally, the state has one of the highest rates of heart disease-related deaths in the country (223 per 100,000 population).Analysis of the health and wellness market and the upsurge of health consciousness in the United StatesWe reported previously that a survey conducted by Nutrisystem and OnePoll found that more than 70% of Americans were now more health-conscious post the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering how their weight had an impact on their immunity, more than 60% of the respondents were motivated to shed pounds.Furthermore, a survey by McKinsey last year revealed rising US consumer interest in wellness across six domains: health, fitness, nutrition, appearance, sleep, and mindfulness. 50% of consumers reported wellness as a key priority in their daily lives (up significantly from 2020).Meanwhile, a report by Allied Market Research estimates that the global health and wellness market was valued at $4.7 trillion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10.9% from 2022 through 2031, reaching a value of $12.9 trillion at the end of the forecasted period. The increasing prevalence of physical and mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression, are the main drivers of this growth. In 2021, North America dominated the global health and wellness market. Per the report, the region is anticipated to experience the fastest growth in the industry during the projected period.The key market players in the global health and wellness market include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Nestle and Loreal among others.Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods. On July 20, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted earnings for the second quarter of 2023, reporting a Non-GAAP EPS of $2.80, beating market estimates by $0.18. The revenue over the period was $25.53 billion, up 6.4% compared to the revenue over the same period last year.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the largest consumer staples companies in the world. This June, VOOST, a vitamin brand owned by the company, announced the U.S. launch of VOOST Gummies, which deliver on four of the most popular benefits in the vitamins, minerals and supplements category, including Men’s and Women’s Multivitamins, Immunity and B12. The Gummies, fruit-flavored without a sugar coating, meet the changing health and wellness requirements of consumers. However, ironically, the company is also behind many cigarette brands.Having said that, lets take a look at the most health-conscious states in the U.S.25 Most Health-Conscious States in the U.S.Copyright: halfpoint / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyTo compile the list of the most health-conscious states in the U.S., we initially consulted our first key metric, the United Health Foundation's 2022 America's Health Rankings (AHR) Annual Report to see the overall health of all 50 states in the country.We then proceeded to assign a score to each state based on its ranking in the report, creating a list A. For instance, the #1 healthiest state in this report will get a score of 50/50=1, #2 healthiest state will get a score of 49/50=0.98 and so on.We then looked up for our second key metric, obesity rates in all 50 states in 2021, with data courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency of the United States. The states were arranged in ascending order on the basis of their obesity rates, and the same scoring methodology was used to create a list B.Please note that, due to insufficient data, the CDC was unable to provide the obesity rate for Florida. But Florida's Department of Health indicates a 28% obesity rate, so we used this figure.The overall score for each state was calculated by adding up their individual scores in the aforementioned lists. Finally, we sorted the states by their overall scores and identified the 25 most health-conscious states in the U.S. When two states had the same overall scores, we used each state’s obesity rate as a tie-breaker.Don't Miss: 25 Most Health-Conscious Countries in the WorldMost Health-Conscious States in the U.S.25.

To skip our detailed analysis of current market conditions, you can go directly to see the 5 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks To Buy.The markets have been full of surprises so far this year. With rampant inflation and recession concerns, investors expected to see more of a market slowdown in the first half of 2023. Instead, they got hit with a multi-month stock rally, led primarily by large-cap technology stocks piggybacking off of the artificial intelligence boom. At the same time, the Federal Reserve first skipped a rate hike in June, offering some breathing room for the economy. This move was followed by a July rate hike. Throughout this all, the US also narrowly avoided a debt-ceiling crisis, while the global community has been facing rising geopolitical tensions, drastically increased energy and oil prices, and much more.Stock Performance In AugustWith this backdrop in mind, the current market conditions we are seeing are not all too surprising. Some of the stocks that have continued to perform well in this economy primarily include reliable blue chip names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), among several others. At the same time, other companies are also continuing to pull their weight in an effort not to be left in the dust by the competition. However, even the companies that have been doing well have begun to face a slowdown come August. On August 2, for instance, many of the top S&amp;P 500 performers were down by an average of 3%, according to CNBC's Closing Bell for the day.In the face of all this, investors may be worried about where to put their money when no place really gives them a certainty of profit. However, at a time when the economy is slowing down, it becomes increasingly important to note where one can find better investment opportunities, even among beaten-down stocks. In this context, looking at stocks that are traditionally considered to be oversold may make for a smart investment strategy. Chris Grisanti, the Chief Equity Strategist and Senior Portfolio Manager at MAI Capital Management, said something along similar lines in a CNBC interview from April. Here are some of his comments:Story continues""It's a really tough market. I do think the economy is like a car speeding down a cul-de-sac with really no place to go. Things are really, I think, set to slow down over the summer. So what we think, instead of buying broadly or expecting growth in the usual areas, let's find the good companies that have already gotten the stuffing knocked out of them.""Are Oversold Stocks Good Investments?Grisanti went on to describe MAI Capital Management's strategy to take a look at stocks that have been down recently as prospective investment opportunities. This seems to be a long-term strategy whereby investors can really try and get good, reliable, and financially strong companies added to their portfolios at a bargain. Blue chip stocks are, in this way, some of the best names to keep an eye on in a potentially slowing market since these companies are typically considered to be large-cap, reliable, and profitable investments that can offer their shareholders significant long-term returns, provided they stick with them through the tough times. Despite this, we are seeing many blue chip names joining the growing list of oversold stocks this year as investors flee their positions for various reasons.However, we still think that many of these names can act as valuable additions to any investor's portfolio, which is why we have compiled a list of some oversold blue chip stocks to buy heading into August. Considering hedge fund and analyst sentiments surrounding many of these stocks, it is safe to say that they may be some of the best blue chip stocks to buy right now. Many of these names will be found on several lists of top 50 blue chip companies and so on, making them attractive investments to at least consider at this point in time.10 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks To BuyOur MethodologyWe used the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator to pick oversold blue chip stocks for our list. The RSI indicator is a momentum indicator used in the technical analysis of stocks by measuring the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate whether the price of that security is overvalued or undervalued. Stocks with RSI values of over 70 are traditionally considered to be overbought, while those with RSI values under 30 are oversold. We used a stock screener to find blue chip stocks with RSI values under 30 and then ranked them based on this metric, from the highest to the lowest RSI value. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock, using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter.Oversold Blue Chip Stocks To Buy10. Equifax Inc.

Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”Just like Apple Inc.

In the most recent quarter, the shares declined because rent growth is moderating from its strong pace of the last few years.Though 2023 may be a transition year for Extra Space as growth retraces to a more sustainable run-rate and the management team prepares to incorporate Life Storage, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the company and believe the current price of its shares reflects a good portion of this anticipated transition.We believe Extra Space’s management team is excellent. Over the last decade, management has delivered strong occupancy gains, rent growth, and expense control that has led to a cost-of-capital advantage relative to its peers. Management has capitalized on its cost-of-capital advantage relative to its peers by tripling its owned self-storage count since 2010. We believe the management team will continue to create tremendous value for shareholders and believe the long-term growth opportunity for the company remains strong.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks To Buy. Suggested articles:10 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks to Buy10 Oversold Financial Stocks to Buy10 Most Oversold S&amp;P 500 Stocks Right NowDisclosure: None. 10 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Although, when we looked at Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Union Pacific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$9.4b ÷ (US$66b - US$5.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 16%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Transportation industry average of 12% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Union Pacific compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Things have been pretty stable at Union Pacific, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Union Pacific to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Union Pacific is paying out 43% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In a nutshell, Union Pacific has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 71% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Union Pacific that you might find interesting.While Union Pacific may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.
