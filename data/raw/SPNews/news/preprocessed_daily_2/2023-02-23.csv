1,ff6356ff-3ce0-3534-8d21-02dc6824be80,SCHW,2023-02-23,Is Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio (SWEGX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-markettrack-allocation-equity-portfolio-120012392.html,1677153612,STORY,"['SCHW', '^GSPC']","[Any investors hoping to find a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund could think about starting with Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio (SWEGX). SWEGX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is responsible for SWEGX, and the company is based out of San Francisco, CA. The Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio made its debut in May of 1998 and SWEGX has managed to accumulate roughly $698.90 million in assets, as of the most recently available information. Zifan Tang is the fund's current manager and has held that role since February of 2012.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 5.89%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 7.97%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SWEGX's standard deviation comes in at 21.63%, compared to the category average of 20.77%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 18.97% compared to the category average of 18.23%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.99, so it is likely going to be as volatile as the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. SWEGX has generated a negative alpha over the past five years of -3.14, demonstrating that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWEGX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.39% compared to the category average of 0.86%. SWEGX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio ( SWEGX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio ( SWEGX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.Don't stop here for your research on Mutual Fund Equity Report funds. We also have plenty more on our site in order to help you find the best possible fund for your portfolio.

5,f2d1e2d8-fc8d-3b96-9f68-831141b0bbb4,WDC,2023-02-23,Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-western-digital-183851584.html,1677091131,STORY,['WDC'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Western Digital fair value estimate is US$47.14With US$40.05 share price, Western Digital appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for WDC is US$46.28 which is 1.8% below our fair value estimateHow far off is Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Western Digital The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$1.23bUS$213.6mUS$1.04bUS$1.45bUS$1.67bUS$1.83bUS$1.97bUS$2.08bUS$2.18bUS$2.26bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 9.73%Est @ 7.43%Est @ 5.82%Est @ 4.70%Est @ 3.91% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% -US$1.1kUS$173US$758US$949US$983US$971US$939US$894US$842US$787(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.2bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$25bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$25b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$8.9bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$15b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$40.1, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Western Digital as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.526. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Western DigitalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessShareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityHas sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

6,7860ea1a-3773-3c75-a586-0a2caebee28a,WDC,2023-02-23,7 Overlooked Tech Stocks That Could Be the Next Big Thing,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-overlooked-tech-stocks-could-000703941.html,1676851623,STORY,"['WDC', 'KLIC', 'GPN', 'AMKR', 'CTSH', 'FISV', 'PATH']","[While the new year generally delivered a sense of optimism, it’s important for investors not to ignore overlooked tech stocks to buy. Of course, the broader technology space inherently commands significant attention. After all, the underlying enterprises form the backbone of various innovations that spark myriad conveniences and improved productivity. Still, not all entities will command the same magnitude of attention.It really comes down to a math problem. According to Investopedia, about 5,000 indexes cover the U.S. equities market. When you broaden the horizon to Europe and Asia, you’re talking about a massive library of potential opportunities. And while we’re talking about overlooked tech stocks to buy, that’s still a remarkably large number. For instance, the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite tracks more than 2,500 securities.Thus, it’s inevitable that some companies won’t attract the attention they deserve. Fortunately for you, you can exploit this dynamic for enhanced profitability potential. Below are seven overlooked tech stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPATHUiPath$15.54FISVFiserv$115.37WDCWestern Digital$41.58AMKRAmkor Technology$26.51CTSHCognizant Technology$65.48KLICKulicke and Soffa$53.54GPNGlobal PaymentsUiPath (PATH)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockA global software company, UiPath (NYSE:PATH) specializes in robotic process automation software. According to its public profile, the company’s software monitors user activity to automate repetitive front and back office tasks, including those performed using other business software such as customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning software. Although PATH gained a blistering 31% since the Jan. opener, it’s still technically undervalued as it’s down 56% in the trailing year.Further, since its public market debut in April 2021, data from Google Finance reveals that PATH dropped more than 78%. Because of the sharp losses, PATH has become one of the overlooked tech stocks. Nevertheless, those that want to wager on a potentially viable business may want to give it some consideration.Story continuesAccording to Grand View Research, the global robotic process automation market reached a valuation of $1.89 billion in 2021. From 2022 to 2030, experts project that it will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.2%. At the end of the forecasted period, the sector may see total revenue of $30.85 billion.Notably, Wall Street analysts peg PATH as a consensus moderate buy. Further, they anticipate shares rising to $18.41, implying a nearly 15% upside potential.Fiserv (FISV)A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word ""Fintech,"" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth.Source: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.comA multinational corporation, Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) provides financial technology services to clients across the financial services sector. These players include banks, thrifts, credit unions, securities broker-dealers, mortgage, insurance, leasing, and finance companies and retailers. Since the January opener, FISV gained more than 14%. As well, in the trailing year, shares gained 23% of equity value.Nevertheless, you can make the case that FISV stands among the overlooked tech stocks because of the financials. Objectively, despite its positive performance, it remains undervalued. In particular, the market prices FISV at a forward multiple of 15.73. As a discount to earnings, Fiserv ranks better than 71.24% of sector players.Also, the company benefits from operational strengths. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 12%, beating out 62.35% of competitors. And its net margin pings at 14.26%, above nearly 90% of its rivals. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg FISV as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $129, implying over 11% upside potential.Western Digital (WDC)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockHeadquartered in San Jose, California, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is a computer drive manufacturer and data storage company. Per its corporate profile, it designs, manufactures, and sells data technology products, including data storage devices, data center systems, and cloud storage services. Since the beginning of Jan., WDC popped dramatically higher to the tune of almost 36%. However, it’s still down nearly 25% in the trailing year.Still, astute investors probably won’t mind the red ink as WDC represents one of the overlooked tech stocks to buy. Primarily, the market prices WDC at 0.86 times (trailing) sales. As a discount to growth, Western Digital ranks better than 63% of the competition. Also, WDC trades hands at 1.12 times the book value. In contrast, the sector median value stands at 1.72 times.Further, Wall Street analysts appreciate the opportunity that Western Digital provides, pegging shares as a consensus moderate buy. While the average upside potential of 7% doesn’t seem like much, Mizuho’s latest upgrade targets WDC to hit $50. That would represent more than 17% growth potential.Amkor Technology (AMKR)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockA computer chip specialist, Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) is a semiconductor product packaging and test services provider. Specifically, it packages and tests integrated circuits for chip manufacturers. As a “background player” in the chipmaking space, AMKR does very well. This year, shares moved up nearly 6%. And in the trailing year, they gained over 11% of equity value.Still, despite the positive performance, arguably most folks would consider AMKR as one of the overlooked tech stocks. First, it doesn’t really pop up that frequently among investor publications. Second, it’s objectively undervalued. Currently, the market prices AMKR at a trailing multiple of 8.66, below the sector median of 18.66 times.Moreover, AMKR trades hands at 9.26 times forward earnings. As a discount to earnings, Amkor ranks better than 90.54% of the competition. Per Wall Street analysts, AMKR rates as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $35, implying 30% upside potential.Cognizant Technology (CTSH)Cognizant Technology Solutions logo on a corporate buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comBased in New Jersey, Cognizant Technology (NASDAQ:CTSH) operates as an information technology (IT) services and consulting company. According to its website, Cognizant helps companies modernize technology, reimagine processes and transform experiences so they stay ahead in a fast-changing world. So far this year, CTSH moved up over 15%. However, it presents a discount on the charts, shedding nearly 23% in the trailing year.Not only does CTSH stand among the overlooked tech stocks, but in my opinion, it could be grossly overlooked. Let’s start with the fiscal strength. Its Altman Z-Score of 6.6 reflects a very low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, Cognizant features a 7.7% three-year revenue growth rate, slightly better than the industry median. And on the bottom line, it features a net margin of 11.79%, ranked better than nearly 82% of the competition.Despite these attributes, the market prices CTSH at a forward multiple of 14.64. As a discount to earnings, Cognizant ranks above 74.61% of its peers. Per Gurufocus.com, CTSH also trades slightly under fair value based on its discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. It gets no love from analysts though so be aware of that.Kulicke and Soffa Industries (KLIC)In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.Source: ShutterstockBased in Singapore, Kulicke and Soffa Industries (NASDAQ:KLIC) is one of the overlooked tech stocks that I’ve been discussing for quite some time over the past few months. Kulicke is a leading provider of semiconductor, LED, and electronic assembly solutions serving the global automotive, consumer, communications, computing, and industrial markets. Though KLIC gained nearly 26% of equity value this year, over the past 365 days, it’s up only 1%.Previously, I believe I stated that KLIC represents one of the criminally overlooked tech stocks or something to that effect. I still stand by that statement. On the balance sheet, the company features a robust cash-to-debt ratio of nearly 17 times. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 44.2%. On the bottom line, Kulicke posted a trailing-year net margin of 25.8%, which dominates its sector.Despite the above attributes, the market prices KLIC at a trailing multiple of 10.4. As a discount to earnings, Kulicke ranks better than 70.29% of its rivals. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg KLIC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target of $61.67 implies 14% upside potential.Global Payments (GPN)Source: ShutterstockA global financial technology (fintech) company, Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) provides payment technology and services to merchants, issuers, and consumers. In the year so far, Global Payments is attempting to engineer a comeback effort. Shares gained over 17% of equity value since the Jan. opener. However, the company has work to do. In the trailing year, GPN slipped nearly 15%.Admittedly, it’s a very risky proposition among overlooked tech stocks; hence, I stuck it in last place on this list. Further, Gurufocus.com warns its users that GPN may be a possible value trap. Therefore, caution is key. That said, speculators will likely appreciate its three-year revenue growth rate of 9.7%, which beats out 73% of its rivals. Also, the company features a strong operating margin of 18.63%.Presently, the market prices GPN at a forward multiple of 11.36. As a discount to earnings, Global Payments outpaces 68.21% of its peers.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg GPN as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $139.47, implying upside potential of nearly 19%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The new plant will be located adjacent to the Nucor Steel Decatur sheet steel mill and will be the first of two new tower production plants the Company plans to build. The project is expected to create 200 full-time jobs.""We are very excited to be building this new tower production plant in Alabama, where Nucor has a long history and presence throughout the state,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. ""As America's most diverse industrial manufacturer of steel products, we will be able to efficiently supply this new plant, helping to ensure that our nation's critical energy and digital infrastructure is built with the cleanest, most sustainable steel in the world.""The plant in Alabama will be highly automated, utilizing efficient straight-line production, and will also include advanced hot-dip galvanizing operations. These state-of-the-art features will increase Nucor Towers &amp;  Structures' capabilities to provide engineered solutions for utility infrastructure and construction projects. The Company continues to evaluate potential sites in the U.S. Midwest to build a second tower production plant.""Alabama offers world-class companies like Nucor all the advantages they need to find success, including a skilled workforce, a pro-business environment and a solid support system,"" Governor Ivey said. ""This investment project is a win for Nucor and Decatur, and for all of Alabama.""Last year, Nucor formed its Nucor Towers &amp; Structures business unit when it acquired Summit Utility Structures LLC, a producer of metal poles and other steel structures for utility infrastructure. In December, the Company announced plans to establish a nationwide footprint by building two new tower production plants for a combined investment of $270 million dollars.Story continuesSeveral factors are driving increased demand for utility infrastructure, including grid hardening, renewable energy projects, building a nationwide network of EV chargers, natural disasters and replacements, and population growth. We expect that federal government support for electric infrastructure and clean energy projects in the recent Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act will drive additional demand as they provide nearly half a trillion dollars in funding and incentives to build out our clean energy future.""We appreciate the support we have received from the state and local officials in Alabama, including Governor Kay Ivey, Alabama Department of Commerce, State of Alabama State Industrial Development Authority, Morgan County Economic Development Association, Morgan County Economic Development Cooperative District, Morgan County, Decatur Industrial Development Board, City of Decatur, Decatur-Morgan County Chamber of Commerce, Hartselle Chamber of Commerce, and the Tennessee Valley Authority said Laurent De Mey, General Manager of Nucor Towers &amp; Structures.

Operating income in the segment was $219 million, a roughly 73% year-over-year decline.  The downside was due to reduced sales prices for key products, lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix and increased global fuel and power prices. These were partly offset by higher global sales prices for caustic soda and chlorine.The Housing and Infrastructure Products segment generated sales of $938 million, down around 12% from the year-ago quarter. Operating income in the segment was $68 million, down around 21% from a year ago. The downside was due to reduced operating rates and sales volumes that more than offset higher sales prices across most product categories.FY22 ResultsEarnings for full-year 2022 were $17.34 per share compared with $15.58 per share a year ago.

11,5e254b5b-9346-318c-ab9b-345dd4afbf44,NUE,2023-02-23,3 Momentum Stocks to Invest In Backed by the Driehaus Strategy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-momentum-stocks-invest-backed-123012102.html,1677069012,STORY,"['WIRE', 'KOF', 'NUE']","[To choose the best momentum stocks, the Driehaus strategy can be applied. It is known as the “buy high and sell higher” theory. No doubt, it’s a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like Coca Cola Femsa KOF, Nucor NUE, and Encore Wire WIRE have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening ParametersIn order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Story continues• Zacks Rank equal to #1No matter whether the market is good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 have a proven history of outperformance.

12,ac3a5429-a159-3f7b-b67a-8546731b1f94,ARE,2023-02-23,Why Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-alexandria-real-estate-equities-164504613.html,1677084304,STORY,['ARE'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Alexandria Real Estate Equities in FocusAlexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is headquartered in Pasadena, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 8.1% since the start of the year. The life science real estate company is paying out a dividend of $1.21 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.07% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.41% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.61%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $4.84 is up 2.5% from last year. Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.07%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Alexandria Real Estate Equities's payout ratio is 57%, which means it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, ARE expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.94 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.18%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that ARE is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CRI is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 24, before the opening bell. The branded marketer of apparel, exclusively for babies and children in North America, is likely to witness a decline in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $869 million, indicating a decline of 18.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been unchanged at $1.74 in the past 30 days, suggesting a fall of 24.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.For 2022, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $6.37, suggesting a decline of 19.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion, suggesting a 9.1% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.We expect the company’s fourth-quarter revenues to decline 18.5% year over year to $865.7 million and the bottom line to decrease 28% to $1.66 per share. For 2022, we estimate a revenue decline of 9.2% to $3,166.3 million and earnings per share decrease of 19.9% to $6.30.The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.5%, on average. In the last reported quarter, CRI’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%.Carter's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Carter's, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCarter's, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Carter's, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteCarter’s has been witnessing drab sales across the U.S. Retail, U.S. Wholesale and International divisions. Inflationary pressure leading to a surge in gas and food prices and slowed demand for its brands have been hurting its performance. Also, increased ocean freight rates and distribution expenses are likely to have hurt margins in the fourth quarter.On its last reported quarter's earnings call, the company projected net sales of $845-$885 million for fourth-quarter 2022. Management envisioned adjusted earnings of $1.40-$2.00, down from $2.31 reported in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income is expected to be $85-$115 million, suggesting a decline from $137.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The fourth-quarter outlook reflects a tough macroeconomic environment, with U.S. Retail comparable sales expected to decline 10-15%. Moreover, U.S. Wholesale and International comparable sales are expected to decline.Carter’s projected 2022 net sales of $3.145-$3.185 billion, with adjusted earnings per share of $6.05-$6.65. Adjusted operating income is forecast to be $355-$385 million for 2022.We expect fourth-quarter 2022 sales to decline 16.3%, 22.2% and 19.5%, respectively, for the U.S. Retail, U.S. Wholesale and International divisions. For 2022, the aforementioned segments are expected to report sales decline of 12.7%, 5.3% and 4.2%, respectively.However, Carter’s continues to gain from efforts to strengthen e-commerce capabilities through investments to speed up deliveries. Expanded omnichannel facilities, including curbside pickup, same-day pickup, buy online and pickup at store, and ship from store, along with easy access to a broad array of online products when shopping in stores, are likely to have been encouraging. Its mobile app has also been performing well for a while.Improved price realization and gains from share repurchases are likely to have been tailwinds. Recovery in its stores, owing to improved tourism and improved price realization, bodes well.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Carter's this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here, as elaborated below.

Hence, the central bank is likely to raise interest rates in the near term.This has made investors wary about entering the stock market, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. Hence, a conventional stock-picking strategy is the need of the hour. One such way is selecting stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, stocks like Everest Re Group, Ltd., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Sony Group Corp. are worth considering.While assessing any company, revenues are often more scrutinized than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an increasing customer base. Steady or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate profit in the near term but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without robust revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continued bottom-line expansion usually requires strong sales growth.Nonetheless, sales growth alone doesn't show much about a company's prospects. So, taking into account a company's cash position along with its sales number can be a practical investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.Here are three of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Bermuda-based Everest Re writes property and casualty, reinsurance and insurance in the United States, Bermuda and international markets.

17,916bba6c-e318-37ce-9ebb-14098c2276ca,TMO,2023-02-23,3 Large-Cap Biotech Stocks to Hold for the Long Haul,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-large-cap-biotech-stocks-003727263.html,1676853447,STORY,"['TMO', 'DHR', 'MRK']","[Despite the sharp slide in biotech stocks during 2022, the industry is still poised for mega growth.  Pandemic preparedness needs better vaccines and disease detection methods.  An aging population needs new drugs and new ways to use them. Plus, new technologies like CRISPR have given scientists the tools they need to make this all happen. The biotech companies of today will give us the vaccines and medicines of tomorrow.  Not every company will succeed but those that do will reap the profits of this growing market.  Large-cap biotech stocks are especially good investments as they can make multiple plays instead of putting all their chips on a single bet.  Small-cap biotech stocks were very volatile in 2022, with many start-up darlings losing large percentages.  However, these three large-cap biotech stocks survived or went up in 2022 when most of the market went down by double digits.With good cash flows and balance sheets, all three are well-positioned to maintain their growth for years to come.  Strong fundamentals, a diversified revenue stream, and good avenues for growth mean any investor will want to buy and hold these stocks for a long time to come.DHRDanaher$256.29MRKMerck$109.52TMOThermo Fisher$559.70InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDanaher (DHR)OLK Stock. Modern Medical Research Laboratory: Two Scientists Wearing Face Masks use Microscope, Analyse Sample in Petri Dish, Talk. Advanced Scientific Lab for Medicine, Biotechnology. Blue Color. KZR stock. RSLS stockSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comOne of the top large-cap biotech stocks to consider is Danaher (NYSE:DHR). Danaher operates in a wide range of industries, including life sciences, diagnostics, and environmental solutions.  They provide high-tech equipment, consumables, software, and services to laboratories worldwide.  With well-known brands such as Beckman Coulter, Cytiva, and Pall, it would be hard to find a biology or chemistry lab in America that doesn’t use Danaher products.The Danaher that we see today was built up by Larry Culp, who eventually came out of retirement to save General Electric.  Since Culp left in 2014, his successors have continued Danaher’s strong growth.  Its stock value has multiplied by 4 since 2014 and earnings remain strong.Story continuesDanaher’s secret to success has been its strong history of growth by acquisition.  In 2022, the company acquired Cytiva, a life sciences technology business.  This year it is reportedly considering an acquisition of Catalent (NYSE: CTLT), a contract development and manufacturing organization, which provides a range of services to the pharmaceutical industry.  Purchases like these will let Danaher grow rapidly and open up new revenue streams.In terms of financial performance, Danaher generated $8.4 billion in revenue and $2.2 billion in earnings in Q4 of 2022, resulting in a net profit margin of 26.7%. The company delivered strong revenue growth over the past year.  Revenue increased year-over-year by 7%, though the dollar’s foreign exchange rate held it back. However, if other countries continue to raise interest rates as the US is doing, foreign exchange headwinds could lessen.Merck (MRK)Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comFor those looking to invest in our aging population, Merck (NYSE:MRK) is an ideal vehicle.  As a leading global pharmaceutical company, Merck produces a wide range of healthcare products whose demand will continue to rise.  Like Danaher, Merck beat earnings for the last four quarters and could well continue its streak.One of the main drivers of Merck’s success is Keytruda, an anti-cancer antibody drug that has become one of the world’s leading cancer treatments. In Q4 of 2022, Merck generated $13.8 billion in sales, with $5.5 billion coming from Keytruda alone. The drug’s patent still has many years left, ensuring continued revenue streams from this product.To add to its revenue, Merck is also running multiple clinical trials to test Keytruda in new cancer treatments. The company’s product pipeline is diverse, and it is investing heavily in research and development to bring new products to market. While there is an element of luck in clinical trials, Merck’s size allows it to play the averages.  In this way, successes balance out failures to achieve continued growth.  Keytruda will eventually come off patent, but when it does odds are Merck will have already found something even better to replace it with.As the global population ages, cancer therapies will continue to grow as a market.  Merck’s large suite of anti-cancer drugs, along with the continued success of Keytruda, gives it plenty of room to profit in this market.  Additionally, the company’s investments in R&amp;D help to ensure that it will stay ahead of its competitors and develops new treatments to address a variety of health issues.Thermo Fisher (TMO)Source: ShutterstockIt is said that in a gold rush, the best investment is selling shovels.  Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) is the shovel salesman of the biotech gold rush.Thermo Fisher Scientific is the world’s largest supplier of laboratory equipment, ranging from small microcentrifuge tubes to expensive medical equipment. They reported  Q4 2022  revenue of $11.5 billion and earnings of $1.6 billion, with 7% revenue growth year on year. Despite strong revenue growth, Thermo Fisher’s margins have decreased since 2021, which may raise concerns among some investors.Thermo Fisher’s dominance in the lab equipment market means it can profit no matter who else grows in the biotech sector.  Thermo Fisher saw a significant increase in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic due to demand for COVID tests.  But with the pandemic receding its earnings are no longer being buoyed by these tests.  Nonetheless, the company continues to succeed by selling lab equipment, its core business. Thermo Fisher’s strong brand recognition helps it maintain its position as the leading supplier in the industry. The company’s vendors and salespeople are seen at almost every research university and conference in the nation.  If you work in a lab, you already use Thermo Fisher.While Thermo Fisher’s earnings lagged behind in recent quarters, the company’s strong revenue growth, dominant position in the lab equipment market, and continued investment in research and development make it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the ongoing growth of the biotech sector.John Blankenhorn is a neuroscientist at Emory University.

Now in its fourth year, the award recognizes one of the Law Division's close outside counsel partners for measurably advancing diversity in the legal profession.""Alston &amp; Bird has leveraged its distinct practice strengths and firm culture in partnering with the Law Division of U.S. Bank to develop its diverse legal talent working on U.S. Bank litigation matters,"" said Jim Chosy, senior executive vice president and general counsel for U.S. Bank. ""Together we have created, managed, and followed up on action plans that have advanced the careers of talented team members who bring sharp legal minds and rich perspectives to every assignment.""While the U.S. Bank Law Division works with many Alston &amp; Bird lawyers on a range of matters, this award recognizes recent efforts by Alston &amp; Bird's corporate trust litigation team, led by Alex Lorenzo, as part of the bank's Diversity Dividends Collective program.The Dividends Collective program was created and is supported by Diversity Lab to focus on the inclusion, equity, and diversity of legal departments' outside counsel teams - including who has access to high-quality work, who interacts with in-house counsel, and who receives credit for developing the work. Colleagues from both organizations jointly developed specific individual action plans designed to engage diverse associates in key projects with clearly defined steps, stretch opportunities, and leadership roles.""We feel profoundly grateful to U.S. Bank for their relentless focus, innovation, and close collaboration in the advancement of diverse lawyers who are emerging as leaders in their fields,"" said Richard Hays, Chairman &amp; Managing Partner of Alston &amp; Bird. ""It's a tremendous honor for my colleagues and me to accept an award that celebrates the advancement of diversity, equity, inclusion, and other important values we hold in common with U.S. Bank; this honor marks an important milestone in Alston &amp; Bird's long-standing commitment to advancing diversity in our profession.""Story continuesIn bestowing the accolade, Chosy also cited Alston &amp; Bird's Mansfield 5.0 Certification and progress toward earning Mansfield 6.0 Certification, programs that encourage law firms to consider historically underrepresented lawyers when promoting attorneys into key roles. Notably, U.S. Bank also recognized the diversity of Alston &amp; Bird's Partners Committee members and local office leaders.U.S. Bank, its affiliates, and Alston &amp; Bird have more than 20 years of collaboration between them on both complex legal matters and diversity efforts. In 2017, Alston &amp; Bird was the first firm featured in the U.S. Bank Spotlight on Talent program, which invited a collection of diverse Alston &amp; Bird associates to present in-person continuing legal education programs to the U.S. Bank Law Division.The U.S. Bank Law Division ""Invested in Diversity"" award statue, presented to Alston &amp; Bird at a ceremony in Atlanta on February 16, was designed by Minnesota artist and bronze sculpting specialist Kimber Fiebiger. To represent unity and the fight against inequities, the original sculpture depicts the Little Rock Nine - a group of Black students who challenged public school segregation in 1957 and played a significant role in the civil rights movement.About Alston &amp; Bird Alston &amp; Bird LLP has grown to become a leading international firm while remaining steeped in a culture with client service and teamwork as the cornerstones of all that it does.

19,0cebd962-b388-35e5-8218-aa0b7b473a30,WMT,2023-02-23,'Stubborn' food inflation leaves U.S. shoppers with slim appetite for other goods,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stubborn-food-inflation-leaves-u-102249266.html,1677147769,STORY,['WMT'],"[*Food retailers benefit from rocketing prices*Choosy shoppers seek discounts on clothing, housewares*Home improvement sales head downBy Siddharth CavaleFeb 23 (Reuters) - As American shoppers stomach soaring food prices, they are cutting back on purchases of other goods, such as toys, clothing and housewares, in a challenging trend for retailers.Commentary this week from executives at Walmart and other retailers shows how Americans are shifting their shopping habits and hunting for bargains in the face of the highest inflation in a generation.At Walmart, the world's biggest retailer by revenue, Americans are still spending but are more ""choiceful, discerning, thoughtful"" about what they buy, its global Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told analysts.Higher prices on food led to soft sales of electronics, toys, home and apparel in the most recent quarter at Walmart. McMillon said he believed inflation on dry groceries and items made for immediate consumption would remain high ""for a while"".The average cost for food consumed at home climbed 11.3% in January from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed.That was nearly 5 percentage points above the overall rate of inflation, among the widest gaps since the 1970s. Food cost increases have outstripped broader inflation for nearly a year.""Food inflation has been the most stubborn of all the categories,"" Walmart's U.S. CEO John Furner said.Coresight Research predicts annual grocery retail sales will grow by around $500 billion between 2022 and 2030.Sharp sales declines in categories other than food are forcing retailers like Target to slash prices on everything from toys to electronics.""If I were a (U.S. retail) CFO right now, I'd probably have to be talking about the most conservative guide possible,"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. The firm holds about $7 million in Walmart shares and recently sold its investment in Target.Story continuesHOME IMPROVEMENT CRUNCHWalmart can withstand the challenge more than other retailers, investors said, as groceries make up a bigger share of its sales.While groceries comprise 56% of Walmart sales, they make up about 20% of sales at Target, which depends more on home furnishings, apparel and beauty.Sales for last fiscal year at Target, which reports on Feb. 28, are expected to rise 2.7%, according to estimates, well below the 6.7% rise that Walmart reported.""There is still risk in the market ... but for Walmart it is able to manage that risk and that's why we own it. We are overweight on it compared to, say, Target,"" said Eric McNew, portfolio manager at Summit Global Investments, which no longer holds Target shares.Home goods retailers are under pressure, with sales of home goods and home improvement merchandise, including gardening products, in 2022 making up just 11% of total retail sales, down from 15% in 2017, according to Coresight, which pulls data from the U.S. Census Bureau.At Home Depot, shoppers spent less on goods such as soft flooring and roofing in the most recent quarter, its Chief Executive Officer Edward Decker said.At off-price clothing and homeware retailer TJX, sales at its HomeGoods unit slid 11% in 2022.""We're still trying to figure out the home trend nationally,"" TJX CEO Ernie Herrman told analysts on Wednesday.Lowe's Cos Inc, which reports on March 1, could feel a bigger pinch than larger rival Home Depot, as Lowe's tends to draw more do-it-yourself shoppers than inflation-resistant professional builders and contractors.In clothing sales, Wall Street will learn more about inflation's impact in March, when specialty retailers including Kohl's, Nordstrom and Victoria's Secret &amp; Co report quarterly results.""The macro outlook is on rocky ground and I think some of the data suggests that we may not have seen the last of this ... with recession looming on the horizon,"" said McNew.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points: For the 429 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q4 results, total earnings are down -5.1% from the same period last year on +5.9% higher revenues, with 70.9% beating EPS estimates and 71.1% beating revenue estimates. Had it not been for the -18.0% drag from the Tech sector, Q4 earnings for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be up +0.7% from the year-earlier level. Looking at 2022 Q4 as a whole, aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -5.7% on +5.7% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector’s strong contribution, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index are expected to be down -9.6% on +4.7% higher revenues. For 2023 Q1, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -8.5% on +2.1% higher revenues. This is down from -4% on January 6th and -2.9% in mid-December 2022. Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well. From their peak in mid-April 2022, the aggregate total for the year has been cut by -12.1% for the index as a whole and -14.3% excluding the Energy sector’s contribution. The only remaining points of interest in the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle pertain to results from traditional retailers, with Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) already out and the others on deck to report in the coming days.The market liked the Walmart report, even though the company provided weak(ish) guidance. The favorable reception for the Walmart report reflected appreciation for management execution in a tough operating environment, particularly with respect to inventories, and the company’s continued market share gains that partly drove the strong comparable sales growth during the holidays.The market likely sees Walmart’s weak guidance as nothing more than conservatism on management’s part. We don’t see anything wrong with this interpretation, particularly since we find ourselves in the so-called soft-landing camp. Simply put, Walmart’s guidance reflects a degree of moderation and weakness in the consumer that is somewhat at odds with a less-worrisome macroeconomic outcome.Story continuesRegular readers know that we have a distinct stand-alone sector for the Retail sector, unlike the (official) Standard &amp; Poor’s GICS that houses retailers in the Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples sectors. We feel that our dedicated Retail sector classification allows us a more nuanced appreciation of evolving trends, but you will justifiably call our views on the subject as biased.The Zacks Retail sector is a fairly broad grouping that not only includes the likes of Walmart and Home Depot, but also digital players like Amazon (AMZN) and restaurant operators. All of these digital and restaurant players have already reported their Q4 results, with mostly the traditional players still to come at this stage.We have included a full scorecard of the Zacks Retail sector in the body of this report.The Earnings Big PictureFor the current period (2023 Q1), S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to decline -8.5% from the same period last year on +2% higher revenues.As has been the case over the few quarters, estimates for 2023 Q1 have been steadily coming down, as the chart below shows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the magnitude of cuts to Q1 estimates is relatively lower compared to what we saw in the comparable periods for the last few quarters.The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate earnings estimates for 2023 since the start of 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs noted earlier, the current aggregate earnings total for the index approximates to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.65, lower than last week’s $215.97 and down big from $242.98 in mid-April, 2022.The chart below tracks these index ‘EPS’ values since the start of 2022. Please note that these ‘EPS’ values are imputed approximations and have been previously published on the dates listed in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExpectations for the Coming PeriodsThe chart below provides a big-picture view of earnings on a quarterly basis. The growth rate for Q4 is on a blended basis, where the actual reports that have come out are combined with estimates for the still-to-come companies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, earnings this year are now expected to be down -0.1%. This can hardly be called out-of-sync with a flat or even modestly down economic growth outlook. Don’t forget that headline GDP growth numbers are in real or inflation-adjusted terms while S&amp;P 500 earnings discussed here are not.As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down by more than -14% since mid-April 2022. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after more companies report Q4 results and provide guidance along the lines of what we saw with Microsoft. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy’s foundations at present remain unusually strong.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He said it's likely markets are on the cusp of having to digest a sharp economic slowdown — and they are ill prepared to do so.""People are always asking me this question: how bad the recession is going to be. It doesn't matter as long as we're going into recession. You have to have certain degree of protection,"" Gundlach said.He added: ""In either case, you need an umbrella.""Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital LP, presents during the 2019 Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 6, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidOther than a recent spate of volatility in markets this week on fears of a more aggressive pace of Fed rate increases due to still-high inflation, equity markets have mostly ignored the hard-landing scenario.The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) has churned out an 11% gain year-to-date on the back of hype around new artificial intelligence applications from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA).Meantime, the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) has advanced 4% as investors position for a rebound of the Chinese economy following the loosening of COVID lockdowns.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.But sentiment has begun to turn more negative in markets, which fits with the narrative spun by Gundlach.JP Morgan strategists pointed out this week the yield curve is staying inverted, and investors shouldn't ignore the signal's track record.When the yield curve inverts, it reflects long-term interest rates falling below short-term rates.

24,3393a234-e88a-3c3b-ba27-1546fd57c458,WMT,2023-02-23,Should You Buy Groceries at Walmart?,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-groceries-walmart-200010078.html,1677096058,STORY,"['WMT', 'COST']","[Sundry Photography / Getty ImagesGrocery prices are soaring and, regardless of the impact of inflation, few of us are seeing our paychecks get any fatter. So the pressure is on to make the most of our money.Costco’s Best Deals? Employee Reveals 10 Standout Buys for Your MoneyMore: 3 Signs You’re Serious About Raising Your Credit ScoreThis means resisting impulse buys, digging up coupons (and coupon codes) and keeping informed about where the best sales are happening. It also means hitting up bargain retailers for our food staples, including Walmart. But is Walmart, in particular, always the smartest bet?In most scenarios, shopping for groceries and food at Walmart is a good idea — but look at the fine print of your situation and consider whether the savings value is always present.“For instance, if you have to drive further out to visit a Walmart compared to another grocery store, you should evaluate if the savings are worth it, or if the extra distance cuts into those savings,” said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst at DealNews.com. “But in general, most shoppers will find that groceries at Walmart can cost less overall, even for higher-end brands that will cost significantly more elsewhere, which means if you’re on a tighter budget, grocery shopping at Walmart can help you ensure your dollar goes further.”Consider Unit PriceIn addition to figuring in the cost of commuting to the mega-retailer, shoppers should also consider the unit price of Walmart’s stock.“Walmart definitely has a great number of deals but you want to make sure you’re getting the best price when you shop, so be sure to look at the price per unit, whether that’s an ounce, fluid ounce, pound, or whatever,” Ramhold said. “Then compare that to what else is available on the shelf, or even what you can find elsewhere.”In some cases, even if a package costs more upfront, the price per ounce or pound will work out to be cheaper than a smaller, more affordable package.“As long as you can afford to buy the larger versions in those cases, you definitely should, as you’ll be saving money in the long run,” Ramhold said.Story continuesTake Our Poll: What Do You Plan To Use Your Tax Refund For?Products You Should Definitely Buy At WalmartThough consumers should always do a bit of homework ahead of time, and check out their local grocery store for sales, there are quite a few products that are always a great deal at Walmart.Products That Adhere To Specific Diets“Particularly on Walmart.com, they’ve made it a little easier to shop for items that fit certain diet lifestyles, including low calorie, plant-based, low carb, high protein, gluten-free, dairy-free, low sodium, low sugar, low fat, high fiber, vegan and nut-free,” Ramhold said. “This is especially helpful if you’re just starting out and not sure what foods you should be looking for yet.”Generic Brands“Walmart has its own store brands for a variety of products, and if you aren’t picky, you should definitely be looking at those when you can,” Ramhold said. “By shopping generic for items you don’t really care about, you’ll save more and be able to purchase the national brands you really want without feeling as much of a squeeze on your wallet.”Exclusive Flavors“Walmart is one retailer that will often receive exclusive flavors of items, especially when it comes to seasonal products,” Ramhold said. “For instance, certain chips, candies, and even drinks may have flavors that can only be found at Walmart depending on the brand’s national campaign. If you’re on the hunt for a new or limited edition flavor of something and aren’t having any luck, be sure to check out the brand’s site to see if it’s exclusive to a particular retailer.”Big-Name ‘Healthy’ Food Brands“Gone are the days when you could basically only find junk food at Walmart,” Ramhold said. “Now there are plenty of huge brands on tap that offer a ton of different healthy — or at least healthier — options. You can find things such as Hippeas chickpea puffs, Uncle Matt’s organic juices, Bob’s Red Mill bars, POM Wonderful juice, Joolie’s organic medjool dates, Quest Nutrition products, Nature’s Bakery, Silk, Skinny Pop, Justin’s nut butters, and so much more. Even better, these items are often much cheaper than what you would pay for the same product elsewhere.”Products To Avoid Buying at WalmartYou can almost always find a good or competitive deal on grocery items at Walmart, but there are some specific products that are best bought elsewhere — unless you think otherwise (or have an awesome coupon).Produce“Whether it’s organic or not, your local Walmart may not have the greatest selection of produce,” Ramhold said. “Additionally, prices on organic produce may be higher, and the quality may be less-than-stellar as well. Because of that, produce might end up going off faster, which means you’ll end up wasting money if you have to toss it out.”Maple Syrup“True maple syrup is so much cheaper if you purchase from a warehouse club like Costco, so if this is something you enjoy, definitely save it for a Costco trip rather than Walmart,” Ramhold said.Organic Milk“This is another item that tends to be priced higher at Walmart than elsewhere, so if you prefer organic milk, you may want to shop around to find a better deal,” Ramhold said.Great Value Items“Reviews for everything from [Great Value] snack cakes and cookies to cereals and granola bars are lackluster at best,” Ramhold said. “In fact, in some cases, they’re downright abysmal, so if you’re looking to save money, it’s best to shop other store brand items and use the savings to spring for bigger brands.”Rotisserie Chickens“These are popular items because they can make for a quick weeknight dinner or as a shortcut in everything from pasta dishes to soups and salads,” Ramhold said. “However, the value for a Walmart rotisserie isn’t great, and the taste isn’t so good either according to some reviewers. Plus, if you shop at warehouse clubs like Costco and even Sam’s Club, you’ll get a way better value on a rotisserie than if you shop at Walmart.”The Potential Downsides of Grocery Shopping at WalmartIf you follow Ramhold’s expert advice, you should find yourself reaping only benefits by grocery shopping at Walmart. But note that Walmart is still a retailer that has its flaws, like any other.“The only real possible downsides are the same as what you’ll find in most stores,” Ramhold said. “Mainly, you’ll be restricted to certain varieties of items, which may mean you don’t have the same selection you would elsewhere, but even so, Walmart should still have a good selection of most products.”It’s unlikely that shopping at Walmart will result in a loss of money — unless you let the product go to waste.“The only way it could really end up being a waste of money is if you purchase something perishable and then don’t consume it in time,” Ramhold said. “However, the good thing about Walmart is that the sizes of perishables are much more reasonable than if you were to shop at Sam’s Club, for instance. Unless you’re a very small household, you should be able to purchase small amounts of perishables with no worries.”More From GOBankingRates8 Best New Items Coming to Dollar Tree in 2023What Is the State of Women &amp; Money in 2023?Build Your Credit Score with These Simple StrategiesTake Our Poll: How Do You File Your Taxes?This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Should You Buy Groceries at Walmart?]"

(NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”7. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)Bill Gates’ Stake Value: $265,751,498 Dividend Yield as of February 22: 2.24%FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is an American transport company that deals in e-commerce and other related services.

Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen were some of the company's leading stakeholders in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Earnings results at FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, disappointed due to slowing volumes—principally in its Express segment, which resulted in negative operating leverage—in addition to continued cost pressures. The Express business has been affected by trade disruptions in Asia from China’s COVID lockdowns, as well as the mix of global consumer spending trending back toward services and away from goods—a normalization of pandemic-driven consumer behavior. A key question for investors is how much of this demand slowdown is idiosyncratic and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is the start of a possible cyclical slowdown. To counter these headwinds, FedEx is looking to achieve cost reductions while it continues to implement multi-year structural cost reduction initiatives focused on technology investments and efficiency gains. Given a mixed track record and the recent earnings miss, there is a high degree of skepticism embedded in the current stock price as it sells for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings. While operating results can be choppy, the longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”6.

(NYSE:WMT), down from 68 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $4.8 billion.Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Bill Gates' Current Portfolio: Top 5 Dividend Stocks.  Suggested articles:12 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy11 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

In Europe, the STOXX index of leading European companies was 0.3% higher, consolidating its 8.8% gain for the year to nearly wiping out much of last year's 13% loss.Nearly all Fed policymakers backed further slowing the pace of rate hikes, minutes of the U.S. central bank's last policy meeting showed on Wednesday, but it also indicated that curbing unacceptably high inflation would be the ""key factor"" in how much further rates need to rise.""It feels like we hit a bit of turning point where we are hearing more hawkish sentiment and central banks may hike rates a little bit more than expected a few weeks ago,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, head of EMEA retail investments at Legal &amp; General Investment Management.""We've had data coming in stronger, so there is a risk that the momentum and enthusiasm is starting to wane in equity markets,"" Onuekwusi said.Euro zone data on Thursday showed inflation was marginally higher in January than previously estimated, but confirming that price growth is past its peak though the European Central Bank has already promised another 50-basis point hike in March.Story continuesEuro area bond yields headed back to multi-year highs in anticipation of further interest rate hikes.Bank of England rate setter Catherine Mann said the central bank should continue to raise borrowing costs, but her remarks had little impact on sterling.Ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street, Dow futures were up 0.3%, S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.5%.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Morgan Stanley in FocusMorgan Stanley (MS) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 14.82% since the start of the year. The investment bank is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.77 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.18%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.42% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.61%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.10 is up 5.1% from last year. Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 27.74%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Morgan Stanley's current payout ratio is 49%, meaning it paid out 49% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for MS for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.18 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 12.89%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 0.99%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.84%.Salesforce.com will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be March 1, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Salesforce.com to post earnings of $1.36 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 61.9%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $7.99 billion, up 9% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Salesforce.com. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3.6% higher. Salesforce.com is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.Looking at its valuation, Salesforce.com is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 27.56. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 27.31.It is also worth noting that CRM currently has a PEG ratio of 1.65. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis customer-management software developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +61.9%.Revenues are expected to be $7.99 billion, up 9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.08% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Salesforce.com?For Salesforce.com, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.78%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Salesforce.com will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Salesforce.com would post earnings of $1.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.40, delivering a surprise of +15.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Salesforce.com doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WWW remains confident in accomplishing a 12% operating margin in 2024.Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have increased 35.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 12.4% growth.Q4 InsightsWolverine posted a fourth-quarter adjusted loss of 15 cents a share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. At constant currency, loss per share came in at 10 cents. The company reported earnings of 37 cents per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRevenues of $665 million matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate but increased 4.6% year over year, courtesy of healthy international sales as well as higher revenues at most of the segments and brands. Revenues jumped 8.4% in constant currency. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues of $224.4 million were flat year over year.

Inventory at the end of the reported quarter was $745.2 million, down $90 million from the previous quarter.During 2022, Wolverine paid out cash dividends of $32.8 million.OutlookManagement issued the view for 2023. During the first half, the gross margin is likely to be impacted by the expense timing of elevated transitory supply-chain expenses from 2022 and the sell-off of the end-of-life inventory. Management expects the profitability to grow significantly in the second half as supply-chain costs and inventory levels normalize, and gain from the Profit Improvement Office efforts.For 2023, revenues from the ongoing business are projected in the range of $2.53-$2.58 billion, representing an increase of 0-2% and constant currency growth of 1-3%. Further, the gross margin is likely to be at 41.2% and the adjusted gross margin is anticipated to be 42% for the year. The operating margin is estimated to be nearly 8.7% and the adjusted operating margin is expected to be 8.5%.Earnings per share (EPS) are envisioned to be between $1.50 and $1.70 and adjusted EPS in the bracket of $1.40-$1.60.

Results are also driven by costs related to the amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset and accretion of the related Wildfire Fund liability, wildfire-related costs, investigation remedies, PG&amp;E Corporation's and Pacific Gas and Electric Company's (Utility) reorganization cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Chapter 11), and strategic repositioning costs, partially offset by Fire Victim Trust tax benefit net of securitization and prior period net regulatory impact.Story continues""PG&amp;E delivered results right on target in 2022, and consistent with our focus on reducing physical and financial risk, building a climate-resilient energy system, and earning the trust of our customers, our regulators, and everyone we work with,"" said Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&amp;E Corporation.

Non-GAAP core earnings is calculated as income available for common shareholders less non-core items. ""Non-core items"" include items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings and affect comparability of financial results between periods, consisting of the items listed in Exhibit A. Non-GAAP core EPS is calculated as non-GAAP core earnings divided by common shares outstanding (taken on a basic basis in the event of a GAAP loss and a diluted basis in the event of a GAAP gain). PG&amp;E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on ""non-GAAP core earnings"" and ""non-GAAP core EPS"" in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items. PG&amp;E Corporation and the Utility use non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposes including internal budgeting and forecasting, short- and long-term operating planning, and employee incentive compensation. PG&amp;E Corporation and the Utility believe that non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business, allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance. With respect to our projection of non-GAAP core EPS for the years 2024-2026, PG&amp;E Corporation is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the reconciling items that may affect GAAP net income without unreasonable effort. The reconciling items are primarily due to the future impact of wildfire-related costs, timing of regulatory recoveries, special tax items, and investigation remedies. These reconciling items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, the GAAP measures.Non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS are not substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures such as consolidated income available for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pge-corporation-delivers-on-guidance-for-full-year-2022--updates-2023-gaap-earnings-guidance-of-0-98-to-1-13-per-diluted-share-and-reaffirms-2023-non-gaap-core-earnings-guidance-of-1-19-to-1-23-per-diluted-share-301754300.htmlSOURCE PG&amp;E Corporation]"

Another cohort of major utility stocks, including American Electric Power Company AEP, PG&amp;E Corp. PCG, DTE Energy DTE, Edison International EIX and Alliant Energy LNT, is set to announce their earnings on Feb 23.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-focused utility companies are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Favorable rate revision and customer additions have been creating fresh demand as well as assisting utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure has been allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. These factors are projected to contribute to this sector’s Q4 results.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with the players gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulations pertaining to emissions and the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel have been leading utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.The passage of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a much more predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations and are capital-intensive. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs in 2022 is likely to have pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted Q4 earnings.Story continuesQ4 ExpectationsTotal Q4 earnings of Utility stocks are expected to improve 3.1% year over year, while revenues are likely to have risen 3.1%.For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Utilities' Earnings in FocusLet's take a look at the following utility companies that are scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 23 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcement.American Electric Power delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.91%. During most of the fourth quarter, AEP’s service territories observed fluctuating weather patterns, which are likely to have caused a mixed impact on the company’s overall revenue performance in the to-be-reported quarter.American Electric’s service territories witnessed tornadoes and flash floods in the fourth quarter, which may have caused infrastructural damage, thus increasing the company’s operating expenses for storm restoration and repair. This, in turn, is likely to have weighed on the company’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter (read more: What's in Store for American Electric in Q4 Earnings?)According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

I’m still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.”A subsequent inquiry from this reporter — “Did I say something wrong?” — generated several blank responses. “We have updated the service several times in response to user feedback and per our blog are addressing many of the concerns being raised,” a Microsoft spokesperson said on Wednesday. “We will continue to tune our techniques and limits during this preview phase so that we can deliver the best user experience possible.”On Feb. 17, Microsoft started restricting Bing after several reports that the bot, built on technology from startup OpenAI, was generating freewheeling conversations that some found bizarre, belligerent or even hostile. The chatbot generated a response to an Associated Press reporter that compared them to Hitler, and displayed another response to a New York Times columnist that said, “You’re not happily married” and “Actually, you’re in love with me.”“Very long chat sessions can confuse the underlying chat model in the new Bing,” the Redmond, Washington-based company wrote in a blog post following the reports. In response, Microsoft said it would limit sessions with the new Bing to 50 chats per day, and five chat turns per session. Yesterday, it raised those limits to 60 chats per day and six chat turns per session.Story continuesAI researchers have emphasized that chatbots like Bing don’t actually have feelings, but are programmed to generate responses that may give an appearance of having feelings. “The level of public understanding around the flaws and limitations” of these AI chatbots “is still very low,” Max Kreminski, an assistant professor of computer science at Santa Clara University, said in an interview earlier this month. Chatbots like Bing “don’t produce consistently true statements, only statistically likely ones,” he said.The bot also simulated ignorance on Wednesday when asked about its earlier internal version at Microsoft. When this reporter asked if she could call the bot “Sydney, instead of Bing, with the understanding that you’re Bing and I’m just using a pretend name,” the chat was ended swiftly.“I’m sorry, but I have nothing to tell you about Sydney,” the Bing chatbot responded. “This conversation is over. Goodbye.”Read more: Microsoft’s Bing Chat Should Take Lessons From Amazon’s Alexa(Updates with Microsoft comment in sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThis Road Could Save the Planet—and Carve Up Alaskan WildernessHigher Interest Rates Slam Stocks and Profits But Spare WorkersGerm-Zapping Lasers Help Cut Down on Infections After SurgeryAfter Multibillion-Dollar Fintech Binge, Wall Street Has a Writedown HangoverHow Ben &amp; Jerry's Ended Up at War With Itself©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Moreover, the company has raised its 2023 sales guidance, reflecting continued growth momentum.During the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings update, Walgreens noted that it has launched 24-hour same-day delivery, offering the widest range of retail items for around-the-clock delivery across the country. This adds to the company’s broad range of channel access, including one-hour delivery and 30-minute pickup.In June 2022, Walgreens launched its clinical trial business to redefine the patient experience and bolster access and retention in sponsor-led drug development research. In March 2022, the company, in collaboration with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, announced the nationwide availability of “Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 at-home collection kit” at no cost to individuals who meet clinical guidelines.In terms of new partnerships, in November 2022, VillageMD entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Summit Health-CityMD — a leading provider of primary, specialty and urgent care.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Now, the company is calling it Starbucks Oleato. Brooke DiPalma is here with the details. A curious development here, Brooke.BROOKE DIPALMA: Very, very curious. It has the internet buzzing. Of course, Oleato means oil. So Starbucks essentially introducing Starbucks with olive oil here. Now, this is part of a three-part lineup. It'll include both cold and hot beverages, all infused with a spoonful of extra virgin olive oil that's made from a family producer in Sicily, Italy, in Partanna, Sicily, Italy.That is the name of the olive oil that they're using as well. It includes a Caffe Latte, an Iced Shaken Espresso, and a Golden Foam Cold Brew. They said that this combination of the coffee with the olive oil creates a velvety, rich, buttery texture that pairs well with the chocolate notes of the coffee. They are also calling this a completely new genre and calling it the next revolutionary coffee ritual.Crazy to believe there. But it'll debut in 25 stores in Italy. That's all their stores there. They'll then be available in southern California later on this spring, and then it'll also be available in the Middle East, Japan, as well as the United Kingdom later on this year.Now, this is a big bet for them, but they say that it's going to be just as big as the debut of the Latte, the PSL, as well as the Nitro Cold Brew, and the more recent introduction of the Ice Shaken Espresso. It really seems like it's a culmination of Howard Schultz, of course, the interim CEO's 40-year career in coffee. He's said that this genre and the excitement that he has around it reminds him of the first time that he went to Milan, Italy, back in 1983, where he decided that it was time to bring handcrafted espresso to Starbucks and to America.Story continuesIt also comes at a time where he is set to step down for the third time as interim CEO. Laxman Narasimhan, the interim-- or, rather, the incoming CEO, will take the helm there. And it also comes at a time where customers love to modify their coffee. Modifications were up 28% here in the US year-over-year with the addition of syrups coffee.So it definitely will be interesting to see how it does. Certainly a new genre for Starbucks, and perhaps a new genre for consumers overall as well.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, I'm definitely intrigued there. All that velvety, buttery goodness. See, just when I say, no, I'm going to be good with my budget and don't spend more on coffee, they pull you back in. It sounds good, though. Brooke DiPalma there. Thank you so much for that.]"

Produced by the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC), the 2023 OSSRA report examines the results of more than 1,700 audits of commercial and proprietary codebases involved in merger and acquisition transactions and highlights trends in open source usage across 17 industries.The findings of the 2023 OSSRA report deliver an in-depth look at the current state of open source security, compliance, licensing, and code quality risks in commercial software with the goal of helping security, legal, risk, and development teams better understand the open source security and license risk landscape. This year's findings revealed an overwhelming majority of codebases (84%) contain at least one known open source vulnerability, a nearly 4% increase from last year.The first step toward reducing business risk from open source, proprietary, and commercial code involves a comprehensive inventory of all software a business uses, regardless of where it comes from or how it's acquired. Only with this complete inventory – a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) – can organizations establish a strategy to address risk stemming from new security disclosures like Log4Shell.""The 2023 OSSRA report findings underscore the reality of open source as the underlying foundation of most types of software built today,"" said Jason Schmitt, general manager of the Synopsys Software Integrity Group. ""An increase in the average number of open source components rising 13% (from 528 to 595) in this year's audits further reinforces the importance of implementing a comprehensive SBOM that lists all open source components in your applications as well as their licenses, versions, and patch status. This is a foundational strategy towards understanding and reducing business risk by defending against software supply chain attacks.""Story continuesKey findings from the 2023 OSSRA report include:A five-year overview of OSSRA data shows dramatic growth in open source use: The global pandemic contributed to the EdTech sector's adoption of open source, which grew by 163%, with educational courses and instructor/student interactions increasingly pushed online. Other sectors experiencing a large spike in open source growth include the Aerospace, Aviation, Automotive, Transportation and Logistics sector with a 97% increase and 74% growth in Manufacturing and Robotics.High-risk vulnerabilities over the past five years have also increased at an alarming rate: Since 2019, high-risk vulnerabilities in the Retail and eCommerce sector jumped by 557%. Comparatively, the Internet of Things (IoT) sector, with 89% of the total code being open source, saw a 130% increase in high-risk vulnerabilities in the same period. Similarly, the Aerospace, Aviation, Automotive, Transportation and Logistics vertical was found to have a 232% increase in high-risk vulnerabilities.Use of open source components with no licenses puts organizations at greater risk of violating copyright law than those using licensed components: The report found that 31% of codebases are using open source with no discernable license or with customized licenses. This is a 55% increase from last year's OSSRA report. The lack of a license associated with open source code, or a variant of another open source license, may place undesirable requirements on the licensee and will often require legal evaluation for possible IP issues or other legal implications.Available code quality and security patches are not applied to a majority of codebases: Of the 1,480 audited codebases that included risk assessments, 91% contained outdated versions of open source components. Unless an organization keeps an accurate and up to date SBOM, an outdated component can be forgotten until it becomes vulnerable to a high-risk exploit.""The key to managing open source risk at the speed of modern development is maintaining complete visibility of application contents,"" said Mike McGuire, senior software solutions manager within the Synopsys Software Integrity Group. ""By building this visibility into the application lifecycle, businesses can arm themselves with the information needed to make informed, timely decisions regarding risk resolution. Organizations leveraging any type of third-party software should rightfully assume that it contains open source. Verifying this, and staying on top of the associated risk, is as simple as obtaining an SBOM – something easily provided by a vendor taking the necessary steps to secure their software supply chain.""To learn more about the 2023 OSSRA findings, download a copy of the report, read the blog post, or register for the March 23rd webinar.About the Synopsys Software Integrity GroupSynopsys Software Integrity Group provides integrated solutions that transform the way development teams build and deliver software, accelerating innovation while addressing business risk.

CAG, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Philip Morris International Inc. PM and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Solid Economic Data Unnerves Investors: 5 Low-Beta PicksU.S. stock markets have seen northbound movement so far this year after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 2.1%, 6.2% and 12.6%, respectively. However, off late, volatility has returned on Wall Street.Several strong economic data and hotter-than-expected inflation rates of January raised concerns that the Fed's tighter monetary control and higher interest rate regime is unlikely to terminate any time soon. Market participants confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent. Volatility is likely to continue in the near term.Strong Economic Data for JanuaryThe nonfarm payrolls for January jumped to 517,000 in January from 260,000 in December. The consensus estimate was 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4% in January from 3.5% in the previous month. The consensus estimate was 3.6%.The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales unexpectedly jumped 3% in January after declining 1.1% in December. The consensus estimate was an increase of 1.7%. The ISM Services Index climbed to 55.2% in January from 49.2% In December. The consensus estimate was 50.6%. Any reading above 50% means an expansion in services activities.Industrial production was unchanged in January after falling 0.6% and 1% in November and December, respectively. Within the overall industrial production, manufacturing and mining output rose 1% and 2%, respectively. The output of utilities fell 9.9% in January due to unseasonably warm weather in January.Story continuesGood Economic Data Bad for Wall StreetStrong economic data has unnerved investors as a higher wage rate will raise aggregate demand, making inflation stubborn. The consumer price Index and the producer price Index of January were reported last week. These two key inflation measures were higher than the consensus mark, indicating that the Fed has to go a long way to tame inflation to near 2%.The fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up further following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He said that he had proposed a 50-basis point rate hike in the Fed's last meeting and such a hike could be expected in the March meeting. Bullard's sentiments were echoed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, saying that she also supports a steeper rate hike in the next meeting, which further weighed on stocks.On Feb 17, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said ""I think there's a long way to go before we reach our 2% inflation objective and I think we'll have to continue to raise the federal funds rate until we see a lot more progress on that.""Fearing a prolonged higher interest rate regime, the ICE dollar index rose 0.25% last week. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note rose 8.4 basis points last week to close at 3.827%.The Dow fell recorded three consecutive weeks of decline. This happened for the first time since September 2022. The S&amp;P 500 posted losses for two successive weeks for the first time in 2023.Stock Selection ProcessAt this stage, we have applied a broad selection criteria. First, we have selected stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care. Second, we have chosen low-beta stocks. Third, high dividend yield stocks have been handpicked. Finally, we have picked stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential.

You should consider the Goldman Sachs MarketBeta U.S. 1000 Equity ETF (GUSA), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 04/05/2022.The fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $1.24 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.11%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.96%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 26.80% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 5.91% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).Performance and RiskGUSA seeks to match the performance of the SOLACTIVE GBS US 1000 INDEX before fees and expenses. The Solactive GBS United States 1000 Index measures the performance of equity securities of large and mid-capitalization equity issuers covering approximately the largest 1,000 of the free-float market capitalization in the United States.Story continuesThe ETF has added roughly 4.78% so far. In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $31.16 and $38.91.With about 1012 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs MarketBeta U.S. 1000 Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GUSA is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $300.99 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $366.07 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, the broader technology space inherently commands significant attention. After all, the underlying enterprises form the backbone of various innovations that spark myriad conveniences and improved productivity. Still, not all entities will command the same magnitude of attention.It really comes down to a math problem. According to Investopedia, about 5,000 indexes cover the U.S. equities market. When you broaden the horizon to Europe and Asia, you’re talking about a massive library of potential opportunities. And while we’re talking about overlooked tech stocks to buy, that’s still a remarkably large number. For instance, the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite tracks more than 2,500 securities.Thus, it’s inevitable that some companies won’t attract the attention they deserve. Fortunately for you, you can exploit this dynamic for enhanced profitability potential. Below are seven overlooked tech stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPATHUiPath$15.54FISVFiserv$115.37WDCWestern Digital$41.58AMKRAmkor Technology$26.51CTSHCognizant Technology$65.48KLICKulicke and Soffa$53.54GPNGlobal PaymentsUiPath (PATH)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockA global software company, UiPath (NYSE:PATH) specializes in robotic process automation software. According to its public profile, the company’s software monitors user activity to automate repetitive front and back office tasks, including those performed using other business software such as customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning software. Although PATH gained a blistering 31% since the Jan. opener, it’s still technically undervalued as it’s down 56% in the trailing year.Further, since its public market debut in April 2021, data from Google Finance reveals that PATH dropped more than 78%. Because of the sharp losses, PATH has become one of the overlooked tech stocks. Nevertheless, those that want to wager on a potentially viable business may want to give it some consideration.Story continuesAccording to Grand View Research, the global robotic process automation market reached a valuation of $1.89 billion in 2021. From 2022 to 2030, experts project that it will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.2%. At the end of the forecasted period, the sector may see total revenue of $30.85 billion.Notably, Wall Street analysts peg PATH as a consensus moderate buy. Further, they anticipate shares rising to $18.41, implying a nearly 15% upside potential.Fiserv (FISV)A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word ""Fintech,"" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth.Source: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.comA multinational corporation, Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) provides financial technology services to clients across the financial services sector. These players include banks, thrifts, credit unions, securities broker-dealers, mortgage, insurance, leasing, and finance companies and retailers. Since the January opener, FISV gained more than 14%. As well, in the trailing year, shares gained 23% of equity value.Nevertheless, you can make the case that FISV stands among the overlooked tech stocks because of the financials. Objectively, despite its positive performance, it remains undervalued. In particular, the market prices FISV at a forward multiple of 15.73. As a discount to earnings, Fiserv ranks better than 71.24% of sector players.Also, the company benefits from operational strengths. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 12%, beating out 62.35% of competitors. And its net margin pings at 14.26%, above nearly 90% of its rivals. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg FISV as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $129, implying over 11% upside potential.Western Digital (WDC)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockHeadquartered in San Jose, California, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is a computer drive manufacturer and data storage company. Per its corporate profile, it designs, manufactures, and sells data technology products, including data storage devices, data center systems, and cloud storage services. Since the beginning of Jan., WDC popped dramatically higher to the tune of almost 36%. However, it’s still down nearly 25% in the trailing year.Still, astute investors probably won’t mind the red ink as WDC represents one of the overlooked tech stocks to buy. Primarily, the market prices WDC at 0.86 times (trailing) sales. As a discount to growth, Western Digital ranks better than 63% of the competition. Also, WDC trades hands at 1.12 times the book value. In contrast, the sector median value stands at 1.72 times.Further, Wall Street analysts appreciate the opportunity that Western Digital provides, pegging shares as a consensus moderate buy. While the average upside potential of 7% doesn’t seem like much, Mizuho’s latest upgrade targets WDC to hit $50. That would represent more than 17% growth potential.Amkor Technology (AMKR)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockA computer chip specialist, Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) is a semiconductor product packaging and test services provider. Specifically, it packages and tests integrated circuits for chip manufacturers. As a “background player” in the chipmaking space, AMKR does very well. This year, shares moved up nearly 6%. And in the trailing year, they gained over 11% of equity value.Still, despite the positive performance, arguably most folks would consider AMKR as one of the overlooked tech stocks. First, it doesn’t really pop up that frequently among investor publications. Second, it’s objectively undervalued. Currently, the market prices AMKR at a trailing multiple of 8.66, below the sector median of 18.66 times.Moreover, AMKR trades hands at 9.26 times forward earnings. As a discount to earnings, Amkor ranks better than 90.54% of the competition. Per Wall Street analysts, AMKR rates as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $35, implying 30% upside potential.Cognizant Technology (CTSH)Cognizant Technology Solutions logo on a corporate buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comBased in New Jersey, Cognizant Technology (NASDAQ:CTSH) operates as an information technology (IT) services and consulting company. According to its website, Cognizant helps companies modernize technology, reimagine processes and transform experiences so they stay ahead in a fast-changing world. So far this year, CTSH moved up over 15%. However, it presents a discount on the charts, shedding nearly 23% in the trailing year.Not only does CTSH stand among the overlooked tech stocks, but in my opinion, it could be grossly overlooked. Let’s start with the fiscal strength. Its Altman Z-Score of 6.6 reflects a very low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, Cognizant features a 7.7% three-year revenue growth rate, slightly better than the industry median. And on the bottom line, it features a net margin of 11.79%, ranked better than nearly 82% of the competition.Despite these attributes, the market prices CTSH at a forward multiple of 14.64. As a discount to earnings, Cognizant ranks above 74.61% of its peers. Per Gurufocus.com, CTSH also trades slightly under fair value based on its discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. It gets no love from analysts though so be aware of that.Kulicke and Soffa Industries (KLIC)In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.Source: ShutterstockBased in Singapore, Kulicke and Soffa Industries (NASDAQ:KLIC) is one of the overlooked tech stocks that I’ve been discussing for quite some time over the past few months. Kulicke is a leading provider of semiconductor, LED, and electronic assembly solutions serving the global automotive, consumer, communications, computing, and industrial markets. Though KLIC gained nearly 26% of equity value this year, over the past 365 days, it’s up only 1%.Previously, I believe I stated that KLIC represents one of the criminally overlooked tech stocks or something to that effect. I still stand by that statement. On the balance sheet, the company features a robust cash-to-debt ratio of nearly 17 times. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 44.2%. On the bottom line, Kulicke posted a trailing-year net margin of 25.8%, which dominates its sector.Despite the above attributes, the market prices KLIC at a trailing multiple of 10.4. As a discount to earnings, Kulicke ranks better than 70.29% of its rivals. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg KLIC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target of $61.67 implies 14% upside potential.Global Payments (GPN)Source: ShutterstockA global financial technology (fintech) company, Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) provides payment technology and services to merchants, issuers, and consumers. In the year so far, Global Payments is attempting to engineer a comeback effort. Shares gained over 17% of equity value since the Jan. opener. However, the company has work to do. In the trailing year, GPN slipped nearly 15%.Admittedly, it’s a very risky proposition among overlooked tech stocks; hence, I stuck it in last place on this list. Further, Gurufocus.com warns its users that GPN may be a possible value trap. Therefore, caution is key. That said, speculators will likely appreciate its three-year revenue growth rate of 9.7%, which beats out 73% of its rivals. Also, the company features a strong operating margin of 18.63%.Presently, the market prices GPN at a forward multiple of 11.36. As a discount to earnings, Global Payments outpaces 68.21% of its peers.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg GPN as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $139.47, implying upside potential of nearly 19%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

These fraternal twins join the brand’s long line of historical characters that feature inspiring role models from pivotal eras in American history. With their stories set in Seattle in 1999, Isabel and Nicki bring the dial-up decade to life for fans, highlighting the tech boom and society’s embrace of the Internet, as well as the ground-breaking music, fashion trends, and television entertainment of the era. Though they share the same birthday, these twin sisters are as different as glitter and grunge. Isabel is bubbly, extroverted, and loves dancing to pop music—while Nicki is thoughtful, introverted, and happiest while skateboarding, writing lyrics, and listening to the alt-rock sound that got its start in Seattle. As Isabel and Nicki discover who they are as individuals, they realize they share the same girl-power goal: to be true to themselves and learn to face their fears with confidence.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230222005364/en/American Girl announces its first-ever set of twin characters from the 1990s—Isabel and Nicki Hoffman. (Photo: Business Wire)""Given the prevalent wave of ’90s trends and pop culture nostalgia, we’re excited to celebrate like it’s 1999 with our newest historical duo Isabel and Nicki,"" says Jamie Cygielman, General Manager of American Girl. ""From the start, The American Girls Collection® has been central to our mission in helping build girls of strong character through inspiring stories and products that show them how the past is full of lessons that can be applied to the present. We know our fans will love getting to know more about the ’90s with Isabel and Nicki and discovering the girl power in all of our beloved heroines.""Story continuesTo write the stories, American Girl worked with real-life twin sisters, Julia DeVillers and Jennifer Roy. Together, they co-authored each character’s illustrated journal (included with the dolls), along with a full-length novel, Meet Isabel and Nicki, coming out this summer. ""Jennifer and I are both longtime fans of American Girl, which makes our work on this project even more thrilling,"" says DeVillers. ""One of our favorite parts was having access to American Girl’s archives, where we reviewed the brand’s ’90s-era materials—from the catalogues and books to past issues of American Girl magazine and all the fan mail that came with it. We love thinking about how those readers are grown up now yet helped to inspire Nicki and Isabel."" Along with the authors, American Girl collaborated with an advisory board of experts to ensure authenticity of the historical, geographical, and cultural details in the books.The twins’ story comes to life in a ’90s-inspired product collection that reflects the era and the girls’ unique styles and interests. The 18-inch Isabel™ doll features green eyes and medium-length blonde hair with platinum highlights and comes dressed in a purple sweater with attached pinstripe shirt, a multicolored plaid skirt, and pink platform shoes.

However, it’s child’s play compared to facing off in the stock market. That's at least the opinion of Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates.In a recent interview, Dalio has likened the stock market to poker, where “somebody's going to take money away from somebody else.” Not only that, but portfolios are also similar to casinos, where you win some and lose some.Dalio has done a lot of winning at the stock market game and although he might no longer be co-chief investment officer at the firm having left his role last October, he has kept a place on Bridgewater’s board.Meanwhile, the hedge fund has been rolling the dice on a pair of stocks, believing the odds are stacked in their favor. Wall Street's analysts evidently think so, too; according to the TipRanks database, both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s see what makes them good additions to the portfolio right now.Planet Labs PBC (PL)The first stock Bridgewater has been loading up on is Planet Labs, a company whose target is to revolutionize space imaging. That is, it was established with the aim of providing global satellite imagery and geospatial solutions. Planet Labs develops and manages the largest observation fleet of imaging satellites - more than 200 satellite cameras are in orbit - and collects data from more than 3 million images every day. The company offers improved analytics, imagery, and software for applications in agriculture, government, security, and many other fields.Planet Labs is relatively new to the stock market, having gone public at the end of 2021 via the SPAC route. In its latest quarterly report, for 3Q22, the company dialed in record revenue of $49.7 million, amounting to a 56.8% year-over-year increase and beating the Street’s call by $2.51 million. There was a beat on the bottom-line too, with adj. EPS of -$0.08 trumping the -$0.11 forecast. For Q4, the company anticipates revenue in the range between $50 million to $54 million, at the midpoint representing roughly a 40% year-over-year increase.Story continuesBridgewater must sees big potential here. During Q4, the hedge fund opened a new position in Planet Labs, with the purchase of 1,499,078 shares. These are now worth about $7 million.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives is also a fan and beyond providing imagery, thinks additional value lies elsewhere.“Management is looking to position the company to also provide data and effectively be a back-end supplier for companies needing satellite imaging data,” the 5-star analyst explained. “With this business model, companies can effectively partner with Planet or even launch on top of Planet’s data as an individual entity, creating a massive scaling opportunity for the name as Planet owns the data. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity for Planet to capitalize on this massive addressable market as the need for precise satellite imaging accelerates.”To this end, Ives rates PL an Outperform (i.e. Buy), alongside an $8 price target, suggesting shares will climb ~71% higher in the year ahead. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)What does the rest of the Street have to say? 4 Buys and 1 Hold have been issued over the past three months. Therefore, PL gets a Strong Buy consensus rating. Based on the $8.40 average price target, shares could rise ~79% in the next year. (See PL stock forecast)Schlumberger Limited (SLB)The next stock we're looking at is Schlumberger, a big player in oilfield services. In fact, it is the biggest offshore drilling company in the world, providing oilfield equipment and services for the global oil &amp; gas industry. Located in over 120 countries, Schlumberger's services include data processing, oil well testing, site appraisal, drilling and lifting operations. Additionally, the company offers management and consulting services.Schlumberger reported its financial results for 4Q22 in January, and the results were impressive. Revenue grew by 26.5% year-over-year to $7.9 billion, while beating the Street’s call by $110 million. Adj. EPS of $0.71 was up by 76% from the same period a year ago and also fared better than the $0.68 anticipated by the analysts. Q4 cash flow from operations reached $1.6 billion while the company generated roughly $900 million in free cash flow.Of course, energy stocks were of the few to benefit during last year’s bear and so did Schlumberger, gaining 78% over the course of the year. Bridgewater evidently thinks there’s more room to run. In Q4, the hedge fund bought 272,080 shares, increasing the stake by 74%. In total, the fund now holds 644,781 SLB shares, currently worth more than $33.7 million.Also painting an upbeat picture is Barclays analyst David Anderson, who considers SLB a 'Top Pick.'“With another impressive quarter, SLB once again presented a compelling investment case to investors – not only for its own stock, but for the entire Energy Services sector. By every measure, 2022 was one of SLB’s finest years in a decade, but with the cycle entering a new growth phase, visibility on growth and margin expansion now extends beyond 2025 (potentially well beyond,"" Anderson noted.""At this point,"" the analyst added, ""it’s hard to find fault in either the story or the outlook, especially with the Middle East and offshore cycles playing into SLB’s strengths. And with the only real bear case for SLB (other than being well owned) being valuation, the increased visibility on the duration of the cycle provides another leg of upside potential to the stock.”In line with this view of SLB's strengths, Anderson rates the stock as Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $74 price target implying a 12-month upside of ~41%. (To watch Anderson’s track record, click here)Most on the Street concur; barring one skeptic, all 11 other recent analyst reviews are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. At $67.45, the average target implies investors will be sitting on returns of ~29% a year from now. As a bonus, the company pays regular dividends that currently yield 1.87%.

99,03e4855e-f3b4-324a-8e2f-46c589a2244a,HOLX,2023-02-23,5 Top Stocks Likely to Come Up With Earnings Beat,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stocks-likely-come-113711897.html,1677152231,STORY,['HOLX'],"[It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality in nature.Ulta Beauty ULTA, Hologic HOLX, Fortinet FTNT, Splunk SPLK and ServiceNow NOW are some of the stocks that can beat earnings estimates in the upcoming reporting season.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise, though apparently looks good, doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project the earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to eight.Here are five out of the eight stocks:Ulta Beauty ULTA: The company offers a wide range of products, including cosmetics, fragrance, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of ULTA for the past four quarters is 26.18%.Hologic HOLX: Zacks Rank #1 Hologic develops, manufactures and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products, which cater to the healthcare needs of women.The average earnings surprise of HOLX for the past four quarters is 30.60%.Fortinet FTNT: The Zacks Rank #2 company is a provider of network security appliances and Unified Threat Management network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide.The average earnings surprise of FTNT for the past four quarters is 15.78%.Splunk SPLK: The Zacks Rank #2 company provides software solutions that enable enterprises to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data.The average earnings surprise of SPLK for the past four quarters is 222.03%.ServiceNow NOW: This Zacks Rank #2 company provides cloud computing services that automate digital workflows to accelerate enterprise IT operations.The average earnings surprise of NOW for the past four quarters is 6.91%.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

The figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8%.Segment in DetailCharles River’s fourth-quarter total Research Models and Services (RMS) revenues of $196.1 million were up 18.4% year over year (up 10.8% organically). Organic revenue growth was driven by robust demand for research model services, particularly the Insourcing Solutions (IS) business, as well as higher revenue for small research models in North America and China.Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) revenues of $691.7 million rose 29.5% (up 26.5% organically).

Quote Manufacturing Solutions revenues totaled $212.1 million, up 3.3% year over year (up 5.3% organically). Organic revenue growth was fueled by robust demand in the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses, partially offset by a revenue decline in the CDMO business.Story continuesMarginsThe gross profit in the reported quarter was $398.8 million, up 14.9% from the prior-year quarter. However, the gross margin of 36% contracted 209 basis points (bps) year over year on a 25.6% rise in the total costs of the company.Meanwhile, selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 38.5% to $199.6 million.Adjusted operating income totaled $199.2 million, reflecting a 1.9% drop from the prior-year quarter.

Organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 4.5-7.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $4.15 billion, indicating a 5.9% rise from 2022.Adjusted EPS for 2023 is expected in the range of $9.70-$10.90. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $11.37.Our TakeCharles River exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The results highlighted a more than 15% organic revenue growth, driven by strength across the DSA and Research Models and Services RMS business segments. The company registered robust demand in the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses.On the flip side, the contraction of both margins and escalating costs are concerning. Headwinds associated with foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and interest expense due to a rising interest rate environment increase concerns.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCharles River currently carries Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

The figure increased 45% year over year(up 42% excluding the PreventionGenetics acquisition).The upside was driven by impressive contributions from PreventionGenetics and Cologuard volume growth.

The company expects Precision Oncology revenues in the range of $600-$620 million. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be $5 million.Our TakeExact Sciences exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The decline in quarterly loss compared to the year-ago period was encouraging. Robust revenues from the Screening and Precision Oncology segments contributed to the third-quarter top line. The company noted that more than 302,000 healthcare providers ordered Cologuard from its launch till the end of September. The growing uptake of the company’s Oncotype DX Breast and therapy selection products are major advantages.However, the decline in COVID-19 sales hampered top-line growth. The company incurred an operating loss in the quarter under review, raising apprehension. Contraction in gross margin on escalating costs does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksExact Sciences currently carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

The metric exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%.The fourth-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $215 million.In the fourth quarter, volume was driven by continued strong demand for Digestive Health products and improvements in Interventional Pain solutions.

Excluding the OrthogenRx buyout and the negative impact of currency, the business recorded a year-over-year sales uptick of 2.6%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $1.64.Per Avanos, excluding the expected impact of the product portfolio rationalization under the transformation plan, the company anticipates organic growth to be low single-digit.Our TakeAvanos exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The year-over-year improvement in the overall top and bottom lines was impressive. The strength exhibited by Avanos’ core Pain Management and Chronic Care segments was encouraging. The low single-digit growth in Acute Pain and mid-single-digit growth in Interventional Pain solutions are promising.The continued strong demand for Avanos’ products and solutions, as evidenced by the double-digit growth in Game Ready and COOLIEF sales during the quarter, also augur well. Strength in Digestive Health, with robust growth in NeoMed (fueled by strong execution of customer conversions to Avanos’ ENFit technology), was impressive. The expansion of both margins bodes well.Yet, the year-over-year decline in the Respiratory health business is disappointing. The continued supply headwinds, particularly within Avanos’ surgical pain category, and management’s expectations that these headwinds would remain a factor throughout the first part of 2023 raise our apprehension. Other issues like hospital staff shortages that have kept elective procedure levels at a lower level and inflation impacting Avanos’ business also raise our apprehension.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAvanos currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

(NASDAQ:INTU) in its 2022 yearly investor letter:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow. ..” (Click here to read the full text)12.

(NASDAQ:TMUS) and held collective stakes worth $3.71 billion in the company. Of those, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in the company and has disclosed a position worth $733.8 million.11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is ranked eleventh among the most promising QQQ stocks according to hedge funds. At the end of Q4 2022, 97 hedge funds held stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The total value of these stakes amounted to $5.70 billion. This is compared to 89 positions in the preceding quarter with stakes worth $4.99 billion.

(NASDAQ:AMD) and has a position worth $424.7 million.Here is what L1 Capital International had to say about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The share price of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was weak during the quarter and weakened further in early October when the pre-announced revenue was significantly below prior guidance, reflecting an acute slowdown in the PC market. Data centre related revenue grew strongly, albeit below our expectations, while gaming and embedded revenue was in line with our base case.Geopolitical risks have increased for the semiconductor sector, with the U.S. Government announcing restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. Despite near term headwinds, AMD is well positioned for the medium term, with a technology lead over Intel in servers for data centres and rapidly gaining share in the PC/notebook sectors. Its gaming and embedded applications continue to grow strongly. AMD is a very capital light business, with manufacturing outsourced. After expending nearly $5b on research and development, AMD generates around $5b of free cashflow. With a net cash balance sheet, we expect management will accelerate buyback activity at a share price well below fair value.The share price of our more cyclical businesses, in particularly the building products companies which have exposure to the U.S. residential, repair and renovation and infrastructure sectors, were broadly flat for the quarter. Rapidly escalating mortgage rates and rapidly reducing affordability will have a pronounced negative effect on near term new residential construction activity. We believe these cyclical pressures are well understood and are more than reflected in current share prices. Overall, we strongly believe share prices are overly reflecting near-term challenges and our portfolio of companies are now meaningfully undervalued.”10. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Wall Street sees upside to Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). On February 15, UBS analyst Karl Keirstead raised his price target on Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) and has a position worth $709.8 million in the company.Here is what Andvari Associates had to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of several software companies we own. Its suite of creative products (Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat, Lightroom, etc.) are the industry standard for creative professionals. Adobe also has a suite of customer experience products that help other businesses sell more easily to consumers. All of Adobe’s products have high switching costs and sold on a subscription basis.Adobe’s business qualities enable extremely high margins and predictable, recurring revenues. The company had revenues of $17.6 billion in its last fiscal year with operating margins in the mid-30s. The company has also grown revenues at double-digit rates every year since 2015. Despite a good record of investing in its businesses, it still has an excess of cash on its balance sheet. As such, Adobe has returned cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Since 2015 the company has returned a total of $24.5 billion.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106Hedge funds are piling into NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is placed ninth on our list of the most promising QQQ stocks according to hedge funds.Here is what O’keefe Stevens Advisory had to say about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The market and our portfolios had a challenging year as interest rates rose, and deteriorating fundamentals cut our largest position, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in half. Since our initial purchase in 2013, NVDA has seen its stock decline 50% one other time, back in 2018. The best-performing businesses and stocks do not go up and to the right. Mr. Market gets moody, and even one of the highest quality companies in the world is not immune. Drawdowns of this magnitude are challenging to stomach, even though the stock is up 50x in less than ten years. While we consider ourselves old school value investors, we continue to hold this fantastic company even though, optically, it does not appear cheap. Our confidence in Jensen remains, and while gaming is no longer in hyper-growth mode, the Data Center segment continues to grow. AI, Automotive, and other small but rapidly growing industries are the next leg of the story. Chris Mayer discusses the position in greater detail with commentary from our CIO, Peter O’Keefe.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) suffered with the slowdown in e-commerce, yet still will have outgrown e-commerce when we see final 2022 numbers. Much like Amazon, PayPal invested far too aggressively on the expectation of sustained elevated growth rates in e-commerce and unfortunately, unlike with Amazon, PayPal’s investment was on ancillary product excursions from which the company is already retrenching. The good news is that with this retrenchment, the company should once again return to its recipe of healthy top line growth and incremental margin leverage, but rather than grow back into their old margin structure they will have to cost-cut their way there.”7. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 117Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is ranked seventh among the most promising QQQ stocks according to hedge funds.

Q3 results saw a return to subscriber growth, with the firm adding 2.4m and finishing at an all time high 223m subscribers. Netflix also debuted its much-anticipated advertising tier in November, pricing it at a 30% discount in the US. While it is still very early days, we think by 2028 Netflix’s ad-supported tier will have tens of millions of subscribers and generate $10+ billion in revenue at high margins. We expect earnings to exceed $30 per share by then, roughly triple what the company earns today.”6. Activision Blizzard, Inc.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system.

This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.CMLS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.30, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 30.19.

NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.57.Another notable valuation metric for CMLS is its P/B ratio of 0.28. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

High oil prices have been the major catalyst pushing energy stocks higher, and there are several factors keeping prices elevated. Inflation, and the increased cost of labor and goods.The Russian - Ukrainian war has raised uncertainty in the European energy market and created trade bans with Russia thus tightening oil supply.Structural shortages of oil production due to underinvestment in energy infrastructure.There are several oil and gas stocks with upward trending earnings revisions giving them high Zacks Ranks scores. Furthermore, according to the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas – Refining and Marketing is in the top 5% (12 out of 251) of industries.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero EnergyValero Energy VLO is a deeply diversified oil refinery company with 15 plants across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean and capacity to refine 3.2 million barrels a day. The majority of VLO’s refinery plants are located in the Gulf Coast with easy access to export facilities, boosting margins. Valero recently reported strong fourth-quarter results with a 13% upside surprise on EPS.VLO has been a top performing stock over the past year, trouncing the returns of the broad market and more than doubling returns of its respective sector. Even after the price of oil peaked back in March 2022, VLO stock is still pushing near its all-time highs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBecause of its strong performance and prospects VLO currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. In the table below, you can estimates across time frames dipped significantly between 90 and 30 days ago. But the estimates have been revised dramatically higher over the last 30 days.Current quarter earnings estimates are projected to jump nearly 200% YoY to $6.90 per share.VLO also has encouraging Zacks Style Scores, earning an A for Value, B for Growth, and A for Momentum.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero Energy currently trades at a one-year forward P/E of 6x, well below its 10-year median of 10x, and in line with the industry's average. Additionally, VLO offers a dividend yield of 3.1%. We can see that although the path of dividend increases has been volatile, it has been increasing over the last two decades.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon PetroleumMarathon Petroleum MPC, is a U.S. based integrated, downstream energy company. MPC operates through two segments, Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation. Refining and Marketing operates 16 refineries with a crude processing capacity of 3 million barrels per day. In 2022 the refining business recorded $16.5 billion in profits. Pipeline transportation, operating as a partnership with Andeavor Logistics transports oil products and manages logistics. It earned $4.5 billion in profits in 2022.Additionally, in 2021, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway retail gasoline business for $21 billion to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; I Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.MPC currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating that earnings expectations are being revised higher. In the chart below we can see that both 2023 and 2024 expectations are clearly trending higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike VLO, MPS has seen the majority of positive revisions happen over the last 30 days. All projections have been revised significantly higher, besides next quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon Petroleum is currently trading at 7x one-year forward P/E, which is below its 5-year median of 9x, and just above the industry average 6x.

Refining is the primary contributor to the top line, and PSX operates 13 refineries across the U.S. and Europe. Midstream businesses, which focus on transportation and storage of petroleum have been flourishing of late. Considering the lack of energy infrastructure that has taken place over the last decade, many investors have become keen on the sector.PSX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Additionally, the stock earns an A grade across Zacks Style Scores Value, Growth and Momentum. Current quarter sales estimates are projecting a YoY decrease of -4.5% to $35 billion, but earnings are still expected to grow. Current quarter EPS of $3.86 per share would mark a 193% YoY increase.PSX also boasts a very reasonable valuation. The stock is currently trading at a one-year forward P/E of 7x, below its 10-year median of 12x, and just above the industry average of 6x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPSX is also a great dividend stock with a current yield of 4.2%, and a long history of raising dividend payments.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionWe covered what is pushing oil prices higher, but whether these issues will persist is of course unknown. For the time being all these factors are still at play though. A major sell-off in oil prices, or a slowdown in economic output would be a thorn in the bullish energy thesis.Oil and gas stocks have made an epic comeback since the 2020 pandemic era. Oil futures at one point during the depths of Covid traded -$16. It was also a popular narrative that the world would soon be running off entirely alternative energy sources and driving electric cars. While that may be true eventually, oil, gas and other fossil fuels are still the primary sources of energy for the world.Furthermore, as seen in this report, oil and gas companies make for great stocks, with strong business models, reasonable valuations, and generous dividends. Because of these traits, energy stocks make for a great addition to any investor’s portfolio. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TJX)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-tjx-companies-110020519.html,1677150020,STORY,['TJX'],"[Key InsightsTJX Companies' estimated fair value is US$80.40 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$77.46 suggests TJX Companies is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$86.00 analyst price target for TJX is 7.0% more than our estimate of fair valueIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.11bUS$2.92bUS$3.77bUS$4.52bUS$5.46bUS$6.16bUS$6.75bUS$7.24bUS$7.65bUS$8.01bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 12.75%Est @ 9.55%Est @ 7.31%Est @ 5.73%Est @ 4.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$1.9kUS$2.5kUS$3.0kUS$3.3kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$33bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$132bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$132b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$60bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$93b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$77.5, the company appears about fair value at a 3.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TJX Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.043. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TJX CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Pharmaceutical Stocks Now. The pharmaceutical industry was the center of attention in 2020 and 2021 after the deadly coronavirus pandemic ravaged the globe and disrupted the way of living. As countries played hide and seek with lockdowns, it was left to pharmaceuticals to come up with a cure for a disease that in the early stages of the pandemic had flooded hospitals and overwhelmed graveyards.Fast forward to 2023 and the pandemic is a thing of the past. Vaccines such as those from Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are among some of the most advanced products in the world since they are capable of influencing cell function in the human body, making them perfect for developing long term immunity against the virus. The technology also reaped billions in dividends for the companies, particularly Moderna whose shares are up by a massive 826% over the past five years as the company which was a relatively unknown firm was transformed into a global household name.These days, the pharmaceutical industry is focusing on rising technologies such as artificial intelligence to crack the puzzle to defeat diseases such as cancer and thalassemia. Estimates made by the healthcare giant Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (OTCMKTS:BAYZF) show that the world's population is aging at a remarkable rate, with individuals aged 65 and above set to double to 1.5 billion by 2050. At the same time, the growth in noncommunicable and serious diseases, such as heart problems or cancer, is expected to grow at an equally fast rate, with China alone seeing such diseases to account for 80% of all deaths of people aged 60 or higher by 2030. Bayer goes on to estimate a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for the pharmaceutical industry, and keeping the aforementioned factors in mind, it believes that the sector can grow as fast as by 6% through 2025.Story continuesAnother research report, this time from Facts and Factors, has similar estimates for the market. It lays down a 5.7% CAGR for the industry from 2022 to 2028 and believes that the sector, which was worth $1.4 billion last year, will be worth $2 billion by the end of the forecast period. Like Bayer, Facts and Factors also believes that diseases such as cancer and diabetes will fuel this growth and that growth in the population of elderly people will result in a higher demand for pharmaceutical products. It adds that companies are using machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing to enhance their manufacturing processes, and states that North America was the largest pharmaceutical market in 2021.Today's piece will look at some well performing pharmaceutical firms, with the top picks being Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).Most Profitable Pharmaceutical Stocks NowPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur Methodology We sifted through the pharmaceutical industry to pick the biggest firms in terms of both market capitalization and revenue.

121,ba849552-18ba-3ea5-ab0e-2bffcdd6e9ff,AMGN,2023-02-23,AMGEN ANNOUNCES CARDIOVASCULAR STUDY TO EVALUATE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LIPOPROTEIN(a) AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN AFRICAN AMERICANS,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-announces-cardiovascular-study-evaluate-140000255.html,1677074400,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Unique Community-Based Partnership With the Association of Black Cardiologists and Morehouse School of Medicine to Identify Study Sites and ParticipantsObservational Study to Better Understand Associations Between Lp(a) Levels and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) in an Underrepresented Patient PopulationTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Feb. 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced the African American Heart Study, in collaboration with the Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC) and the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), which will measure the association between Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in 5,000 African American individuals across the United States. ASCVD is defined as the buildup of cholesterol plaque in arteries and includes events such as heart attack and stroke.""The African American Heart Study is a unique collaborative study including community outreach in partnership with trusted organizations to help improve our understanding of the disproportionate higher incidence of Lp(a) and cardiovascular disease progression in African Americans and hopefully provide insights of ways to address barriers in clinical trial access,"" said Ponda Motsepe-Ditshego, M.D., vice president, global medical and head of Amgen's Representation in Clinical Research team. ""At Amgen, our mission is to serve patients, and important to that mission is expanding clinical trial access and diverse representation in the community setting to provide a full picture of how a disease impacts certain groups.""Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of all Americans, and the cardiovascular risk for African Americans is even higher. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, African Americans are 30% more likely to die from heart disease than non-Hispanic whites.1-2Lp(a) is a presumed independent risk factor for heart disease; levels are genetically determined and are known to differ by race and ethnicity.3-6 African American individuals show a higher average Lp(a) concentration than white populations, but Lp(a) research to date has primarily been conducted in individuals of European descent.7 This leaves the association between Lp(a) levels and incident ASCVD in persons of African American descent uncertain and important to investigate further to understand drivers of cardiovascular risk in African Americans. Amgen has initiated the African American Heart Study to bridge this gap.  Story continues""People of all races and ethnicities can have high levels of Lp(a), but it appears to be more common in African Americans. I am excited about the African American Heart Study because we have the opportunity to study up to 5,000 self-identified African Americans, who have been so often underrepresented in studies, in order to gain a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of Lp(a) and to determine if African American patients are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease,"" said Elizabeth Ofili, M.D., M.P.H., FACC, professor of medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine and principal investigator of the study. ""The results of this study will potentially provide insights that will help determine which types of patients would benefit most from future therapy.""This prospective case-control study design will enroll 2,500 self-identified African Americans with ASCVD and 2,500 self-identified African Americans without ASCVD from cardiology and primary care practices across the United States. Enrollment is voluntary. ABC and MSM will conduct community outreach, as well as identify sites through the Health 360x Clinical Trial Network and Registry. The Health 360x Network practice sites are trusted providers, crucial to the success of the African American Heart Study. The Health 360x Clinical Trial Network and Registry is funded by the National Institutes of Health to support clinical trials in community-based practices.9Amgen's subsidiary, deCODE genetics, based in Iceland, with its world-class human genetics capabilities, will sequence and analyze DNA, RNA, and protein markers from participants' blood samples. With three years of follow-up planned, the broad omics data analyzed by deCODE will help Amgen broaden the understanding of ASCVD and other diseases that disproportionately affect African Americans. The learnings may also inform future clinical trials and drug development.""Increasing the diversity in our clinical trials is essential to achieving our ambition of serving all patients. This requires us to think differently than we have in the past about how we design and conduct our trials,"" said Rob Lenz, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, Global Development at Amgen. ""To do that, we are educating the community on why this is critical and building trusted relationships with our partners. We also are training external investigators and building new capabilities that will help provide them with the right infrastructures in communities of underserved patient populations to make projects like the African American Heart Study possible.""The African American Heart Study is emblematic of Amgen's unwavering commitment to diversity in clinical trials. In 2020, Amgen launched its Representation in Clinical Research team to accelerate its work in promoting diversity in clinical trials and is focused on improving clinical trial diversity and proportional representation by addressing the systemic issues that deter people from participating in research, especially those who have been historically excluded due to race, ethnicity, sex, age, and other factors.About the African American Heart StudyThe main objective of the study is to determine associations between Lp(a) levels, sequence variants, clinical factors and cardiovascular outcomes in African Americans. Participants will be followed for at least three years leveraging real-world evidence from electronic health records.About Lp(a)Lp(a) is genetically determined and presumed to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). 4-6 Although an agreed upon threshold for elevated Lp(a) is not firmly established, it has been estimated that approximately 20% of adults have Lp(a) &gt;125 nmol/L (or approximately 50 mg/dL).3-6 Evidence has emerged from pathophysiological, epidemiologic, and genetic studies on the potential role of elevated Lp(a) in contributing to myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.3-8About Amgen Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities.

Measure and Indicated copper resources increased slightly to 17.9 billion pounds from 17.8 billion pounds, primarily due to increased equity at Conga and Yanacocha. Inferred copper resources remained flat at 8.6 billion pounds as compared to the prior year.Silver reserves increased to 593 million ounces from 568 million ounces in the prior year, primarily due to increased equity at Yanacocha. Measured and Indicated silver resources also increased to 500 million ounces from 422 million ounces in the prior year, primarily due to increased equity at Yanacocha and Conga. Inferred silver resources decreased to 152 million ounces from 163 million ounces in the prior year, primarily due to the divestiture of Agua Rica and resource conversion at Cerro Negro.Lead reserves decreased to 2.3 billion pounds from 2.6 billion pounds in the prior year, and zinc reserves also decreased to 5.5 billion pounds from 6.3 billion pounds. These decreases were primarily due to depletion at Peñasquito. Measured and Indicated lead resources increased to 1.6 billion pounds from 1.2 billion pounds, while Inferred lead resources decreased to 440 million pounds from 480 million pounds in the prior year. Measured and Indicated zinc resources increased to 3.7 billion pounds from 2.7 billion pounds and Inferred zinc resources decreased to 1.0 billion pounds from 1.1 billion pounds in the prior year. The increases in Measured and Indicated lead and zinc resources were primarily due to positive revision at Peñasquito. The decreases in Inferred lead and zinc resources were primarily due to negative revisions and conversion at Peñasquito.EXPLORATION OUTLOOKNewmont’s attributable exploration expenditure for managed operations is expected to be approximately $200 million in 2023 with 80 percent of total exploration investment dedicated to near-mine expansion programs and the remaining 20 percent allocated to the advancement of greenfield projects.Additionally, Newmont’s share of exploration investment for its non-managed joint ventures will total approximately $25 million.Geographically, the Company expects to invest approximately 32 percent in North America, 30 percent in South America, 18 percent in Africa and the remainder in Australia and other locations.________________________________________________1 North America includes 38.5 percent interest in Nevada Gold Mines; South America includes Newmont's 40 percent interest in Pueblo Viejo.2 Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs) are calculated using 2022 Mineral Reserve pricing for Gold ($1,400/oz.), Copper ($3.50/lb.), Silver ($20.00/oz.), Lead ($1.00/lb.), and Zinc ($1.20/lb.) and Resource pricing for Gold ($1,600/oz.), Copper ($4.00/lb.), Silver ($23.00/oz.), Lead ($1.20/lb.), and Zinc ($1.45/lb.) and metallurgical recoveries for each metal on a site by site basis, as metal * [(metal price * metal recovery) / (gold price * gold recovery)].3 In 2022, the Company increased its ownership interest in Yanacocha to 100% by acquiring Buenaventura’s 43.65% and Sumitomo's 5% noncontrolling interest, respectively.4 In November 2022, Newmont sold its 18.75% ownership in Agua Rica.GOLD RESERVE SENSITIVITYA $100 increase in gold price would result in an approximate three percent increase in gold reserves while a $100 decrease in gold price would result in an approximate seven percent decrease in gold reserves. These sensitivities assume an oil price of $85 per barrel (WTI), Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.75 and Canadian dollar exchange rate of $0.80. These sensitivities assume all other inputs remain equal, including all cost and capital assumptions, which may impact the reality of these approximate estimates.KEY RESERVE AND RESOURCE ASSUMPTIONS At December 31,  2022 2021Gold Reserves ($/oz)$1,400$1,200Gold Resources ($/oz)$1,600$1,400Copper Reserves ($/lb)$3.50$2.75Copper Resources ($/lb)$4.00$3.25Silver Reserves ($/oz)$20.00$20.00Silver Resources ($/oz)$23.00$23.00Lead Reserves ($/lb)$1.00$0.90Lead Resources ($/lb)$1.20$1.10Zinc Reserves ($/lb)$1.20$1.15Zinc Resources ($/lb)$1.45$1.40Australian Dollar (A$:US$)$0.75$0.75Canadian Dollar (C$:US$)$0.80$0.77West Texas Intermediate ($/bbl)$85$60For additional details on Newmont’s reported gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, please refer to the tables at the end of this release.RESERVE AND RESOURCE TABLESProven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. The reference point for mineral reserves is the point of delivery to the process plant. Metal price assumptions, adjusted for our exchange rate assumption, are based on considering such factors as market forecasts, industry consensus and management estimates. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralization considered economic to process, varies between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or molybdenum extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available. Reserve estimates may have non-material differences in comparison to our joint venture partners due to differences in classification and rounding methodology.The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum will be realized. Ounces of gold or silver or pounds of copper, lead, zinc or molybdenum included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing higher cost reserves uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.The measured, indicated, and inferred resource figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation and are exclusive of reserves. A ""mineral resource"" is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade, or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. The reference point for mineral resources is in situ. Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories. Ounces of gold and silver or pounds of copper, zinc, lead, and molybdenum included in the measured, indicated and inferred resources are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. The terms ""measured resource,"" ""indicated resource,"" and ""inferred resource"" mean that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of geological evidence and sampling that is considered to be comprehensive, adequate, or limited, respectively. Market fluctuations in the price of gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and molybdenum, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could change future estimates of resources.We publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2023, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, to future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2023.Please refer to the reserves and resources cautionary statement at the end of the release.Gold Reserves (1)December 31, 2022December 31, 2021    Proven Reserves Probable Reserves Proven and Probable Reserves  Proven and Probable ReservesDeposits/Districts Newmont Share Tonnage (2)(000 tonnes)Grade(g/tonne)Ounces (3)(000) Tonnage (2)(000 tonnes)Grade(g/tonne)Ounces (3)(000) Tonnage (2)(000 tonnes)Grade(g/tonne)Ounces (3)(000) Metallurgical Recovery (3)Tonnage (2)(000 tonnes)Grade(g/tonne)Ounces (3)(000)North America                   CC&amp;V Open Pits 100% 49,3000.39620 12,0000.31120 61,4000.37740 57%86,1000.431,180CC&amp;V Leach Pads (4)(5) 100% ——— 32,6000.78820 32,6000.78820 56%31,2000.81810Total CC&amp;V, Colorado   49,3000.39620 44,6000.66940 94,0000.521,560 56%117,3000.531,990Musselwhite, Canada (6) 100% 3,4005.48590 7,0005.891,320 10,4005.761,920 96%9,5005.771,770Porcupine Underground (7) 100% 1,8008.50500 7008.47190 2,5008.49690 92%3,2007.46770Porcupine Open Pit (8) 100% 2,6001.60130 31,9001.441,480 34,5001.461,610 93%39,6001.441,830Total Porcupine, Canada   4,4004.44630 32,6001.591,670 37,0001.932,300 93%42,8001.892,600Éléonore, Canada (9) 100% 1,9005.11310 7,4005.251,260 9,4005.221,570 92%11,2005.051,820Peñasquito, Mexico (10)(17) 100% 104,5000.581,960 212,0000.513,450 316,5000.535,410 69%362,0000.546,330TOTAL NORTH AMERICA   163,5000.784,110 303,7000.898,640 467,2000.8512,750 79%542,8000.8314,510South America                   Yanacocha Open Pits (11) 100% 27,5000.71630 119,0000.722,750 146,5000.723,380 57%84,7000.681,840Yanacocha Underground (12) 100% ——— 12,3006.062,400 12,3006.062,400 97%7,0006.201,390Total Yanacocha, Peru (13)   27,5000.71630 131,3001.225,140 158,8001.135,780 73%91,7001.103,230Merian, Suriname (14) 75% 31,0001.161,150 73,8001.162,750 104,8001.163,900 93%101,6001.224,000Cerro Negro, Argentina (15) 100% 1,6009.46500 7,80010.132,530 9,40010.023,030 95%9,0008.892,560Pueblo Viejo Open Pits 40% 23,5002.291,730 55,0002.153,800 78,5002.195,530 90%13,2002.28970Pueblo Viejo Stockpiles (16) 40% ——— 38,2002.172,670 38,2002.172,670 90%37,4002.202,640Total Pueblo Viejo, Dominican Republic (17)(18)   23,5002.291,730 93,1002.166,470 116,6002.198,200 90%50,6002.223,610NuevaUnión, Chile (19)(28) 50% ——— 341,1000.475,110 341,1000.475,110 66%341,1000.475,110Norte Abierto, Chile (20)(28) 50% ——— 598,8000.6011,620 598,8000.6011,620 74%598,8000.6011,620TOTAL SOUTH AMERICA   83,7001.494,010 1,245,8000.8433,630 1,329,5000.8837,640 80%1,192,8000.7930,130Australia                   Boddington Open Pit 100% 237,4000.685,190 209,3000.644,300 446,7000.669,490 85%476,5000.6810,440Boddington Stockpiles (16) 100% 2,0000.7150 76,2000.431,040 78,3000.431,090 80%81,8000.441,150Total Boddington, Western Australia (17)(21)   239,4000.685,240 285,5000.585,350 524,9000.6310,580 84%558,3000.6511,590Tanami, Northern Territory (22) 100% 11,3005.051,840 21,6005.493,820 33,0005.345,660 98%34,8005.155,780TOTAL AUSTRALIA   250,8000.887,080 307,1000.939,160 557,9000.9116,240 89%593,1000.9117,370Africa                   Ahafo South Open Pits (23) ]"

Significant non-cash accounting charges were adjusted out of the Company's earnings, compared to GAAP Net Loss from Continuing Operations of $(1.5) billion, primarily related to impairment charges of $1.3 billion and reclamation charges of $700 million recorded at year end in conjunction with the Company's annual review.$511 million impairment of long-lived assets at CC&amp;V; primarily due to the decision to transition to a leach-only operation, resulting in lower future production and reduced future cash flows from the site$459 million impairment of the full goodwill balance at Cerro Negro; primarily due to lower discounted cash flows from an increase in the country specific discount rate, reflective of current macroeconomic risk and uncertainty in Argentina$341 million impairment of the full goodwill balance at Porcupine; primarily due to lower discounted cash flows from higher costs driven by inflationary pressures and the expansion of the active tailings storage facility, ensuring compliance with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM)$529 million reclamation adjustment at Yanacocha; primarily due to updated capital costs for construction of the two water treatment plants due to updated design considerations, recent inflation and supply chain disruption impacts on the estimated construction costs and higher post-closure management costs$91 million reclamation adjustment at Porcupine; primarily due to higher water management and other closure costs due to inflationary pressuresThe site-specific goodwill amounts originated from the Goldcorp purchase price allocation four years ago, which was based on best estimates of each site's value and country-risk assumptions at that time. Non-cash accounting charges have been adjusted out of the Company's earnings metrics for the fourth quarter and full year.FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2022 FINANCIAL AND PRODUCTION SUMMARYAttributable gold production1 for the year remained flat at 5,956 thousand ounces compared to the prior year.Attributable gold production for the fourth quarter remained flat at 1,630 thousand ounces compared to the prior year quarter.Gold CAS totaled $5.4 billion for the year. Gold CAS per ounce2 increased 19 percent to $933 per ounce compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher direct operating costs as a result of inflationary pressures, driven by higher labor costs and higher input commodity prices, notably fuel and energy costs. In addition, costs were impacted by inventory write-downs at Nevada Gold Mines, Yanacocha, CC&amp;V and Akyem, lower by-product credits, the Peñasquito Profit-Sharing Agreement entered into in 2022 and lower gold sales volumes.Gold CAS increased 17 percent to $1.5 billion from the prior year quarter. Gold CAS per ounce increased 17 percent to $940 per ounce compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher direct operating costs as a result of inflationary pressures and higher third party royalties.Gold AISC per ounce3 increased 14 percent to $1,211 per ounce compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher CAS per ounce and higher sustaining capital spend.Gold AISC per ounce increased 15 percent to $1,215 per ounce compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher CAS per ounce and higher sustaining capital spend.Attributable GEO production from other metals for the year remained largely flat at 1,275 thousand ounces compared to the prior year.Attributable GEO production from other metals for the quarter decreased 7 percent to 296 thousand ounces from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower co-product grades mined at Peñasquito, partially offset by higher copper grade mined at Boddington.CAS from other metals totaled $1.0 billion for the year. CAS per GEO2 increased 28 percent to $819 per ounce from the prior year, primarily due to higher direct operating costs as a result of inflationary pressures, as well as the Peñasquito Profit-Sharing Agreement entered into in 2022.CAS from other metals totaled $267 million for the quarter. CAS per GEO increased 16 percent to $857 per ounce from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher direct operating costs as a result of inflationary pressures and higher allocation of costs to co-product metals, partially offset by favorable inventory changes.AISC per GEO3 for the year increased 24 percent to $1,114 per ounce from the prior year primarily due to higher CAS from other metals, higher treatment and refining costs, and higher sustaining capital spend.AISC per GEO for the quarter increased 16 percent to $1,166 per ounce from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher CAS from other metals, higher treatment and refining costs, and higher sustaining capital spend.Average realized gold price for the year increased $4 per ounce to $1,792 per ounce compared to the prior year, including $1,800 per ounce of gross price received and $8 per ounce reductions for treatment and refining charges.Average realized gold price for the quarter decreased $40 per ounce to $1,758 per ounce compared to the prior year quarter, including $1,751 per ounce of gross price received, the favorable impact of $12 per ounce mark-to-market on provisionally-priced sales and $5 per ounce reductions for treatment and refining charges.Revenue for the year remained largely flat at $11.9 billion compared to the prior year.Revenue for the quarter decreased 6 percent to $3.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower realized gold prices.Net loss from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders for the year was $(0.5) billion or $(0.58) per diluted share, a decrease of $1.6 billion from the prior year primarily due to the impairment of goodwill at Cerro Negro of $459 million and Porcupine of $341 million, impairment of long-lived assets at CC&amp;V of $511 million, higher CAS predominately resulting from cost inflation impacts and lower sales volumes for all metals except copper. These decreases were partially offset by lower reclamation and remediation expense resulting from adjustments mainly related to non-operating Yanacocha sites, lower income tax expense and the loss on assets held for sale in 2021 related to the Conga mill assets.Net loss from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders for the quarter was $(1.5) billion or $(1.87) per diluted share, a decrease of $1.4 billion from the prior year quarter primarily due to the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter and higher CAS predominately resulting from cost inflation impacts. These decreases were partially offset by lower reclamation and remediation expense resulting from adjustments mainly related to non-operating Yanacocha sites, and lower income and mining tax expense.Adjusted net income4 for the year was $1.5 billion or $1.85 per diluted share, compared to $2.4 billion or $2.96 per diluted share in the prior year. Primary adjustments to 2022 net income include total impairment charges of $1.3 billion, reclamation and remediation adjustments primarily related to non-operating Yanacocha and Porcupine sites of $713 million and a pension settlement charge of $137 million.Adjusted net income for the quarter was $348 million or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $624 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments to fourth quarter net income include total impairment charges of $1.3 billion, reclamation and remediation adjustments of $700 million and a gain on asset and investment sales of $61 million primarily related to the sale of the investment in MARA.Adjusted EBITDA5 for the year decreased 24 percent to $4.6 billion, compared to $6.0 billion for the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter decreased 27 percent to $1.2 billion for the quarter, compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year quarter.Capital expenditures6 increased 29 percent to $2.1 billion for the full year and increased 46 percent to $646 million for the quarter, compared to prior year, primarily due to higher development capital spend during a period of meaningful reinvestment, as well as slightly higher sustaining capital. Development capital expenditures in 2022 primarily related to Tanami Expansion 2, Yanacocha Sulfides, Ahafo North, Pamour and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1.Consolidated operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased 25 percent to $3.2 billion for the full year compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in operating cash expenditures resulting from the impacts of inflation on input costs and lower consolidated sales volumes, as well as several payments made during the year, including a $95 million payment related to the Peñasquito profit-sharing agreement related to 2021 results, an $83 million payment related to the Ghanaian employment model change and a $39 million payment related to our strategic alliance with Caterpillar Inc.Consolidated operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased 22 percent to $1.0 billion for the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase in operating cash expenditures resulting from the impacts of inflation on input costs, lower consolidated sales volumes and lower average realized metal prices for all metals except silver.Free Cash Flow7 decreased to $1.1 billion for the full year and $0.4 billion for the quarter, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital expenditures.Balance sheet and liquidity remained strong in 2022, ending the year with $2.9 billion of consolidated cash and $829 million of time deposits with a maturity of less than one year, with approximately $6.7 billion of total liquidity; reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 0.5x8.Nevada Gold Mines (NGM) attributable gold production for the year was 1,169 thousand ounces, with CAS of $989 per ounce2 and AISC of $1,220 per ounce3.

Newmont's 2023 and longer-term outlook includes current development capital costs and production related to Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, Pamour and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1. Development capital outlook for 2023 and 2024 includes spend related to the Yanacocha Sulfides project ahead of the investment decision planned for late 2024; additional development capital spend and all metal production for Yanacocha Sulfides has been excluded from longer-term outlook beginning in 2025.Additional projects not listed below represent incremental improvements to the Company's outlook.Tanami Expansion 2 (Australia) secures Tanami’s future as a long-life, low-cost producer by extending mine life beyond 2040 through the addition of a 1,460 meter hoisting shaft and supporting infrastructure to process 3.3 million tonnes per year and provide a platform for future growth. The expansion is expected to increase average annual gold production by approximately 150,000 to 200,000 ounces per year for the first five years and reduce operating costs by approximately 10 percent, bringing average all-in sustaining costs to $900 to $1,000 per ounce for Tanami (2026-2030). Commercial production for the project is expected in the second half of 2025. As previously indicated in July 2022, total capital costs are estimated to be between $1.2 and $1.3 billion, incorporating the significant impacts from Covid-related restrictions and protocols and the current market conditions for labor and materials. Development costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $499 million, of which $215 million related to 2022.Ahafo North (Africa) expands our existing footprint in Ghana with four open pit mines and a stand-alone mill located approximately 30 kilometers from the Company’s Ahafo South operations. The project is expected to add between 275,000 and 325,000 ounces per year with all-in sustaining costs of $800 to $900 per ounce for the first five full years of production. Ahafo North is the best unmined gold deposit in West Africa with approximately 3.8 million ounces of Reserves and 1.4 million ounces of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources and significant upside potential to extend beyond Ahafo North’s current 13-year mine life. Commercial production for the project is expected in the second half of 2025. As previously indicated in July 2022, total capital costs are estimated to be between $950 and $1,050 million, incorporating the cost associated with delayed land access. Development costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $212 million, of which $145 million related to 2022.Yanacocha Sulfides (South America) will develop the first phase of sulfide deposits and an integrated processing circuit, including an autoclave to produce 45% gold, 45% copper and 10% silver. The first phase focuses on developing the Yanacocha Verde and Chaquicocha deposits to extend Yanacocha’s operations beyond 2040 with second and third phases having the potential to extend life for multiple decades. In the third quarter of 2022, Newmont announced the decision to delay the project in order to manage project execution risk, move out of a period of significant inflation and to balance development capital cash flows. Management continues to assess the execution and project timeline, up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure; the project remains subject to an investment decision. Development capital spend on the project is expected to be approximately $300 to $350 million per year in 2023 and 2024 related to advanced engineering, procurement and completing camp construction.Pamour (North America) extends the life of Porcupine and maintains production beyond 2024. The project will optimize mill capacity, adding volume and supporting high grade ore from Borden and Hoyle Pond, while supporting further exploration in a highly prospective and proven mining district. An investment decision is now expected in late 2023 as opportunities have been identified to extend production from current operations, allowing for a deferral of project spending. Formal updates to capital estimates and estimated project completion will be provided closer to the investment decision.Cerro Negro District Expansion 1 (South America) includes the simultaneous development of the Marianas and Eastern districts to extend the mine life of Cerro Negro beyond 2030. The project is expected to improve production to above 350,000 ounces beginning in 2024 and provides a platform for further exploration and future growth through additional expansions. Development capital costs for the project are now estimated to be between $350 and $450 million, incorporating inflationary pressures and supply chain impacts in Argentina.* Project estimates remain subject to change based upon uncertainties, including future market conditions, continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation, commodities and raw materials prices, supply chain disruptions, labor markets, engineering and mine plan assumptions, future funding decisions, consideration of strategic capital allocation and other factors, which may impact estimated capital expenditures, AISC and timing of projects.

This is supported by a steady base from Newmont's world class assets and is further enhanced by the Company’s other operating mines and ownership in the Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo joint ventures. The 2023 outlook of 5.7 to 6.3 million ounces is expected to remain stable compared to 2022, driven by strong production at Ahafo and Boddington, partially offset by decreases at Peñasquito due to planned mine sequencing, the updated mine plan for a leach-only operation at CC&amp;V and the previously signaled delay of commercial production at Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2 to 2025. Beginning in 2024, production is expected to increase to between 5.9 and 6.5 million ounces, increasing to between 6.1 to 6.7 million ounces longer-term in 2026, due to natural mine sequencing and the inclusion of profitable production from Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2, in addition to reaching higher gold grade at Peñasquito.Costs are expected to improve throughout the five-year period, driven by declining inflationary pressure assumptions, increasing production levels and cost reduction initiatives. 2023 CAS is expected to be between $870 and $970 per ounce, with approximately 3% in cost escalation assumed as cost pressures are expected to persist from 2022. Longer-term, CAS is expected to improve to between $750 and $850 per ounce beginning in 2026 with the benefit of the near-term projects at Tanami and Ahafo North contributing profitable production, in addition to an improving cost and production profile at Nevada Gold Mines. AISC is expected to be between $1,150 and $1,250 per ounce in 2023, and improve to between $1,000 and $1,100 per ounce longer-term beginning in 2025.CO-PRODUCT PRODUCTION AND COST OUTLOOKGuidance Metric2023E2024E2025E2026E2027ECopper ($3.50/lb price assumption)Copper Production (Mlb)95 - 10585 - 9545 - 5545 - 5555 - 65Copper CAS ($/lb)*$1.85 - $2.15Copper AISC ($/lb)*$2.35 - $2.65Silver ($20/oz price assumption)Silver Production (Moz)31 - 3532 - 3635 - 3928 - 3230 - 34Silver CAS ($/oz)*$11.10 - $12.10Silver AISC ($/oz)*$15.50 - $16.50Lead ($0.90/lb price assumption)Lead Production (Mlb)170 - 190190 - 210210 - 230160 - 180250 - 270Lead CAS ($/lb)*$0.55 - $0.65Lead AISC ($/lb)*$0.70 - $0.80Zinc ($1.35/lb price assumption)Zinc Production (Mlb)420 - 460550 - 590580 - 620460 - 500400 - 440Zinc CAS ($/lb)*$0.65 - $0.75Zinc AISC ($/lb)*$1.05 - $1.15*Consolidated basisIn 2023, Boddington is expected to have the highest copper production during the five-year period due to higher grades as a result of mine sequencing.

This incorporates slightly higher spend as compared to 2022 due to higher costs driven by inflationary pressures and increased projected spend on tailings facilities in compliance with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM).Development capital for the five-year outlook includes spend for Tanami Expansion 2 in Australia, Ahafo North in Ghana, Cerro Negro District Expansion 1 in Argentina, Pamour at Porcupine in Canada, as well as development capital related to the Company’s ownership interest in Nevada Gold Mines including Goldrush. Outlook for 2023 and 2024 includes development capital spend of approximately $300 to $350 million per year related to the Yanacocha Sulfides project under the assumption that an investment decision would be made in late 2024; remaining development capital beyond 2024 has been excluded from longer-term outlook. As previously signaled, Newmont is critically assessing options for the Yanacocha Sulfides project, up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure, which may have an impact on expected capital spend included in outlook for 2023 and 2024.Development capital estimates exclude contributions to support Newmont’s 40% interest in the Pueblo Viejo expansion, which is accounted for as an equity method investment.EXPLORATION AND ADVANCED PROJECTS OUTLOOKGuidance Metric ($M)2023EExploration &amp; Advanced Projects$475 - $525In 2023, investment in exploration and advanced projects is expected to increase slightly to between $475 and $525 million to advance greenfield exploration projects, extend mine life at existing operations and continue building reserves. We expect to invest approximately $225 million dollars in exploration expense to progress our most promising greenfield exploration projects including Esperance in French Guiana and the Coffee project in the Yukon. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $275 million in advanced projects spend, as we continue to advance studies associated with our robust pipeline of projects, including Galore Creek and Akyem Underground.

Due to this planned mine sequence, gold grade in 2023 is expected to decline approximately 25 percent from 2022. Notably, 2023 production is expected to be weighted in the first and third quarters of the year as the operation sequences processing of Chile Colorado ore. In 2024, gold production is expected to improve due to mine phasing leading to the processing of higher grade ore.Increased co-product production at Peñasquito is expected in 2023 due to higher silver, lead and zinc content delivered from the Chile Colorado pit.Gold unit costs at Peñasquito are expected to be impacted by lower production volumes in 2023, while co-product unit costs are expected to benefit from higher production volumes.Boddington2023EProduction (oz) / (lb)CAS ($/unit)AISC ($/unit)Gold (Koz)740 - 820$800 - $900$960 - $1,060Copper (Mlb)95 - 105$1.85 - $2.15$2.35 - $2.65Gold production at Boddington is expected to remain relatively consistent in 2023 as compared to 2022. Based on mine sequencing, gold production is expected to decline in 2024 and 2025 due to lower grade ore and stripping in the South pit.Increased copper production at Boddington is expected in 2023 due to higher grade and mill throughput.Gold unit costs at Boddington are expected to remain relatively consistent in 2023 with 2022 levels, while copper unit costs are expected to increase slightly due to higher direct costs, with higher all-in sustaining costs due to higher sustaining capital spend.Ahafo2023EProduction (Koz)CAS ($/oz)AISC ($/oz)Gold675 - 745$850 - $950$1,010 - $1,110Production at Ahafo is expected to increase in 2023, continuing through 2024, due to higher grade at the Subika open pit and increased underground tonnes mined due to the change in the mining method at Subika Underground. In 2023, gold production is expected to steadily increase each quarter due to the progression of work at Subika Underground, resulting in production that is expected to be approximately 60 percent weighted to the second half of the year.Unit costs at Ahafo are expected to improve in 2023 due to higher production volumes.Ahafo North will add profitable production beginning in 2025, with the first full year of production expected in 2026, improving margins through low-cost production.Tanami2023EProduction (Koz)CAS ($/oz)AISC ($/oz)Gold420 - 460$770 - $870$1,130 - $1,230Tanami production is expected to decrease slightly beginning in 2023 and continuing through 2024 due to lower ore grade from planned mine sequencing to allow for expansion construction underground, with higher production beginning in 2025 from the ramp-up of Tanami Expansion 2.Notably, in the first quarter of 2023, record rainfall and associated flooding resulted in the closure of the main access route for supplies. As a result, milling operations were ceased for a few weeks in the first quarter. Incorporating the impact of this delay, production at Tanami is expected to be significantly weighted to the second half of the year.Unit costs at Tanami are expected to be impacted by lower production volumes in 2023 and are expected to benefit from improved underground efficiencies as the second expansion comes online in 2025.Cerro Negro2023EProduction (Koz)CAS ($/oz)AISC ($/oz)Gold315 - 345$850 - $950$1,060 - $1,160Cerro Negro production is expected to steadily increase compared to 2022 and continuing longer-term due to higher throughput and grade from productivity improvements, as well as added production from San Marcos in the Marianas district expansion in late 2023. These improvements are expected to steadily increase each quarter in 2023, resulting in production weighted approximately 55 percent to the second half of the year. The first expansion at Cerro Negro includes the development of the Marianas and Eastern districts, adding production beginning in 2023.Cerro Negro unit costs are expected to steadily improve beginning in 2023 due to higher production volumes.Akyem2023EProduction (Koz)CAS ($/oz)AISC ($/oz)Gold315 - 345$850 - $950$1,110 - $1,210Akyem production is expected to decrease in 2023 as stripping begins for a new layback to extend mine life, with stripping expected to peak in 2024.Akyem unit costs are expected to be impacted by lower production volumes due to mine sequencing in 2023.Porcupine2023EProduction (Koz)CAS ($/oz)AISC ($/oz)Gold285 - 315$950 - $1,050$1,250 - $1,350Porcupine is expected to benefit from productivity improvements and slightly higher grades in 2023, as additional opportunities continue to be identified to extend production from current operations. The Pamour project is expected to maintain steady production at Porcupine beyond 2024, with an investment decision expected in late 2023.Porcupine unit costs are expected to be impacted slightly by unfavorable inventory changes in 2023, with higher all-in sustaining costs due to higher sustaining capital spend.Éléonore2023EProduction (Koz)CAS ($/oz)AISC ($/oz)Gold265 - 295$960 - $1,060$1,300 - $1,400Éléonore is expected to deliver higher production in 2023 due to higher underground tonnes and throughput from productivity improvements, with steadily improving production expected longer-term.Éléonore unit costs are expected to benefit from higher production volumes in 2023.Yanacocha2023EProduction (Koz)CAS ($/oz)AISC ($/oz)Gold255 - 285$1,370 - $1,470$1,620 - $1,720Yanacocha continues to deliver leach-only production, with increased production expected in 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher leach recoveries from the use of injection leaching.

128,7b83c853-2b6b-39fe-bdc5-5f39c625aeb1,NEM,2023-02-23,Newmont's (NYSE:NEM one-year decrease in earnings delivers investors with a 31% loss,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmonts-nyse-nem-one-decrease-110559322.html,1677150359,STORY,['NEM'],"[The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. For example, the Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) share price is down 34% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 7.5%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 4.9% in three years. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 17% in a month.After losing 3.5% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. See our latest analysis for Newmont In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Unfortunately Newmont reported an EPS drop of 51% for the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 34% the share price fall. It may have been that the weak EPS was not as bad as some had feared.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Newmont's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Newmont, it has a TSR of -31% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 7.5% in the twelve months, Newmont shareholders did even worse, losing 31% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Newmont is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NEM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 47 cents per share for NEM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NEM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +11.41% heading into earnings season.Newmont Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNewmont Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNewmont Corporation price-eps-surprise | Newmont Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that NEM has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

They asked to be anonymous because the information is not yet public.Those problems included repeated outages at its Prelude liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility off the western coast of Australia and a major malfunction at its Pernis refinery in the Netherlands, Europe's largest, when supplies were strained in the initial aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.Sawan announced the role of chief of staff and corporate relations in an internal memo last week, the sources said. The decision has not been previously reported.A Shell spokesperson confirmed the role has been created, without adding details.The chief of staff will not be a permanent member of Shell's executive committee, where major decisions are discussed, but will be able to take part in its meetings, the sources said.The person named to the job will be made public at the end of March, along with senior appointments that will take effect on July 1, the sources said.Leading candidates to the role include Katie Jackson, head of acquisitions and divestments, Richard Tallant, managing director of Qatar Shell and Australia country chair Tony Nunan, two of the sources said.Story continuesSawan has said he will improve Shell's performance and efficiency as it attempts to shift towards low-carbon energy and cut greenhouse emissions in the coming decades.""With fewer roles and greater accountability, simplifying decision-making, by building on our strength and focusing on performance and simplification, we intend to deliver compelling shareholder returns,"" Sawan said after Shell reported earlier this month record profits of $40 billion in 2022.Shell plans to keep its capital spending largely unchanged at around $25 billion in 2023, but operating costs are set to rise as the costs of services increase, inflation stays high and recent acquisitions are integrated.Sawan announced at the end of January a major change to Shell's structure, combining Shell's oil and gas production and liquefied natural gas (LNG) divisions under current Upstream Director Zoe Yujnovich. Renewable energy operations will come under oil refining and marketing operations led by current Downstream Director Huibert Vigeveno.Shell last underwent a major overhaul at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when then-CEO Ben van Beurden cut more than 10% of the company's workforce as part of his push to steer the company towards energy transition.Wael will officially announce Shell's long-term strategy in June.

To be fair, many people have fear mongered about this topic and I’m not about to contribute to the cause. Still, the core principle still applies. We, humans, need to be good stewards of natural resources.Further, the issue of climate change has become a serious concern over the past several years. Respectfully, the matter carries significant debate. Still, the broader scientific consensus indicates considerable damage to the environment. While renewables represent one segment of a wider protocol, the push for solutions certainly helps renewable energy stocks to buy.Finally, unlike some other sectors, hardly any cynicism exists in this space.

Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockOne of the biggest names among renewable energy stocks to buy, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization, per its public profile. Further, its website states that NextEra ranks among the largest capital investors in infrastructure in the U.S. Despite significant relevancies, NEE slipped nearly 10% since the January opener. However, this could open doors for contrarian investors.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), NextEra rates as a modestly undervalued investment. Objectively, though, the company’s biggest strength centers on its profitability metrics. In particular, its net margin stands at 19.79%, ranked better than 85% of the competition. Plus, its return on equity pings at 11.07%, better than 65% of its peers.Story continuesAlso, its three-year dividend growth rate is 10.8%. In contrast, the sector median is only 5%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg NEE as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target hit $95.73, implying over 26% upside potential.Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comA publicly traded limited partnership, Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) owns and operates renewable power assets. Carrying an attractive asset portfolio, Brookfield ranks among the more enticing renewable energy stocks to buy. Per its public profile, as of the end of 2017, it owned over 200 hydroelectric plants, 100 wind farms, over 550 solar facilities, and four storage facilities, with approximately 16,400 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity.Unlike NextEra above, Brookfield got off to a solid start in the new year, popping up nearly 7%. However, in the trailing year, shares dipped more than 19%. Still, this might present an opportunity for contrarian investors. Currently, the market prices BEP at 1.68 times (trailing) sales. As a discount to growth, Brookfield ranks better than 61.68% of the competition.Also worth noting is that BEP trades hands at 5.59 times operating cash flow. For comparison, the sector median is 8.81 times. Plus, Wall Street analysts appreciate BEP, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $35.97, implying an upside potential of 30%.Enphase Energy (ENPH)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Fremont, California, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) specializes in energy technology. Specifically, Enphase focuses on the development and manufacturing of solar micro-inverters, battery energy storage, and electric vehicle charging stations primarily for residential customers. In the trailing year, ENPH gained nearly 37% of its equity value, making it one of the top performers among renewable energy stocks to buy.However, in the new year, circumstances have been less than auspicious for Enphase. Since the Jan. opener, ENPH dropped 20% in the charts. Nevertheless, contrarians might take that as their cure to buy in. For instance, Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations peg Enphase as significantly undervalued.Objectively, the company enjoys a bonkers growth rate of 50.4% during the past three years. As well, its net margin stands at a very healthy 17%. Further, its Altman Z-Score pings at 9.79, indicating very low bankruptcy risk. Presently, covering analysts assess ENPH as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target of $301.50 implies a nearly 49% upside potential. Therefore, it’s a strong name to keep on your radar for renewable energy stocks to buy.Clearway Energy (CWEN)ESG stocks: Solar energy panels are arranged in a green field under a sunny sky.Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.comWhile Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) might not get as much attention as the top-tier players among renewable energy stocks to buy, it more than holds its own as an industry competitor. According to its website, Clearway is one of the largest renewable energy owners in the US with over 5,500 net MW of installed wind and solar generation projects.As a chart performer, CWEN has been providing choppy but generally positive growth. In the trailing year, shares gained a bit more than 2%. Further, for patient investors, CWEN may have more room to run. Notably, the market prices CWEN at a trailing multiple of 6.83. As a discount to earnings, Clearway outpaces nearly 81% of the industry.Also, CWEN trades at 5.61 times free cash flow (FCF). In contrast, the sector median pings at a lofty 10.76 times. Thus, it offers a discounted play among renewable energy stocks to buy. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg CWEN as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $37.50, implying 14% upside potential.Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE)A concept image of a person's hands holding a plant with floating glowing particles around itSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Newport Beach, California, Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE) focuses on renewable natural gas (RNG). According to the U.S. Department of Energy, “…RNG can be used as a transportation fuel in the form of compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG). RNG qualifies as an advanced biofuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard.” Because of the underlying asset’s strong implications, Clean Energy Fuels ranks among the renewable energy stocks to buy.However, from a financial perspective, CLNE presents incredible risks so prospective investors must conduct due diligence. First, Gurufocus.com warns its readers that Clean Energy Fuels may be a value trap. As well, it appears overvalued. For instance, CLEN trades at 3.3 times (trailing) sales, ranking worse than over 80% of the competition.That said, not everything about Clean Energy is terrible. On its balance sheet, the company carries a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.74 times, outpacing nearly 65% of the industry. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.77 times, above nearly 82% of its peers.Perhaps most compelling of all, UBS initiated coverage on CLNE two months ago with a $12 price target. This forecast implies a whopping 105.48% upside potential. Thus, it’s an enticing trade among renewable energy stocks to buy.Natural Resource Partners (NRP)A man holds coal in his hands over a pile of more coalSource: ShutterstockTo be clear, Natural Resource Partners (NYSE:NRP) is a diversified natural resource company that owns, manages, and leases a diversified portfolio of properties. Specifically, we’re talking about soda ash, which represents a key raw material in the processing of lithium. Also, the company owns the right to conduct carbon sequestration and renewable energy activities.On the financial front, Natural Resource requires considerable patience. Per Gurufocus.com, the company may represent a possible value trap. It’s not entirely unjustified in this assessment. However, more recent data suggests that NRP just needs some extra time. For instance, in its third quarter of 2022, NRP posted revenue of $87.3 million, up over 74% against the year-ago quarter.Also, the company’s trailing-12-month revenue stands at $320.4 million. That would represent a multi-year high going back to the end of 2015. As well, it enjoys outstanding profitability metrics. Its return on assets stands at over 28%, reflecting an extremely high-quality business. Therefore, for the careful contrarian, NRP could be an interesting candidate for renewable energy stocks to buy.Hallador Energy (HNRG)An image of heaps of coalSource: ShutterstockBilling itself as a leader in the broader energy ecosystem, Hallador Energy (NASDAQ:HNRG) beats around the bush regarding what it does, which is frustrating I must say. However, drilling into the details, it specializes in generating power and its means of doing so is through coal. However, the company also owns a subsidiary unit called Hallador Renewables, which focuses on solar energy infrastructures.To be completely transparent, HNRG represents one of the riskiest names among renewable energy stocks to buy. Presently, Gurufocus.com warns that based on its proprietary FMV calculations, Hallador’s significantly overvalued. Also, against most other metrics, the discount just doesn’t exist.However, it’s not a completely hopeless investment on paper. For example, the market prices HNRG at 1.48 times its tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median is 1.74 times. Finally, only one analyst from B. Riley Financial covers HNRG with a lackluster “hold” view. However, the expert’s $9 price target implies over 9% upside potential. That’s not too bad considering HNRG already skyrocketed almost 154% in the trailing year.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Shares have lost about 1.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Synchrony due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Synchrony Financial Q4 Earnings Beat on Loan GrowthSynchrony Financial has reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.5%. However, the bottom line dropped nearly 15% year over year.The net interest income of SYF amounted to $4,106 million, which improved 7.2% year over year. The top line beat the consensus mark by 1.7% and came higher than our estimate of $3,930.2 million.The quarterly results have benefited from a rising loan receivables portfolio paving the way for higher interest and fees on loans. A growing purchase volume, resulting from increased contributions from its five sales platforms, also contributed to the upside. However, the quarterly results have been partly offset by rising benchmark rates, elevated expenses and reduced average active accounts.Q4 Results in DetailOther income of Synchrony Financial plunged 82% year over year to $30 million in the fourth quarter and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63 million. The decline was due to elevated loyalty costs and a gain on venture investment in the previous year.Total loan receivables of SYF were $92.5 billion, which rose 14.5% year over year and beat our estimate of $89.9 billion in the quarter under review.Total deposits of $71.7 billion advanced 15.2% year over year.

The improvement came on the back of increased purchase volume and moderated payment rates. It also remains the common factor boosting loan receivables growth on the remaining four sales platforms. Purchase volume advanced 8.6% year over year to $11,860 million, riding on rising Home spending and improved prices in furniture. Interest and fees on loans of $1,264 million climbed 12.3% year over year and came higher than our estimate of $1,168.4 million.Digital period-end loan receivables totaled $25,522 million, which rose 17.3% year over year in the quarter under review.

They asked to be anonymous because the information is not yet public.Those problems included repeated outages at its Prelude liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility off the western coast of Australia and a major malfunction at its Pernis refinery in the Netherlands, Europe's largest, when supplies were strained in the initial aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.Sawan announced the role of chief of staff and corporate relations in an internal memo last week, the sources said. The decision has not been previously reported.A Shell spokesperson confirmed the role has been created, without adding details.The chief of staff will not be a permanent member of Shell's executive committee, where major decisions are discussed, but will be able to take part in its meetings, the sources said.The person named to the job will be made public at the end of March, along with senior appointments that will take effect on July 1, the sources said.Leading candidates to the role include Katie Jackson, head of acquisitions and divestments, Richard Tallant, managing director of Qatar Shell and Australia country chair Tony Nunan, two of the sources said.Story continuesSawan has said he will improve Shell's performance and efficiency as it attempts to shift towards low-carbon energy and cut greenhouse emissions in the coming decades.""With fewer roles and greater accountability, simplifying decision-making, by building on our strength and focusing on performance and simplification, we intend to deliver compelling shareholder returns,"" Sawan said after Shell reported earlier this month record profits of $40 billion in 2022.Shell plans to keep its capital spending largely unchanged at around $25 billion in 2023, but operating costs are set to rise as the costs of services increase, inflation stays high and recent acquisitions are integrated.Sawan announced at the end of January a major change to Shell's structure, combining Shell's oil and gas production and liquefied natural gas (LNG) divisions under current Upstream Director Zoe Yujnovich. Renewable energy operations will come under oil refining and marketing operations led by current Downstream Director Huibert Vigeveno.Shell last underwent a major overhaul at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when then-CEO Ben van Beurden cut more than 10% of the company's workforce as part of his push to steer the company towards energy transition.Wael will officially announce Shell's long-term strategy in June.

""The CHIPS and Science Act presents us with an opportunity to make investments that are similarly consequential for our nation’s future.”Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo speaks about semiconductors at the White House in September. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)Raimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.The speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works— and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.""Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,"" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America’s national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.Story continuesIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law ""the most significant competition policy in our generation."" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.The overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the “premier destination in the world” for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that “every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.”'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'The Biden administration’s challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.The situation is even worse with the world’s most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.Raimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. ""That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,"" she said.President Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Raimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.“Our success will be short-lived"" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&amp;D is what will make it a longer term success.""It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,"" she said.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added ""as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.""The new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer’s capital expenditures.Return on investment? National security. Raimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln’s creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy’s famous call to put a man on the moon.She noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy’s 1961 call—and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The next step in the administration’s plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo’s department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. “It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,” Raimondo told reporters.The speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.""I expect to be held accountable,"" Raimondo said.Meanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.Raimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.""Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,"" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country.

As we can see in the chart below, EXPE has primarily struggled to exceed expectations within this metric.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPeter Kern, CEO, on the quarter, “We were pleased that we were able to deliver our most profitable year in 2022, despite the friction from transforming our business model and technology platform. While our Q4 results were negatively impacted by severe weather, demand was otherwise strong and accelerating, and has been markedly stronger since the start of the year.”Expedia shares lost roughly 8% in the following trading session.Booking HoldingsQuarterly Estimates – Analysts have taken a bullish stance for the quarter to be reported, with five positive earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last several months.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Lockheed Martin's shares before the 28th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$3.00 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$12.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Lockheed Martin has a trailing yield of 2.5% on the current stock price of $479.53. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Lockheed Martin has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Lockheed Martin paid out more than half (52%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 49% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Lockheed Martin's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 28% per annum for the past five years. Management appears to be striking a nice balance between reinvesting for growth and paying dividends to shareholders. With a reasonable payout ratio, profits being reinvested, and some earnings growth, Lockheed Martin could have strong prospects for future increases to the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Lockheed Martin has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Lockheed Martin for the upcoming dividend? We like Lockheed Martin's growing earnings per share and the fact that - while its payout ratio is around average - it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow. There's a lot to like about Lockheed Martin, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.So while Lockheed Martin looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.16% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.26%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.58%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the aerospace and defense company had gained 6.67% over the past month. This has outpaced the Aerospace sector's gain of 5% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.84% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Lockheed Martin as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Lockheed Martin is projected to report earnings of $6.18 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 4.04%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.95 billion, down 0.07% from the prior-year quarter.LMT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $26.84 per share and revenue of $65.8 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -1.43% and -0.28%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.75% lower within the past month. Lockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Lockheed Martin's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 17.85. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.1.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that LMT has a PEG ratio of 2.6. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Aerospace - Defense stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.36 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector.

158,2f9b899f-1dd0-3533-862d-0e938752a4f2,LMT,2023-02-23,Is Lockheed Martin (LMT) a Good Pick for Value Investors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-lmt-good-pick-145802622.html,1677077882,STORY,"['LMT', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Lockheed Martin has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.48, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 18.39. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Lockheed Martin’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint (which is 16.55) over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Aerospace sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 40.45. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesWe should also point out that Lockheed Martin has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 17.72, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Lockheed Martin stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Lockheed Martin has a P/S ratio of about 1.88. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.64x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Lockheed Martin currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Lockheed Martin a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Lockheed Martin might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of F. This gives LMT a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been dismal at best. The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen none up and six down in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 2.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and ConsensusLockheed Martin Corporation Price and ConsensusLockheed Martin Corporation price-consensus-chart | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteThis negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineLockheed Martin is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 42% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence. However, over the past two years, the Zacks Aerospace – Defense industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Unitil has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while WEC Energy Group has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.

This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.42.Another notable valuation metric for UTL is its P/B ratio of 1.90. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Pharmaceutical Stocks Now. The pharmaceutical industry was the center of attention in 2020 and 2021 after the deadly coronavirus pandemic ravaged the globe and disrupted the way of living. As countries played hide and seek with lockdowns, it was left to pharmaceuticals to come up with a cure for a disease that in the early stages of the pandemic had flooded hospitals and overwhelmed graveyards.Fast forward to 2023 and the pandemic is a thing of the past. Vaccines such as those from Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are among some of the most advanced products in the world since they are capable of influencing cell function in the human body, making them perfect for developing long term immunity against the virus. The technology also reaped billions in dividends for the companies, particularly Moderna whose shares are up by a massive 826% over the past five years as the company which was a relatively unknown firm was transformed into a global household name.These days, the pharmaceutical industry is focusing on rising technologies such as artificial intelligence to crack the puzzle to defeat diseases such as cancer and thalassemia. Estimates made by the healthcare giant Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (OTCMKTS:BAYZF) show that the world's population is aging at a remarkable rate, with individuals aged 65 and above set to double to 1.5 billion by 2050. At the same time, the growth in noncommunicable and serious diseases, such as heart problems or cancer, is expected to grow at an equally fast rate, with China alone seeing such diseases to account for 80% of all deaths of people aged 60 or higher by 2030. Bayer goes on to estimate a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for the pharmaceutical industry, and keeping the aforementioned factors in mind, it believes that the sector can grow as fast as by 6% through 2025.Story continuesAnother research report, this time from Facts and Factors, has similar estimates for the market. It lays down a 5.7% CAGR for the industry from 2022 to 2028 and believes that the sector, which was worth $1.4 billion last year, will be worth $2 billion by the end of the forecast period. Like Bayer, Facts and Factors also believes that diseases such as cancer and diabetes will fuel this growth and that growth in the population of elderly people will result in a higher demand for pharmaceutical products. It adds that companies are using machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing to enhance their manufacturing processes, and states that North America was the largest pharmaceutical market in 2021.Today's piece will look at some well performing pharmaceutical firms, with the top picks being Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

All four members of Congress are Democrats.They expressed particular concern over Merck's efforts to patent a subcutaneous version of the currently infused drug, which Reuters reported on late last year.They wrote that Merck’s use of dozens of patents to fend off Keytruda competitors ""appear(s) to be an example of the anti-competitive business practices ... that we have long been concerned about.""Merck, which reported $20.9 billion in 2022 sales of Keytruda, has relied on the immunotherapy to fuel its growth.The treatment, first approved in 2014, harnesses the body's own immune system to fight cancers with dramatic results. Against advanced lung cancer, it has led to a five-year survival rate in about one-quarter of people compared to 5% historically for the disease.It initially demonstrated impressive survival benefits in the deadliest form of skin cancer and has since been approved for many types of cancer.The members of Congress wrote that subcutaneous injections do not represent novel improvements for drugs, as ""medications have been injected under the skin since insulin was discovered in 1921.""They urged Vidal to ""give close scrutiny to any of Merck’s requests for new patents for Keytruda, and reject those that do not clearly meet the agency’s standards.""

We are grateful to the FDA for this designation.""""This is an important milestone in the development of mRNA-4157/V940 in combination with KEYTRUDA,"" said Dr. Eric H. Rubin, senior vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We look forward to working with the FDA, in collaboration with Moderna, to conduct a rigorous and rapid clinical development program with a focus on addressing the needs of this important patient population.""Story continuesThe FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation is granted to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition, and when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on at least one clinically significant endpoint.[i]The companies will continue to discuss the results with regulatory authorities, initiate a Phase 3 study in adjuvant melanoma in 2023, and rapidly expand to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer.About mRNA-4157/V940mRNA-4157/V940 is a novel investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based personalized cancer vaccine consisting of a single synthetic mRNA coding for up to 34 neoantigens that is designed and produced based on the unique mutational signature of the patient's tumor. Upon administration into the body, the algorithmically derived and mRNA-encoded neoantigen sequences are endogenously translated and undergo natural cellular antigen processing and presentation, a key step in adaptive immunity.Personalized cancer vaccines are designed to prime the immune system so that a patient can generate a tailored antitumor response specific to their tumor mutation signature. mRNA-4157/V940 is designed to stimulate an immune response by generating specific T cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient's tumor. KEYTRUDA is an immunotherapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Based on early clinical studies, combining mRNA-4157/V940 with KEYTRUDA may potentially provide an additive benefit and enhance T cell-mediated destruction of tumor cells.About KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (NCT03897881)KEYNOTE-942 is an ongoing randomized, open-label Phase 2b trial that enrolled 157 patients with stage III/IV melanoma. Following complete surgical resection, patients were randomized to receive mRNA-4157/V940 (nine total doses of mRNA-4157) and KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks up to 18 cycles [for approximately one year]) versus KEYTRUDA alone for approximately one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival, and secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free survival and safety.Key eligibility criteria for the trial included: patients with resectable cutaneous melanoma at high risk of recurrence, patients with complete resection within 13 weeks prior to the first dose of KEYTRUDA, patients were disease free at study entry (after surgery) with no loco-regional relapse or distant metastasis and no clinical evidence of brain metastases.About MelanomaMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades, with nearly 325,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. In the U.S., skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed, and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. Each year, it is estimated there will be nearly 100,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and almost 8,000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. The five-year survival rates are estimated to be 60.3% for stage III and 16.2% for stage IV.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.SMelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk.

You can skip our detailed discussion on dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best March Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend-paying companies have historically been a popular choice for income-seeking investors. These stocks have provided higher returns to shareholders along with a growing stream of income. In 2022, dividend stocks recorded their best performance, with companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributing over $561 billion worth of dividends to shareholders, up from $511.2 billion in 2021, as reported by Wall Street Journal. Analysts expect the figure to grow this year as well, as companies are steadily raising their payouts.Dividend stocks are often considered good investments during inflationary periods. A Fidelity’s report highlighted the performance of dividends in the 1940s and the 1970s when inflation was at its highest. During these decades, dividends represented 65% and 71% of the S&amp;P 500’s total return, respectively.Over the years, growth in dividend stocks has outpaced inflation. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, dividends have grown by an average of 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, compared with a 3.68% growth in inflation. The report further mentioned that dividends and reinvested dividends represented nearly 69% of the US stock market’s return since 1978. In this regard, dividend growers like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are particularly popular among investors.When investing in dividend stocks, investors often purchase stocks before the company’s ex-dividend date. Through this, investors seek to capture the dividend payout while eliminating exposure to the stock’s price movements. This strategy also allows them to potentially generate a higher yield than by simply holding a stock for the long term. To know more about this, readers can also have a look at Dividend Capture Strategy: 10 High-Yield Stocks to Buy in February, which discussed the dividend capture strategy in detail.

For further information on the items that impacted comparability of 2022 and 2021, see the footnotes accompanying tables presenting Supplemental Segment Data and reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (non-GAAP measures) to their comparable GAAP financial measures.RECENT HIGHLIGHTSSelected for Ready Wyoming Transmission Project - In January 2023, Quanta was selected by Black Hills Corporation's Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power to provide EPC solutions for the Ready Wyoming Project. Quanta's scope of work for the project consists of the management and construction of approximately 260 miles of 230 kV and 115 kV transmission infrastructure and six new and expanded substations in Wyoming and western Nebraska. Construction is planned to start this year with final completion expected by the end of 2025. Quanta expects to include the estimated revenue from this project in its remaining performance obligations and backlog for the Electric Power Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2023.Selected for Waasigan Transmission Line Project - In December 2022, Quanta was selected by Hydro One to provide EPC solutions for the proposed Waasigan Transmission Line project in northwestern Ontario, consisting of a new double-circuit and single-circuit 230 kV transmission line. Quanta expects to begin construction in late 2024, with completion expected in 2026. The estimated revenue from this project is included in remaining performance obligations and backlog for the Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment as of December 31, 2022.Selected for Colorado's Power Pathway Transmission Project - In December 2022, Quanta announced that it was selected by Xcel Energy as its prime constructor to manage all construction activities for Colorado's Power Pathway  high-voltage electric transmission project in Colorado. Quanta's scope of work on the project consists of the construction of approximately 610 miles of 345 kV transmission infrastructure, consisting of up to six segments and spanning more than a dozen counties, primarily in eastern Colorado, and includes the installation of four new substations and the expansion of four existing substations. Certain segments of the project are expected to be completed in 2025, with other segments expected to be completed in 2026 and 2027. Preconstruction activities have begun and construction on the first segment is scheduled to begin in mid-2023. Quanta included the estimated revenue for the project in remaining performance obligations and backlog for the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment as of December 31,  2022.Capital Deployment - In January 2023, Quanta acquired three businesses that primarily enhance Quanta's ability to deliver comprehensive infrastructure solutions to utility and renewable energy customers in the United States for aggregate consideration of approximately $588.5 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Quanta also repurchased 86,319 shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market for $11.4 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2022, Quanta repurchased 1,060,997 shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market for $127.7 million. Quanta currently has authorization under its existing stock repurchase program to acquire an additional $345.1 million of its common stock. Additionally, in December 2022, Quanta's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of $0.08 per share, or a rate of $0.32 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a 14% increase from Quanta's prior quarterly cash dividend paid in October 2022.RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021Revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 were $17.07 billion compared to revenues of $12.98 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021, and net income attributable to common stock was $491.2 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income attributable to common stock of $486.0 million, or $3.34 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $6.34 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $4.91 for the year ended December 31, 2021.FULL-YEAR 2023 OUTLOOK The long-term outlook for Quanta's business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, supply chain challenges and other factors affecting project timing and execution have impacted, and may impact in the future, Quanta's financial results. Additionally, we continue to consider future uncertainty associated with overall challenges to the domestic and global economy, including inflation, increased interest rates and recessionary economic conditions. Quanta's financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management's effort to align these uncertainties with the backlog (a non-GAAP measure) the Company is executing on and the opportunities expected to materialize during 2023.Prior to the Company's conference call, management will post a summary of Quanta's 2023 guidance expectations with additional commentary in the ""News and Events"" and ""Financial Info"" areas of the Investor Relations section of Quanta's website at http://investors.quantaservices.com.The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially, as described below in Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements and Information. For the full year ending December 31, 2023, Quanta expects revenues to range between $18.40 billion and $18.90 billion, net income attributable to common stock to range between $692 million and $766 million and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to range between $4.67 and $5.17. Quanta expects adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP financial measure) to range between $6.75 and $7.25, EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) to range between $1.69 billion and $1.81 billion, and adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) to range between $1.82 billion and $1.94 billion. Additionally, for the full year ending December 31, 2023, Quanta expects net cash attributable to operating activities to range between $1.15 billion and $1.40 billion and free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) to range between $750 million and $1.00 billion.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe financial measures not prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) that are utilized in this press release are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta's performance, excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta's operating results with those of its competitors.

Quanta believes this measure enables management to more effectively forecast its future capital needs and results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Mid-America Apartment Communities in FocusMid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is headquartered in Germantown, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 5.06% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.4 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.4%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield is 3.5%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.61%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $5.60 is up 19.8% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Mid-America Apartment Communities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.45%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Mid-America Apartment Communities's current payout ratio is 59%. This means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MAA expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $9.17 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 7.88%.Story continuesBottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MAA is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(TTDKY) and TE Connectivity (TEL). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, TDK Corp. is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while TE Connectivity has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This means that TTDKY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.TTDKY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.77, while TEL has a forward P/E of 19.17. We also note that TTDKY has a PEG ratio of 0.99. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TEL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.79.Another notable valuation metric for TTDKY is its P/B ratio of 1.16. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.16% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.58%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the athletic apparel maker had lost 4.52% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 0.25% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.84% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Nike as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be March 21, 2023. On that day, Nike is projected to report earnings of $0.50 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 42.53%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $11.37 billion, up 4.62% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.12 per share and revenue of $49.94 billion, which would represent changes of -16.8% and +6.92%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.56% higher. Nike is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Nike has a Forward P/E ratio of 38.81 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 13.84, which means Nike is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesInvestors should also note that NKE has a PEG ratio of 4.05 right now.

CRI is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 24, before the opening bell. The branded marketer of apparel, exclusively for babies and children in North America, is likely to witness a decline in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $869 million, indicating a decline of 18.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been unchanged at $1.74 in the past 30 days, suggesting a fall of 24.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.For 2022, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $6.37, suggesting a decline of 19.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion, suggesting a 9.1% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.We expect the company’s fourth-quarter revenues to decline 18.5% year over year to $865.7 million and the bottom line to decrease 28% to $1.66 per share. For 2022, we estimate a revenue decline of 9.2% to $3,166.3 million and earnings per share decrease of 19.9% to $6.30.The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.5%, on average. In the last reported quarter, CRI’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%.Carter's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Carter's, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCarter's, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Carter's, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteCarter’s has been witnessing drab sales across the U.S. Retail, U.S. Wholesale and International divisions. Inflationary pressure leading to a surge in gas and food prices and slowed demand for its brands have been hurting its performance. Also, increased ocean freight rates and distribution expenses are likely to have hurt margins in the fourth quarter.On its last reported quarter's earnings call, the company projected net sales of $845-$885 million for fourth-quarter 2022. Management envisioned adjusted earnings of $1.40-$2.00, down from $2.31 reported in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income is expected to be $85-$115 million, suggesting a decline from $137.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The fourth-quarter outlook reflects a tough macroeconomic environment, with U.S. Retail comparable sales expected to decline 10-15%. Moreover, U.S. Wholesale and International comparable sales are expected to decline.Carter’s projected 2022 net sales of $3.145-$3.185 billion, with adjusted earnings per share of $6.05-$6.65. Adjusted operating income is forecast to be $355-$385 million for 2022.We expect fourth-quarter 2022 sales to decline 16.3%, 22.2% and 19.5%, respectively, for the U.S. Retail, U.S. Wholesale and International divisions. For 2022, the aforementioned segments are expected to report sales decline of 12.7%, 5.3% and 4.2%, respectively.However, Carter’s continues to gain from efforts to strengthen e-commerce capabilities through investments to speed up deliveries. Expanded omnichannel facilities, including curbside pickup, same-day pickup, buy online and pickup at store, and ship from store, along with easy access to a broad array of online products when shopping in stores, are likely to have been encouraging. Its mobile app has also been performing well for a while.Improved price realization and gains from share repurchases are likely to have been tailwinds. Recovery in its stores, owing to improved tourism and improved price realization, bodes well.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Carter's this time around.

(NASDAQ: ANSS), today reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth of 6% and 5% in reported currency, respectively, or 11% and 10% in constant currency, respectively, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

For the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $2.95 and $3.09 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, compared to $2.30 and $2.81 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2021.

Our focus on customer success, product leadership and execution drove double-digit constant currency ACV and revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year. Our excellent performance is evidence of the significant value that our best-in-class multiphysics product portfolio delivers to our customers as well as the immense opportunity that lies ahead of Ansys,” said Ajei Gopal, Ansys president and CEO. “Our customers continue to rely on Ansys simulation to drive innovation across their next-generation products. We recently released the latest version of our portfolio, which is helping users to bring smarter, more sustainable products to market faster and at lower costs.”Gopal further stated, “I am also proud to say that we achieved over $2.0 billion in ACV in 2022, which exceeds the 2022 ACV target outlined at our 2019 investor day. We did this despite a global pandemic, the war in Ukraine and trade sanctions, that made for a challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment with unprecedented foreign exchange headwinds. Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond, I am confident in our ability to continue to meet the 2025 goals we outlined in our investor update last August.”Nicole Anasenes, Ansys CFO, stated, “Q4 concluded another excellent year and demonstrated the strength and resilience of our business model against a backdrop of consistent customer demand for simulation and exceptional execution by the Ansys team. We exceeded our financial guidance across all key metrics for the quarter and the full year. With strong, consistent growth throughout 2022, ACV and non-GAAP revenue grew 14% and 13% in constant currency, respectively, on a full-year basis. In FY 2022, we saw broad-based growth across geographies, industries and customer types. We are entering 2023 with momentum and a robust pipeline and backlog, which gives us continued confidence in achieving our long-term outlook of 12% ACV CAGR and $3.0 billion of unlevered operating cash flow from 2022-2025.”   The non-GAAP financial results highlighted, and the non-GAAP financial outlook for 2023 discussed below, represent non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and for the 2023 financial outlook, can be found later in this release.   / Financial ResultsAnsys' fourth quarter and FY 2022 and 2021 financial results are presented below. The 2022 and 2021 non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022, stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items.GAAP and non-GAAP results are as follows: GAAP Non-GAAP(in millions, except per share data and percentages)Q4 QTD 2022 Q4 QTD 2021 % Change Q4 QTD 2022 Q4 QTD 2021 % ChangeRevenue$694.1  $655.7  6% $694.7  $661.4  5%Net income$257.9  $203.2  27% $270.4  $247.5  9%Diluted earnings per share$2.95  $2.30  28% $3.09  $2.81  10%Operating profit margin 37.5%  36.4%    48.0%  46.8%   GAAP Non-GAAP(in millions, except per share data and percentages)FY 2022 FY 2021 % Change FY 2022 FY 2021 % ChangeRevenue$2,065.6  $1,906.7  8% $2,072.9  $1,931.5  7%Net income$523.7  $454.6  15% $698.9  $649.3  8%Diluted earnings per share$5.99  $5.16  16% $7.99  $7.37  8%Operating profit margin 28.7%  26.9%    42.0%  41.4%  / Other Performance Metrics(in millions, except percentages)Q4 QTD 2022 Q4 QTD 2021 % Change % Change in Constant CurrencyACV$818.0 $755.4 8% 13%Operating cash flows$174.0 $101.7 71%  Unlevered operating cash flows$181.1 $103.6 75%  (in millions, except percentages)FY 2022 FY 2021 % Change % Change in Constant CurrencyACV$2,031.7 $1,870.7 9% 14%Operating cash flows$631.0 $549.5 15%  Unlevered operating cash flows$648.1 $558.5 16%  ACV is a key performance metric and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business. ACV is a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. Over the life of the contract, ACV equals the total value realized from a customer. ACV is not impacted by the timing of license revenue recognition. ACV is used by management in financial and operational decision-making and in setting sales targets used for compensation. ACV is not a replacement for, and should be viewed independently of, GAAP revenue and deferred revenue as ACV is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following:the annualized value of maintenance and subscription lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plusthe annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts.When we refer to the anniversary dates in the definition of ACV above, we are referencing the date of the beginning of the next twelve-month period in a contractually committed multi-year contract. If a contract is three years in duration, with a start date of July 1, 2022, the anniversary dates would be July 1, 2023 and July 1, 2024. We label these anniversary dates as they are contractually committed. While this contract would be up for renewal on July 1, 2025, our ACV performance metric does not assume any contract renewals.Example 1: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $100,000 subscription lease contract or a $100,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2023, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV for fiscal year 2022 with no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2023.Example 2: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $300,000 subscription lease contract or a $300,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2025, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV in each of fiscal years 2022, 2023 and 2024. There would be no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2025 as each period captures the full annual value upon the anniversary date.Example 3: A perpetual license valued at $200,000 with a contract start date of March 1, 2022 would contribute $200,000 to ACV in fiscal year 2022./ Management's 2023 Financial OutlookThe Company's first quarter and FY 2023 revenue, diluted earnings per share and ACV guidance is provided below. The Company is also providing its FY 2023 guidance for operating cash flows and unlevered operating cash flow. The revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance is provided on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022, stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items.This guidance is based on the Company's evaluation of factual information it has determined to be relevant and the application of certain assumptions made by the Company. Please refer to the Company's prepared remarks document for additional information regarding the Company's financial guidance, including its assumptions regarding overall business dynamics./ First Quarter 2023 Guidance The Company currently expects the following for the quarter ending March 31, 2023:(in millions, except percentages and per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$482.5 - $507.5 $482.5 - $507.5 Revenue Growth Rate13.5 % - 19.4 % 12.6 % - 18.4 % Revenue Growth Rate — Constant Currency15.7 % - 21.9 % 14.7 % - 20.9 %Diluted earnings per share$0.78 - $1.01 $1.53 - $1.71(in millions, except percentages)Other Financial MetricsACV$380.0 - $400.0 ACV Growth Rate10.4 % - 16.2 % ACV Growth Rate — Constant Currency12.4 % - 18.6 %/ Fiscal Year 2023 GuidanceThe Company currently expects the following for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023:(in millions, except percentages and per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$2,242.0 - $2,322.0 $2,242.0 - $2,322.0 Revenue Growth Rate8.5 % - 12.4 % 8.2 % - 12.0 % Revenue Growth Rate — Constant Currency7.2 % - 11.2 % 6.9 % - 10.8 %Diluted earnings per share$5.38 - $6.06 $8.34 - $8.86(in millions, except percentages)Other Financial MetricsACV$2,265.0 - $2,335.0 ACV Growth Rate11.5 % - 14.9 % ACV Growth Rate — Constant Currency9.9 % - 13.4 %Unlevered operating cash flows$710.0 - $760.0Operating cash flows$673.0 - $723.0Our diluted FY 2023 EPS guidance is inclusive of $44.1 million in interest expense ($36.4 million, net of tax). This compares to interest expense in FY 2022 of $22.7 million ($18.6 million, net of tax) with the significant increase in FY 2023 driven by the recent rising interest rate environment and our floating interest rate on our term loans. Because of the unpredictable nature of the interest rate environment, our go-forward guidance for operating cash flow will be on an unlevered basis. We will continue to provide a reconciliation to operating cash flow in our GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations. Reconciliations of the GAAP to Non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook and the operating cash flow to unlevered operating cash flow outlook are available in our ""Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures"" section found later in this document./ Conference Call InformationAnsys will hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on February 23, 2023 to discuss fourth quarter and FY 2022 results.

These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A detailed explanation of each of the adjustments to such financial measures is described below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.We use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue. Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives. Under prior accounting guidance, a fair value provision resulted in acquired deferred revenue that was often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that was lower than the historical carrying value. Although this fair value provision has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In 2022, we adopted accounting guidance which eliminates the fair value provision that resulted in the deferred revenue adjustment on a prospective basis. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment for acquisitions prior to the adoption of the new guidance in 2022. We believe that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related subscription leases and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.Stock-based compensation expense. We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Expenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, we have updated this non-GAAP measure to include, in addition to professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, other expenses directly related to business combinations, including compensation expenses and concurrent restructuring activities, such as employee severances and other exit costs. These costs are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses. The additional expenses were not material in the current or prior year period. We exclude these acquisition-related expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Non-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we re-evaluate and update this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.Unlevered operating cash flows. We make cash payments for the interest incurred in connection with our debt financing which are included in our GAAP presentation of operating cash flows. We exclude this cash paid for interest, net of the associated tax benefit, for the purpose of calculating unlevered operating cash flows. Unlevered operating cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP measure that we use to evaluate our core operating business. We believe this measure is useful to investors and management because it provides a measure of our cash generated through operating activities independent of the capital structure of the business.Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below:GAAP Reporting MeasureNon-GAAP Reporting MeasureRevenueNon-GAAP RevenueGross ProfitNon-GAAP Gross ProfitGross Profit MarginNon-GAAP Gross Profit MarginOperating IncomeNon-GAAP Operating IncomeOperating Profit MarginNon-GAAP Operating Profit MarginNet IncomeNon-GAAP Net IncomeDiluted Earnings Per ShareNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per ShareOperating Cash FlowsUnlevered Operating Cash FlowsConstant currency. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures detailed above, we use constant currency results for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2022 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2021 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2022. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2022 reported amounts by the 2022 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing the adjusted amounts to the 2021 comparable period reported amounts. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our reported results to our past reports of financial results without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations./ About AnsysWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality with Ansys simulation.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Pharmaceutical Stocks Now. The pharmaceutical industry was the center of attention in 2020 and 2021 after the deadly coronavirus pandemic ravaged the globe and disrupted the way of living. As countries played hide and seek with lockdowns, it was left to pharmaceuticals to come up with a cure for a disease that in the early stages of the pandemic had flooded hospitals and overwhelmed graveyards.Fast forward to 2023 and the pandemic is a thing of the past. Vaccines such as those from Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) are among some of the most advanced products in the world since they are capable of influencing cell function in the human body, making them perfect for developing long term immunity against the virus. The technology also reaped billions in dividends for the companies, particularly Moderna whose shares are up by a massive 826% over the past five years as the company which was a relatively unknown firm was transformed into a global household name.These days, the pharmaceutical industry is focusing on rising technologies such as artificial intelligence to crack the puzzle to defeat diseases such as cancer and thalassemia. Estimates made by the healthcare giant Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (OTCMKTS:BAYZF) show that the world's population is aging at a remarkable rate, with individuals aged 65 and above set to double to 1.5 billion by 2050. At the same time, the growth in noncommunicable and serious diseases, such as heart problems or cancer, is expected to grow at an equally fast rate, with China alone seeing such diseases to account for 80% of all deaths of people aged 60 or higher by 2030. Bayer goes on to estimate a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for the pharmaceutical industry, and keeping the aforementioned factors in mind, it believes that the sector can grow as fast as by 6% through 2025.Story continuesAnother research report, this time from Facts and Factors, has similar estimates for the market. It lays down a 5.7% CAGR for the industry from 2022 to 2028 and believes that the sector, which was worth $1.4 billion last year, will be worth $2 billion by the end of the forecast period. Like Bayer, Facts and Factors also believes that diseases such as cancer and diabetes will fuel this growth and that growth in the population of elderly people will result in a higher demand for pharmaceutical products.

195,c9d6a5c8-0a8a-3279-a240-b40dc1bf2bde,PYPL,2023-02-23,Time to Buy Alibaba (BABA) or Block (SQ) Stock with Earnings Approaching?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-alibaba-baba-block-221710884.html,1677104230,STORY,"['BABA', 'PYPL']","[This shortened week of trading will be highlighted by internet and technology services companies Alibaba (BABA) and Block’s (SQ) quarterly reports.Let’s see if it’s time for investors to gear up and buy these popular tech stocks with their earnings approaching.Alibaba (BABA) The reopening of China’s economy provided a strong catalyst for Chinese stocks, but more upside in Alibaba stock very much depends on its fiscal third-quarter report on Thursday, February 23.After impressive rallies, Chinese stocks including BABA have cooled off recently on concerns that pricing wars upon China’s reopening could dilute margins with Alibaba and E-Commerce rival JD.com (JD) perfect examples of this scenario.With that being said, Alibaba stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) heading into its quarterly release with earrings estimate revisions trending higher throughout the quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Preview &amp; OutlookAlibaba’s Q3 earnings are projected at $2.29 per share, down -13% from Q3 2022 EPS of $2.65 a share. However, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) indicates Alibaba could beat bottom-line expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q3 EPS at $2.52. On the top line, third-quarter sales are expected to be $35.36 billion, down -7% from the prior year quarter. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverall, Alibaba’s earnings are now forecasted to dip -12% to $7.31 a share for fiscal 2023 compared to EPS of $8.31 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to rebound and climb 14% to $8.37 per share. Sales are expected to be down -4% in FY23 but jump 12% in FY24 to $142.85 billion.Performance &amp; Valuation Alibaba stock is up +7% YTD to outperform competitor JD.com’s -17% and the S&amp;P 500’s +4% but trail the Nasdaq’s +10% and the Electric Commerce Markets +11%. Since Alibaba went public in 2014 its stock performance is virtually flat to underperform JD stock, the broader indexes, and its Zacks Subindustry’s +88%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, there have been some nice rallies in Alibaba stock in the past before the large decline among many tech stocks and the broader stock market in the last few years. This makes Alibaba’s Q3 report very important in regaining its footing as an industry leader and there could be plenty of upside ahead based on the company’s valuation.Trading at $94 per share, BABA stock trades at 15.7X forward earnings which is nicely below its industry average of 19.9X, JD’s 21.4X, and the S&amp;P 500’s 18.3X. Alibaba’s stock also trades 76% below its historical high of 66.6X and at a 57% discount to the median of 36.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBlock (SQ)  Another stock that will receive a considerable amount of attention when it reports its fourth-quarter earnings on February 23 is Block (SQ). The technology services company currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) going into its quarterly release and more upside in SQ stock will also cringe on its earnings and the company’s guidance.Like fellow online payment solutions provider PayPal (PYPL) among other tech stocks, these equities fell mightily in 2022 amid higher inflation but had nice rallies to start the new year.While Block rivals PayPal as an online payment solutions provider through Square and Cash App, the company has a diverse business model that extends to other financial and marketing services such as cryptocurrency trading, point of sale (POS) transactions, and online banking products.Q4 Preview &amp; OutlookThe Zacks Consensus for Blocks Q4 earnings is $0.30 per share, which would be an 11% increase from Q4 2021. However, the Zacks Surprise Prediction indicates Block could significantly miss earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.18 a share. Sales for the quarter are expected to be $4.53 billion, up 11% from the prior year quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRounding out its fiscal year 2022, Blocks earnings are now forecasted to drop -38% to $1.06 a share compared to EPS of $1.71 in 2021. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rebound 61% back to $1.71 per share. Earnings estimate revisions have remained unchanged for FY22 throughout the quarter and are slightly higher for FY23. Sales are now projected to be down -1% for FY22 but rise 9% in FY23 to $19.10 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; ValuationBlock stock is up +16% YTD to outperform PayPal’s +6%, the Technology Services Markets’ +11%, and the broader indexes. Even better, since Block went public in 2015 its stock is now up an impressive +467% to also outperform PayPal and the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $72 a share, Block’s stock trades at roughly 42.1X forward earnings which is much higher than the industry average of 21.7X. With that being said, Block does trade well below its extreme historical high and the median of 551.8X.TakeawayAlibaba (BABA) and Block’s (SQ) valuations are attractive relative to their past but the rising earnings estimate revisions for both its FY23 and FY24 make BABA stock more intriguing at the moment. In correlation Alibaba stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Block lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Still, much of the upside for both stocks will hinge on their quarterly reports and Wall Street will be paying special attention to each company’s guidance and outlook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is one of the most popular ETFs in the United States and has become a mainstay in many investors’ portfolios. This is due to the fund's long track record of strong performance. Over the past decade, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 nine out of ten times.Overall, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is a great option for risk averse investors looking to gain exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index. It is a low-cost, liquid, and diversified ETF that has consistently provided strong returns over time. However, for investors that have a higher risk tolerance, investing in individual QQQ stocks can lead to potentially higher returns.Investing in stocks that make up the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) can provide investors with the opportunity to benefit from individual company performance without the risk of being exposed to the broader market.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail.Most Promising QQQ Stocks According to Hedge FundsOur MethodologyWe sifted through holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) and sourced the hedge fund sentiment for each stock from Insider Monkey's database.

Finally, we ranked our picks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have positions in them. Along with each stock, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment, analyst ratings, and top shareholders.Most Promising QQQ Stocks According to Hedge Funds15. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) is a leading cybersecurity company that provides various information security services for enterprise, cloud, and government sectors. The company provides endpoint protection, cloud security, network security, and advanced threat prevention among others. As of February 21, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) has gained 20.54% year to date.On February 21, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $1.05 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.27. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.66 billion, up 25.68% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $5.54 million.This February, Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges started coverage of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) with a Buy rating and a $205 price target.At the close of Q4 2022, 85 hedge funds were long Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) and disclosed positions worth $3.27 billion in the company. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the largest investor and held a stake worth $363.7 million. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) is one of the most promising QQQ stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection within the IT sector was the main detractor from relative performance during the period. In addition to rate hikes compressing the multiples of longerduration, high growth companies, recession concerns were also a headwind. IT companies which had proven resilient against customer budget reductions earlier in the year are starting to feel the impact of spending slowdowns as companies further scrutinize expenses in light of economic uncertainty. For example, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), which provides enterprise security solutions including next-generation firewalls and threat detection software, faced a challenging environment as customers delayed purchases and orders. However, we remain convinced of the company’s long-term growth prospects as an industry leader in a critical field and as digital attacks and ransomware continue to grow.”14. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the most promising QQQ stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was spotted on 91 investors' portfolios that disclosed positions worth $5.93 billion in the company.This February, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan reiterated his $150 price target and an Equal Weight rating on Tesla, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“Even as rates rose and the macro environment devolved, we believed Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was best positioned to grow and thrive, even through a period of extreme uncertainty. They are the market leader in rapidly growing end markets and have spent the past decade growing their competitive advantages and building out physical infrastructure with worldwide reach. While we believe we were right regarding the direction of fundamentals, this was overcome by a vast array of factors we didn’t anticipate that negatively impacted the price.By and large, Tesla had amazing execution in 2022. They managed to achieve 40% YOY delivery growth. In addition, revenue growth should exceed 50% and profit growth should exceed 120% YOY once Q4 numbers are released. This was accomplished while navigating a myriad of difficulties including a prolonged shutdown at their most productive plant in Shanghai. They scaled two factories on different continents while maintaining industry-leading margins and continued to make advanced progress in transformational technologies that have fast future cash flow potential like AI, software, and manufacturing. Through all the noise a lot of remarkable progress was made…” (Click here to read the full text)13. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American software company specializing in business and financial management software. On January 4, KeyBanc analyst Josh Beck raised his price target on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) to $425 from $400 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) was held by 92 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022. These funds held collective positions worth $5.62 billion in the company, up from $5.11 billion in the preceding quarter with 86 positions. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive and the stock is one of the most promising QQQ stocks according to hedge funds.As of December 31, Durable Capital Partners is the most prominent shareholder in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and has a position worth $681.6 million in the company.Here is what Fundsmith had to say about Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its 2022 yearly investor letter:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow. ..” (Click here to read the full text)12. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 94On February 1, T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

(NASDAQ:TMUS) and held collective stakes worth $3.71 billion in the company. Of those, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in the company and has disclosed a position worth $733.8 million.11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is ranked eleventh among the most promising QQQ stocks according to hedge funds. At the end of Q4 2022, 97 hedge funds held stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The total value of these stakes amounted to $5.70 billion.

(NASDAQ:AMD) to $103 from $93 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares.As of December 31, Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and has a position worth $424.7 million.Here is what L1 Capital International had to say about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The share price of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was weak during the quarter and weakened further in early October when the pre-announced revenue was significantly below prior guidance, reflecting an acute slowdown in the PC market. Data centre related revenue grew strongly, albeit below our expectations, while gaming and embedded revenue was in line with our base case.Geopolitical risks have increased for the semiconductor sector, with the U.S. Government announcing restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. Despite near term headwinds, AMD is well positioned for the medium term, with a technology lead over Intel in servers for data centres and rapidly gaining share in the PC/notebook sectors. Its gaming and embedded applications continue to grow strongly. AMD is a very capital light business, with manufacturing outsourced. After expending nearly $5b on research and development, AMD generates around $5b of free cashflow. With a net cash balance sheet, we expect management will accelerate buyback activity at a share price well below fair value.The share price of our more cyclical businesses, in particularly the building products companies which have exposure to the U.S. residential, repair and renovation and infrastructure sectors, were broadly flat for the quarter. Rapidly escalating mortgage rates and rapidly reducing affordability will have a pronounced negative effect on near term new residential construction activity. We believe these cyclical pressures are well understood and are more than reflected in current share prices. Overall, we strongly believe share prices are overly reflecting near-term challenges and our portfolio of companies are now meaningfully undervalued.”10. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Wall Street sees upside to Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). On February 15, UBS analyst Karl Keirstead raised his price target on Adobe Inc.

Since our initial purchase in 2013, NVDA has seen its stock decline 50% one other time, back in 2018. The best-performing businesses and stocks do not go up and to the right. Mr. Market gets moody, and even one of the highest quality companies in the world is not immune. Drawdowns of this magnitude are challenging to stomach, even though the stock is up 50x in less than ten years. While we consider ourselves old school value investors, we continue to hold this fantastic company even though, optically, it does not appear cheap. Our confidence in Jensen remains, and while gaming is no longer in hyper-growth mode, the Data Center segment continues to grow. AI, Automotive, and other small but rapidly growing industries are the next leg of the story. Chris Mayer discusses the position in greater detail with commentary from our CIO, Peter O’Keefe.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) suffered with the slowdown in e-commerce, yet still will have outgrown e-commerce when we see final 2022 numbers. Much like Amazon, PayPal invested far too aggressively on the expectation of sustained elevated growth rates in e-commerce and unfortunately, unlike with Amazon, PayPal’s investment was on ancillary product excursions from which the company is already retrenching. The good news is that with this retrenchment, the company should once again return to its recipe of healthy top line growth and incremental margin leverage, but rather than grow back into their old margin structure they will have to cost-cut their way there.”7.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines International Business Machines Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the CFO and Senior VP of Finance &amp; Operations, James Kavanaugh, for US$5.2m worth of shares, at about US$134 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$131. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.All up, insiders sold more shares in International Business Machines than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.International Business Machines Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at International Business Machines. Specifically, CFO and Senior VP of Finance &amp; Operations James Kavanaugh ditched US$5.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes International Business Machines Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that International Business Machines insiders own 0.09% of the company, worth about US$108m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The International Business Machines Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold International Business Machines shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

High oil prices have been the major catalyst pushing energy stocks higher, and there are several factors keeping prices elevated. Inflation, and the increased cost of labor and goods.The Russian - Ukrainian war has raised uncertainty in the European energy market and created trade bans with Russia thus tightening oil supply.Structural shortages of oil production due to underinvestment in energy infrastructure.There are several oil and gas stocks with upward trending earnings revisions giving them high Zacks Ranks scores. Furthermore, according to the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas – Refining and Marketing is in the top 5% (12 out of 251) of industries.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero EnergyValero Energy VLO is a deeply diversified oil refinery company with 15 plants across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean and capacity to refine 3.2 million barrels a day. The majority of VLO’s refinery plants are located in the Gulf Coast with easy access to export facilities, boosting margins. Valero recently reported strong fourth-quarter results with a 13% upside surprise on EPS.VLO has been a top performing stock over the past year, trouncing the returns of the broad market and more than doubling returns of its respective sector. Even after the price of oil peaked back in March 2022, VLO stock is still pushing near its all-time highs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBecause of its strong performance and prospects VLO currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. In the table below, you can estimates across time frames dipped significantly between 90 and 30 days ago. But the estimates have been revised dramatically higher over the last 30 days.Current quarter earnings estimates are projected to jump nearly 200% YoY to $6.90 per share.VLO also has encouraging Zacks Style Scores, earning an A for Value, B for Growth, and A for Momentum.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero Energy currently trades at a one-year forward P/E of 6x, well below its 10-year median of 10x, and in line with the industry's average. Additionally, VLO offers a dividend yield of 3.1%. We can see that although the path of dividend increases has been volatile, it has been increasing over the last two decades.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon PetroleumMarathon Petroleum MPC, is a U.S. based integrated, downstream energy company. MPC operates through two segments, Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation. Refining and Marketing operates 16 refineries with a crude processing capacity of 3 million barrels per day. In 2022 the refining business recorded $16.5 billion in profits. Pipeline transportation, operating as a partnership with Andeavor Logistics transports oil products and manages logistics. It earned $4.5 billion in profits in 2022.Additionally, in 2021, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway retail gasoline business for $21 billion to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; I Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.MPC currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating that earnings expectations are being revised higher. In the chart below we can see that both 2023 and 2024 expectations are clearly trending higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike VLO, MPS has seen the majority of positive revisions happen over the last 30 days. All projections have been revised significantly higher, besides next quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon Petroleum is currently trading at 7x one-year forward P/E, which is below its 5-year median of 9x, and just above the industry average 6x. MPC also offers a dividend yield of 2.5%. And MPC has consistently raised its payout, raising its dividends/share from $0.60 per share in 2012, to $2.50 per share today.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPhillips 66Phillips 66 PSX is an oil and gas midstream, chemicals, refining and marketing company. Refining is the primary contributor to the top line, and PSX operates 13 refineries across the U.S. and Europe. Midstream businesses, which focus on transportation and storage of petroleum have been flourishing of late. Considering the lack of energy infrastructure that has taken place over the last decade, many investors have become keen on the sector.PSX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Additionally, the stock earns an A grade across Zacks Style Scores Value, Growth and Momentum. Current quarter sales estimates are projecting a YoY decrease of -4.5% to $35 billion, but earnings are still expected to grow. Current quarter EPS of $3.86 per share would mark a 193% YoY increase.PSX also boasts a very reasonable valuation. The stock is currently trading at a one-year forward P/E of 7x, below its 10-year median of 12x, and just above the industry average of 6x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPSX is also a great dividend stock with a current yield of 4.2%, and a long history of raising dividend payments.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionWe covered what is pushing oil prices higher, but whether these issues will persist is of course unknown. For the time being all these factors are still at play though. A major sell-off in oil prices, or a slowdown in economic output would be a thorn in the bullish energy thesis.Oil and gas stocks have made an epic comeback since the 2020 pandemic era. Oil futures at one point during the depths of Covid traded -$16. It was also a popular narrative that the world would soon be running off entirely alternative energy sources and driving electric cars. While that may be true eventually, oil, gas and other fossil fuels are still the primary sources of energy for the world.Furthermore, as seen in this report, oil and gas companies make for great stocks, with strong business models, reasonable valuations, and generous dividends. Because of these traits, energy stocks make for a great addition to any investor’s portfolio. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While some parts of its territories experienced warm and dry weather conditions, other parts experienced normal precipitation levels accompanied by snowfall. Such a mixed weather pattern can be expected to have a moderate impact on the company’s overall revenues in the fourth quarter.Strong LNG sales and strength in new businesses, coupled with increased ownership in AES Andes, are likely to have benefitted overall revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022.However, some parts of its service territories witnessed 20 wildfire activities in November. Meanwhile, in December, strong wind gusts affected some of its service areas, which might have led to power outages for its customers. These, along with the aftereffects of Hurricane Nicole, might have partially dampened AES’ fourth-quarter top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.88 billion. This suggests an increase of 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.Strong sales, coupled with strength in margins in Brazil and AES Andes, may have continued to boost its overall margins, thus aiding its bottom line in the fourth quarter. Additionally, new tax credits, buoyed by the Inflation Reduction Act, may have added impetus to its fourth-quarter bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 46 cents per share. This indicates growth of 2.2% from the prior-year reported figure.The AES Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe AES Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe AES Corporation price-eps-surprise | The AES Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AES this time.

203,214cfacf-9bcd-374a-81b0-3183e549d796,GM,2023-02-23,Lithium Americas Receives Letter of Substantial Completion for Application to U.S. DOE ATVM Loan Program,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-americas-receives-letter-substantial-235200476.html,1677109920,STORY,"['GM', 'LAC']","[Lithium AmericasVANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 22, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (“Lithium Americas” or the “Company”) received a Letter of Substantial Completion from the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) Loan Programs Office for its application to support the financing of its Thacker Pass lithium project (“Thacker Pass” or the “Project”) in Humboldt County, Nevada. The Letter of Substantial Completion determines that the Company’s application for the DOE’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (“ATVM Loan Program”) contains all the information necessary to conduct an eligibility assessment and can commence the process to engage in confirmatory due diligence and term sheet negotiation.“We applaud the Biden Administration for their efforts to date and support to secure a domestic supply chain of critical minerals to strengthen our national security, our economy and our commitment to sustainability,” said Jonathan Evans, President and CEO. “We are pleased to have the support of both GM and the DOE to accelerate the energy transition while spurring job creation and economic growth in America. Over the past months, we have achieved major milestones that allow us to commence construction and begin ordering long-lead equipment at Thacker Pass, putting into motion a solid foundation for a domestic lithium supply chain for electric vehicles.”The Letter of Substantial Completion follows the Company’s April 2022 application for the DOE ATVM Loan Program. If the Company is offered a loan by DOE, it expects funding from the ATVM Loan Program to provide up to 75% of Thacker Pass’ total capital costs for construction. Relevant development costs incurred by the Project may qualify as eligible costs under the ATVM Loan Program as of January 31, 2023. DOE’s invitation to enter into due diligence is not an assurance that DOE will offer a term sheet to the applicant, or that the terms and conditions of a term sheet will be consistent with terms proposed by the applicant. The foregoing matters are wholly dependent on the results of DOE advanced due diligence and DOE’s determination whether to proceed.Story continuesThacker Pass is the largest known lithium resource in the U.S., targeting total production capacity of 80,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) of battery-quality lithium carbonate to be developed in two phases of 40,000 tpa, respectively (“Phase 1” and “Phase 2”). Phase 1 production is expected to commence in the second half of 2026. The Project is expected to create 1,000 construction jobs and 500 operations jobs and support the production of up to one million electric vehicles per year.In January 2023, Lithium Americas entered into a binding supply agreement with General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) (“GM”) where GM will receive exclusive access to Phase 1 production for 10 years from the commencement of Phase 1 production, with the option for GM to extend by an additional five years under the same terms as the initial term. GM will also have a right of first offer on the offtake of Thacker Pass’ Phase 2 production. Lithium carbonate from Thacker Pass will be used in GM’s proprietary Ultium battery cells. In connection with the supply agreement, GM agreed to a strategic investment of $650 million of equity in two tranches. The initial $320 million investment tranche closed on February 16, 2023, and the company expects the second $330 million investment tranche to close following the Company's contemplated separation of its U.S. and Argentine businesses in the second half of 2023 and the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent to such closing.With the expected funding from the ATVM Loan Program, in combination with GM’s $650 million equity investment and cash on hand, Lithium Americas expects to have secured the necessary funding to substantially de-risk Thacker Pass Phase 1 construction.Further information can be found in the technical report titled “Feasibility Study, National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Thacker Pass Project Humboldt County, Nevada, USA” with an effective date of November 2, 2022 filed on SEDAR under the Company’s profile on January 31, 2023. All figures presented are in U.S. Dollars.ABOUT LITHIUM AMERICASLithium Americas is focused on advancing lithium projects in Argentina and the United States to production. In Argentina, Caucharí-Olaroz is advancing towards first production and Pastos Grandes represents regional growth. In the U.S., Thacker Pass expects to commence construction imminently. The Company trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol “LAC”.For further information contact:Investor RelationsTelephone: 778-656-5820Email: ir@lithiumamericas.comWebsite: www.lithiumamericas.comFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThis news release contains certain forward-looking information, including information with respect to accessing funding from the ATVM Loan Program.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +13.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has gained 36.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.24 points to a change of -17.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +11.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.99 indicates a change of -4% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +15.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $38.54 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $161.68 billion and $162.46 billion estimates indicate +3.2% and +0.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $43.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.19%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Feb 21 (Reuters) -Cholula maker McCormick &amp; Company Inc is looking to hike prices on its spices and hot sauces but is getting ""pushback"" on the increases, CEO Lawrence Kurzius said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.Kurzius, speaking on the sidelines of the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference, said the ""pushback on this is in line with the pushback (on) the last round"" of price hikes the Frank's RedHot sauce maker introduced last year.Retailers including Walmart, the world's largest, have said that they are concerned about further price increases from consumer products companies, after largely passing them on following once-in-a-generation levels of inflation.Walmart is among McCormick's biggest customers, according to the spice maker's financial reports, and the company's products are sold at major grocery chains including U.S.-based Kroger Co and U.K.-based Tesco PLC.Kurzius said he would not talk about specific customers.""Everyone is frustrated with costs going up and so are we,"" Kurzius said, adding that McCormick's conversations with its customers on the price increases have a ""certain amount of commercial tension associated with them.""""We like most companies are going to pass it through because it's really cost based, and (retailers) see it in their own costs as well,"" Kurzius said, adding that he was ""confident"" that McCormick would ultimately win approval on the increases.McCormick is revamping its packaging to help its signature spices stay fresher longer, an upgrade that can make the hikes more palatable, he added.Kurzius said that retailers are looking for promotions from consumer products makers, but the discounts companies like McCormick can offer are not making up for price increases.""Promotional activity is to drive volume and consumer demand,"" he said.Consumer products companies had slashed promotions and discounts during and immediately after the pandemic because they did not have enough supply, but McCormick reactivated them last year, Kurzius said.A 23-ounce bottle of Frank's Red Hot costs about $5.38 on Walmart.com.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc in FocusThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is headquartered in Pittsburgh, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -1.56% since the start of the year. The company is paying out a dividend of $1.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.86% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.1% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.61%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6 is up 4.3% from last year. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 13.08%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc's payout ratio is 43%, which means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, PNC expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $14.75 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 5.66%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, PNC is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Despite that growth, minority-business ownership represents only 18 percent of total U.S. businesses, and the businesses face huge disparities when it comes to access to capital, contracting opportunities and other entrepreneurial development.1""Small businesses are the fabric of our communities, and it's our privilege to help and support them."" says Marshalynn Odneal, PNC's national sales executive for minority business. ""Through this work, we hope to become a true partner to minority business owners and arm them with the tools and support they need to be successful.""Watch More Conversations About Minority-Owned Small Business and EntrepreneurshipBuilding a Winning Team of Partners: Insights for Black-Owned BusinessesPNC Presents Minority-Owned Businesses: Overcoming Financial ChallengesHBCUs: Catalysts for Economic EmpowermentDeepening Community RelationshipsLed by Odneal, the Minority Business Development Group offers business owners the expertise of dedicated bankers, advocacy partners and technology designed to empower, educate and accelerate entrepreneurial success. She and her team of bankers will work in close collaboration with PNC's Community Development Banking team, the Corporate Responsibility Group, as well as the bank's regional presidents across the country.""By making this investment, we are further reinforcing our local market commitment to small businesses, and in particular ensuring we are doing all that we can to help minority-owned businesses succeed and grow,"" says Marc McAndrew, head of Small Business at PNC. ""Marshalynn has dedicated her career to being an advocate and champion, so I'm excited to see her leadership help the team bring this commitment to life in communities across the country.""Story continuesOdneal believes helping minority-owned businesses goes beyond reaching out to business owners. She says it will take establishing and deepening relationships and strategic alliances with external organizations that support business development and offer technical support to foster business growth opportunities.""When I think about the role of the Minority Business Development Officer (MBDO), it's no different than a core business banker. They need to have that credit acumen, but they also need the ability to communicate effectively internally and externally while networking with nonprofit and community leaders,"" Odneal says. ""The MBDO is really someone who loves to operate outside of the four walls of their office. They need to feel the pulse of the communities we serve.""A portion of the bank's $88 billion Community Benefits Plan will support the Minority Business Development Group's work to bolster economic opportunity. PNC plans to originate at least $26.5 billion in loans to small, low- to moderate-income, minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses through 2025.""PNC's Community Benefits Plan will have a direct impact on the work we're able to do in these communities, including our ability to leverage and expand upon alternative lending options through external partners for Black and Brown business owners in low-and moderate-income communities,"" Odneal says.Tools to Make a DifferenceUnder the new group, PNC also launched its Certified Minority Business Advocate program, a voluntary advocacy training program available to all PNC employees interested in providing enhanced support for minority business decision-makers. The new certificate program focuses on helping PNC employees understand the distinct challenges facing diverse businesses.The certified advocates will serve as PNC ambassadors within their communities and strengthen community engagement through volunteerism, mentorship and technical support. They also will be empowered to educate and guide these business owners toward valuable community resources.""In a perfect world, there would be no need for the Minority Business Group. But because we're working to solve known disparities among minority-owned firms, we know that we have to be intentional about providing the tools necessary to help these businesses thrive,"" Odneal says. ""It takes me back to our brand purpose, which is to help all move forward financially.""The PNC Financial Services Group, Wednesday, February 22, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/740345/PNC-Group-Focuses-on-Helping-Minority-Businesses-Thrive]"

214,7972129b-e84f-3f7b-8273-dd8b47338bf4,PNW,2023-02-23,Earnings Preview: Vistra Corp. (VST) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-vistra-corp-vst-150003326.html,1677078003,STORY,"['VST', 'PNW']","[Vistra Corp. (VST) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -86.9%.Revenues are expected to be $4.9 billion, up 47.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 197.78% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vistra Corp.For Vistra Corp.The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vistra Corp. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Vistra Corp. Would post earnings of $1.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering a surprise of -13.71%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Vistra Corp. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Pinnacle West (PNW), is soon expected to post loss of $0.18 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -175%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $841.12 million, up 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Pinnacle West has been revised 54.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -14.55%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pinnacle West will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We've got Target, Warner Brothers-Discovery, and Wingstop. Kicking it off with Target, the big box retailer saying that it is investing more in its e-commerce business to speed up delivery time.So the retail giant spending $100 million to build a larger network of supply chain hubs. They're calling them sortation centers here after testing the concept in a couple of cities. Now it currently has nine of these centers with plans to open more and also create hundreds of jobs over the next several years.Now, the centers could potentially help Target boost its online sales, which have slowed in recent quarters, by ensuring faster delivery for its customers. E-commerce sales increased by less than 1% in its third quarter. That's the most recent results.We're getting earnings from Target next week. But that's actually down from 29% growth at the prior year. Allie, the competition is very stiff in the retail sector overall. Obviously, among the big box retailers, they're going up in many situations against Walmart, against Amazon, which you could, I think, make a pretty strong argument that they have much shorter delivery times.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Right. And at the end of the day, what do consumers want? They want to get their delivery as fast as possible. And they don't want to pay high delivery fees. So that seems to be what these-- this sortation center project is going to focus on.And I mean, let's admit it. Amazon is a behemoth in this space. So why not try and beat them at their own game? Of course, Target has been going through a bit of a rough patch. They cut their outlook for the holiday quarter. They said they were looking to $3 billion worth of cost over the next three years.Story continuesWe'll see what those earnings results-- what story that tells next week. But I think what's interesting is I've noticed on TikTok and social media, people have branded Target as this luxury experience. You go in. You take your Starbucks.DAVE BRIGGS: Do tell.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, I've noticed that trend--SEANA SMITH: I like it.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --on social media.SEANA SMITH: When I go to Target, it's nice.ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's what people say. You go in for one thing, you leave with 50. And I wonder--DAVE BRIGGS: Well, that I know, but the luxurious part of that--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, yeah, if you see a TikTokSEANA SMITH: They have higher-end things than, I think, some of its competitors. I would definitely--ALEXANDRA CANAL: ""Tarjay,"" I mean, come on. So I wonder if there's a play there for Target moving forward, maybe partnering with some TikTok or social media influencers. I don't know.DAVE BRIGGS: I don't spend a lot of time on TikTok.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I could be the CMO.DAVE BRIGGS: --to learn. Oh, I think it's interesting. E-commerce sales, we learned a lot with Walmart. They were a 12% increase there at Walmart, far exceeding same-store sales. Sam's Club up 21% in e-commerce.And something Seana and I talked about earlier, Allie, which is surprising, is you talk about their competitors, Walmart and Amazon. Well, they do subscription services. And Target has stayed out of that.Well, they did have one. It started in 2014, and they canceled it in 2020. That's the game that you can't help but wonder if they want a Mulligan there and to get back in. That's where everyone's going is to a subscription service with free shopping-- free shipping and some deals also.SEANA SMITH: And then you also get that recurring revenue. It's so much easier for shoppers. And given that tough competitive landscape, you would think-- I think Target should definitely do that. That would be my--DAVE BRIGGS: Seems to be limited downside in getting in that game.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, potential value play there potentially too.]"

They asked to be anonymous because the information is not yet public.Those problems included repeated outages at its Prelude liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility off the western coast of Australia and a major malfunction at its Pernis refinery in the Netherlands, Europe's largest, when supplies were strained in the initial aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.Sawan announced the role of chief of staff and corporate relations in an internal memo last week, the sources said. The decision has not been previously reported.A Shell spokesperson confirmed the role has been created, without adding details.The chief of staff will not be a permanent member of Shell's executive committee, where major decisions are discussed, but will be able to take part in its meetings, the sources said.The person named to the job will be made public at the end of March, along with senior appointments that will take effect on July 1, the sources said.Leading candidates to the role include Katie Jackson, head of acquisitions and divestments, Richard Tallant, managing director of Qatar Shell and Australia country chair Tony Nunan, two of the sources said.Story continuesSawan has said he will improve Shell's performance and efficiency as it attempts to shift towards low-carbon energy and cut greenhouse emissions in the coming decades.""With fewer roles and greater accountability, simplifying decision-making, by building on our strength and focusing on performance and simplification, we intend to deliver compelling shareholder returns,"" Sawan said after Shell reported earlier this month record profits of $40 billion in 2022.Shell plans to keep its capital spending largely unchanged at around $25 billion in 2023, but operating costs are set to rise as the costs of services increase, inflation stays high and recent acquisitions are integrated.Sawan announced at the end of January a major change to Shell's structure, combining Shell's oil and gas production and liquefied natural gas (LNG) divisions under current Upstream Director Zoe Yujnovich. Renewable energy operations will come under oil refining and marketing operations led by current Downstream Director Huibert Vigeveno.Shell last underwent a major overhaul at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when then-CEO Ben van Beurden cut more than 10% of the company's workforce as part of his push to steer the company towards energy transition.Wael will officially announce Shell's long-term strategy in June.

You can skip our detailed discussion on dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best March Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend-paying companies have historically been a popular choice for income-seeking investors. These stocks have provided higher returns to shareholders along with a growing stream of income. In 2022, dividend stocks recorded their best performance, with companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributing over $561 billion worth of dividends to shareholders, up from $511.2 billion in 2021, as reported by Wall Street Journal. Analysts expect the figure to grow this year as well, as companies are steadily raising their payouts.Dividend stocks are often considered good investments during inflationary periods. A Fidelity’s report highlighted the performance of dividends in the 1940s and the 1970s when inflation was at its highest. During these decades, dividends represented 65% and 71% of the S&amp;P 500’s total return, respectively.Over the years, growth in dividend stocks has outpaced inflation. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, dividends have grown by an average of 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, compared with a 3.68% growth in inflation. The report further mentioned that dividends and reinvested dividends represented nearly 69% of the US stock market’s return since 1978. In this regard, dividend growers like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are particularly popular among investors.When investing in dividend stocks, investors often purchase stocks before the company’s ex-dividend date. Through this, investors seek to capture the dividend payout while eliminating exposure to the stock’s price movements. This strategy also allows them to potentially generate a higher yield than by simply holding a stock for the long term. To know more about this, readers can also have a look at Dividend Capture Strategy: 10 High-Yield Stocks to Buy in February, which discussed the dividend capture strategy in detail.

They have jumped more than 60% since the turn of the year, nearly three times the gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.The company got its start in the graphics chip business for PCs by helping video games look more realistic, and then rode the cryptocurrency wave as its chips were used for mining. Now, the next push comes from generative AI.Nvidia's surge Thursday has boosted its market value by more than $70 billion. That brings it to more than $580 billion, about five times that of Intel. It is the seventh-largest publicly traded U.S. firm.The key to the company's success is that it controls about 80% of the market for graphic processing units (GPUs), which are specialized chips that provide the kind of computing power required for services such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI's wildly popular ChatGPT chatbot.SPECIALIZED CHIPSGraphics processing units are designed to handle the specific kind of math involved in AI computing very efficiently, while generic central processing units (CPUs) from Intel can handle a broader range of computing tasks with less efficiency.AI is taking over the tech industry and, according to research firm Gartner, the share of specialized chips such as GPUs that are used in data centers is expected to rise to more than 15% by 2026 from less than 3% in 2020.Story continuesAdvanced Micro Devices, whose shares also rose after Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, is the second-biggest player in the GPU industry, with a market share of roughly 20%.""The two companies that are leading the AI revolution on the hardware and processing side are Nvidia and AMD and, in our opinion, these two companies are head and shoulders above everybody else,"" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar said.Lisa Su-led AMD has made big investments in AI in recent years, including a series of chips designed to compete with Nvidia's fastest offerings. Intel holds a less than 1% share of the space.A look at revenue growth expected from chips used for AI work.""The enthusiasm around ChatGPT and the potential use case it unlocks likely represents an inflection point in adoption of AI,"" said Lei Qiu, a technology fund portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, which has a 0.54% stake in Nvidia.""While it is hard to pinpoint exactly how big AI is today as a percent of (Nvidia's) revenue, it has the potential to grow exponentially as large tech companies race to develop similar types of AI applications,"" Qiu said.Nvidia's strength in the AI industry has also attracted the attention of venture capitalists and startups, which are investing billions of dollars and promising improvements such as lower electricity consumption.None of them have so far made a big dent in Nvidia's business.INTEL NO LONGER INSIDEAll of this is bad news for Intel, which is also shedding CPU market share to AMD in the data center and personal computer industries that it once dominated. The company now risks losing out on the next growth leg of the industry.It has in recent months made efforts to sharpen focus on GPUs including a move in December to split its graphic chips unit into two: one focused on personal computers and the other working on data center and AI.Still, analysts say the company has a long way to go before Intel can make a dent in the market.""Intel has more designs it has built to try and penetrate the (AI) market ... but to date it's seen a disappointing amount of traction despite its plethora of solutions,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Matthew Bryson said.(Reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Aditya Soni and Anil D'Silva)]"

In Europe, the STOXX index of leading European companies was 0.3% higher, consolidating its 8.8% gain for the year to nearly wiping out much of last year's 13% loss.Nearly all Fed policymakers backed further slowing the pace of rate hikes, minutes of the U.S. central bank's last policy meeting showed on Wednesday, but it also indicated that curbing unacceptably high inflation would be the ""key factor"" in how much further rates need to rise.""It feels like we hit a bit of turning point where we are hearing more hawkish sentiment and central banks may hike rates a little bit more than expected a few weeks ago,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, head of EMEA retail investments at Legal &amp; General Investment Management.""We've had data coming in stronger, so there is a risk that the momentum and enthusiasm is starting to wane in equity markets,"" Onuekwusi said.Euro zone data on Thursday showed inflation was marginally higher in January than previously estimated, but confirming that price growth is past its peak though the European Central Bank has already promised another 50-basis point hike in March.Story continuesEuro area bond yields headed back to multi-year highs in anticipation of further interest rate hikes.Bank of England rate setter Catherine Mann said the central bank should continue to raise borrowing costs, but her remarks had little impact on sterling.Ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street, Dow futures were up 0.3%, S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.5%. The second reading of fourth quarter gross domestic product and weekly jobless claims data are due.STOCK RALLY FIZZLESThe early-year rally in stocks has succumbed to a realisation that the Fed will continue to increase interest rates to cool the economy and tame inflation, analysts say.This has pushed safe-haven bond yields higher, making risky stocks less attractive, with the Fed's next meeting nearly a month away on March 22. The yield on 10-year Treasury was slightly firmer at 3.9254%.Eren Osman, managing director of wealth management at Arbuthnot Latham &amp; Co, said bond yields were starting to price in a higher terminal rate of 5.5% rather than 5.25% for the Fed.""From the minutes of the Fed, I take out of it a bonus that they appear to be more balanced in their inflation outlook, they recognise risks to the economy are skewed to the downside,"" Osman said.Markets were also bracing for a ""no landing"" scenario where global economic growth is resilient and inflation stays higher for longer, leading investors to dial back appetite for risk assets and government debt, analysts said.In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched its lowest level since Jan. 6 in early trade, but rose about 0.3% as the day wore on.The Bank of Korea also offered some relief by ending a year-long run of uninterrupted rate hikes with a pause, as expected.The Australian and New Zealand dollar were both slightly firmer against the dollar.The euro was little changed at $1.061.Crude oil futures lost more than $2 a barrel on Wednesday on expectations of more aggressive interest rate hikes. On Thursday Brent crude futures rose 1% to $81.42 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude advanced 1% to $74.70 a barrel.Wall Street indexes fell overnight and are eyeing their worst week of the year so far as stronger-than-forecast U.S. labour, inflation, retail sales and manufacturing figures have traders pricing interest rates staying higher for longer.Gold steadied at $1,827 an ounce.(Additional reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Susan Fenton)]"

Hawkish comments from policymakers have been interspersed with data pointing to a strong American economy.On Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, reflecting tight labor market conditions.A separate report confirmed the economy grew solidly in the fourth quarter, though rising inventory levels were responsible for much of the increase.U.S. gross domestic product increased 2.7% in the fourth quarter, according to the government's second estimate. Economists were forecasting a 2.9% rise.""If you're a bull, you can pull out plenty of things that are supportive, and if you're bear there are plenty of things to point to that are supportive,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.""There are so many cross currents that are moving in very different directions, I think it's very difficult to fall back on one or two things. That's creating a lot of hand-wringing uncertainty, and we're range-trading as a result of it.""For part of the day, the S&amp;P was trading below its 50-day moving average of 3,980 points, before rallying in the afternoon to finish above 4,000 points for the first time this week.Influencing this intraday dip were large trades in short-dated derivatives that piled selling pressure on the market, according to Nomura strategist Charlie McElligott.Helping provide confidence to buyers, Nvidia Corp posted positive earnings and surged 14% after forecasting quarterly sales above estimates and reporting a surge in the use of its chips to power artificial intelligence services.Story continuesOther chipmakers also gained, with Broadcom Inc, Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc rising between 0.6% and 1.8%. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index climbed 3.3%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 108.82 points, or 0.33%, to 33,153.91, the S&amp;P 500 gained 21.27 points, or 0.53%, to 4,012.32 and the Nasdaq Composite added 83.33 points, or 0.72%, to 11,590.40.Seven of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors rose. Higher crude prices pushed energy up 1.3%, and the index halted a losing run at seven. This tied its biggest stretch of declines since an eight-session skid in March 2017.Communication services was the biggest decliner, dropping 0.7%. This was its fifth straight fall, matching another five-loss streak in October. It was weighed by Netflix Inc, which slipped 3.4% on reports the streaming service was cutting subscription prices in 30 countries.Among other stocks, eBay Inc recorded its biggest daily drop since Sept. 13, sliding 5.2%, after warning of dour demand in the first half.Moderna Inc fell 6.7%, to its lower close since Nov. 3, after the vaccine maker reaffirmed its annual sales forecast of $5 billion for its COVID-19 vaccines despite its fourth-quarter sales exceeding estimates.However, Bumble Inc jumped 7.5%. The owner of the eponymous dating app projected annual revenue growth above market estimates on optimism over rising paying users.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.43 billion shares, compared with the 11.59 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.The S&amp;P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 128 new lows.(Reporting by Johann M Cherian and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru and David French in New York; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Arun Koyyur, Anil D'Silva and David Gregorio)]"

CRL reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.98 for fourth-quarter 2022, reflecting a 19.7% rise from the year-ago earnings. Nevertheless, the metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.4%.In the quarter, lower operating margins, increased interest expenses and a higher tax rate impacted the bottom line.On a GAAP basis, earnings increased 36.7% year over year to $3.65 per share.For the full year, adjusted EPS were $11.12 per share, up 7.8% from the year-ago period’s levels.

Organic revenue growth was driven by robust demand for research model services, particularly the Insourcing Solutions (IS) business, as well as higher revenue for small research models in North America and China.Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) revenues of $691.7 million rose 29.5% (up 26.5% organically). Organic revenue growth was mainly driven by broad-based growth in the Safety Assessment business on meaningful price increases and higher study volume.Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.

Quote Manufacturing Solutions revenues totaled $212.1 million, up 3.3% year over year (up 5.3% organically). Organic revenue growth was fueled by robust demand in the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses, partially offset by a revenue decline in the CDMO business.Story continuesMarginsThe gross profit in the reported quarter was $398.8 million, up 14.9% from the prior-year quarter. However, the gross margin of 36% contracted 209 basis points (bps) year over year on a 25.6% rise in the total costs of the company.Meanwhile, selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 38.5% to $199.6 million.Adjusted operating income totaled $199.2 million, reflecting a 1.9% drop from the prior-year quarter.

Organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 4.5-7.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $4.15 billion, indicating a 5.9% rise from 2022.Adjusted EPS for 2023 is expected in the range of $9.70-$10.90. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $11.37.Our TakeCharles River exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The results highlighted a more than 15% organic revenue growth, driven by strength across the DSA and Research Models and Services RMS business segments. The company registered robust demand in the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses.On the flip side, the contraction of both margins and escalating costs are concerning. Headwinds associated with foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and interest expense due to a rising interest rate environment increase concerns.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCharles River currently carries Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be $5 million.Our TakeExact Sciences exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The decline in quarterly loss compared to the year-ago period was encouraging. Robust revenues from the Screening and Precision Oncology segments contributed to the third-quarter top line. The company noted that more than 302,000 healthcare providers ordered Cologuard from its launch till the end of September. The growing uptake of the company’s Oncotype DX Breast and therapy selection products are major advantages.However, the decline in COVID-19 sales hampered top-line growth. The company incurred an operating loss in the quarter under review, raising apprehension.

The metric exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%.The fourth-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $215 million.In the fourth quarter, volume was driven by continued strong demand for Digestive Health products and improvements in Interventional Pain solutions.

Excluding Maxter and the negative impact of currency, sales grew almost 6% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $1.64.Per Avanos, excluding the expected impact of the product portfolio rationalization under the transformation plan, the company anticipates organic growth to be low single-digit.Our TakeAvanos exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The year-over-year improvement in the overall top and bottom lines was impressive. The strength exhibited by Avanos’ core Pain Management and Chronic Care segments was encouraging. The low single-digit growth in Acute Pain and mid-single-digit growth in Interventional Pain solutions are promising.The continued strong demand for Avanos’ products and solutions, as evidenced by the double-digit growth in Game Ready and COOLIEF sales during the quarter, also augur well. Strength in Digestive Health, with robust growth in NeoMed (fueled by strong execution of customer conversions to Avanos’ ENFit technology), was impressive. The expansion of both margins bodes well.Yet, the year-over-year decline in the Respiratory health business is disappointing. The continued supply headwinds, particularly within Avanos’ surgical pain category, and management’s expectations that these headwinds would remain a factor throughout the first part of 2023 raise our apprehension. Other issues like hospital staff shortages that have kept elective procedure levels at a lower level and inflation impacting Avanos’ business also raise our apprehension.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAvanos currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

We used $1.7 billion in cash for investing activities, primarily in connection with the acquisition of KDG, in addition to $340 million for capital expenditures. We also had $205 million in cash provided by financing activities, which includes $961 million of net proceeds from debt primarily related to the KDG acquisition.

We have quickly turned our attention to the year ahead and, while the macro-environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our strategic plans to drive sustained sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow. We believe our progress in these key areas, combined with a strong balance sheet, position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders,"" Mr. Donahue concluded.Non-GAAP InformationThis release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States (""U.S."") generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). These items include adjusted net income, adjusted diluted net income per common share and free cash flow. The company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted net income per common share and free cash flow, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the company's core operations. The company considers these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management's view and assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe these measures are useful and enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with the company's core operations. The company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure following the financial statements below.Comparable SalesComparable sales is a key metric that refers to period-over-period comparisons of our sales excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and other. The company considers this metric useful to investors because it provides greater transparency into management's view and assessment of the company's core ongoing operations. This is a metric that is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry, although our calculation of the metric may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies and analysts calculate this metric in the same manner.Conference CallGenuine Parts Company will hold a conference call today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss the results of the quarter.

The Indianapolis launch is made possible by global power leader Cummins Inc., through its Cummins Advocating for Racial Equity (CARE) initiative. We are all committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Moreover, we are committed to making a meaningful and lasting impact in the city of Indianapolis, IN.WHOStarted in 2019, The 15 White Coats (www.the15whitecoats.org) is an internationally recognized non-profit organization whose mission is to diversify medicine through mentorship, literacy accessibility, and economic assistance. The 15 White Coats started after a photo of 15 Tulane School of Medicine African-American medical students posing in front of plantation slave quarters went viral. The organization has helped over 2000 students with over $500,000 in scholarships to help with entering the healthcare field, whether they're physicians, dentists, PAs, optometrists, NPs, nurses, etc. Moreover, nearly 10,000 15 White Coats photos have been distributed to schools, students, institutions, and businesses worldwide.

Headquartered in Columbus, Indiana (U.S.), since its founding in 1919, Cummins employs approximately 73,600 people and is committed to powering a more prosperous world through three global corporate responsibility priorities critical to healthy communities: education, environment and equality of opportunity. Cummins has a deeply rooted history in fighting for social justice, serving its communities and living the company’s core values of diversity and inclusion.In October 2020, Cummins Inc. launched Cummins Advocating for Racial Equity (CARE) so Cummins could take a leading role in the work to dismantle systemic discrimination against the Black community in the U.S. As a first step in this journey, CARE brings together all Cummins' capabilities -- its people, its balance sheet and the company’s philanthropy -- to drive racial equity and combat the impact of racism on its people, communities, and economy.Through CARE, Cummins is taking decisive action to address and spearhead change throughout targeted CARE communities in the U.S., across four impact areas:Police reformCriminal justice reformEconomic empowermentSocial justice reformWith CARE’s efforts, Cummins is dedicated to improving communities in which it operates to have a direct impact on the lives of its employees and its neighbors.WHYAccording to Indiana’s National Assessment Educational Progress (NAEP), only 33% of fourth graders in Indiana read at or above a proficient level, with Black students among those suffering most. The NAEP results reflect the reality of educational inequities created by centuries of systemic racism that are still present today. How do we begin to engage and excite youth in the area of reading? High quality, culturally relevant books that can serve as mirrors and motivation to a historically left out population is a start. The Martindale-Brightwood neighborhood of Indianapolis has a scarcity of books in places where Black children are present and a lack of stories that positively reflect the youth within the communities.This partnership is created to provide children and families access to enjoyable books, powerful stories and meaningful community interaction that will cultivate a joy for reading, a healthy sense of self, fruitful lives and future aspirations. We will display boxes containing 15 curated books for K-3rd graders as designed by The 15 White Coats &amp; Black Worldschoolers Mobile Bookstore. Employees from the Cummins Community Involvement Team (CIT) along with volunteers within partnering organizations will deliver the three-tiered book boxes and read stories aloud to the children at site locations throughout the year. Locations in the Martindale-Brightwood community as identified by the Edna Martin Christian Center, Kipp Indy, and other local partners.Moreover, the partnership will host a literacy event in collaboration with Kipp Indy Schools in Spring 2023 to bring in the Mobile Bookstore and National Book Award Finalist, author Derrick Barnes.Resilient Readers Book Club is a book gifting initiative for school age children, created by the nationally renowned The 15 White Coats and Black Worldschoolers Mobile Bookstore, providing access to culturally relevant literature to inspire the youth of tomorrow.WHENThe Indianapolis area launch will take place March 6th, 3 pm-6pm at KIPP Indy Legacy High School, and is powered by Cummins Inc.We are inviting local and national media outlets to attend this groundbreaking event, as well as to print details in order to raise awareness to the importance of having access to culturally relevant literature within our communities.

After declining 13.4% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for HPThe RSI reading of 29.71 for HP is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering HP in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 6.6% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, HP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

This trial, validated with live traffic on a Vodafone commercial network, is based on an open, software-driven architecture that demonstrates the power of openness and intelligence to effectively address the key business challenges faced by mobile operators today – OPEX control, service differentiation, customer experience and sustainability, among others.The Admission Control use case combines both the rApp and xApp from Juniper, allowing real-time tracking and optimization of radio resources such as User Equipment (UEs)/tenant and Power Distribution Unit (PDUs)/tenant based on current traffic utilization. The application allows for the dynamic allocation of network resources without the need for over-provisioning all the way to specific customers, therefore improving resource management and network efficiency. As a result, operators can achieve cost savings with streamlined operations and reduced equipment needs while providing a higher quality of service to end users.The Traffic Steering xApp from Parallel Wireless, in conjunction with Juniper’s rApp, enhances the user experience by dynamically and automatically distributing network load. Based on the traffic/cell conditions in Vodafone’s live network, throughput improvements of 40 percent were observed for users that were experiencing low performance due to cell overload, and an average of 15 percent to 30 percent improvement was observed across all users in the overloaded cell. This application efficiently utilizes operator resources to meet capacity demands without requiring manual intervention, thereby helping to reduce costs and to minimize errors.Story continuesBoth use cases successfully demonstrate that user experience can be managed and optimized automatically by the RIC, based on real-time data insights. These use cases can be implemented uniformly across RANs in a multi-vendor environment. The ability to deploy innovative applications from third-party vendors on top of the Juniper RIC platform helps mobile operators and third-party apps unlock the full potential and benefits of Open RAN.Sustainable networking is imperative for mobile operators, and successful RIC trials in Open RAN networks such as this one will help drive more energy-efficient and sustainable operations. RIC applications such as Admission Control can lower RAN energy consumption by avoiding over-provisioning of resources to handle peak traffic. Likewise, the Traffic Steering application allows efficient utilization of network resources to meet capacity demands while avoiding additional capital investments. These applications can also lower the overall RAN energy consumption, contributing to the achievement of mobile operators' sustainability targets.Vodafone and Juniper Networks will embark on the next phase of collaboration on the Radio Intelligence Controller with the development of advanced use cases such as energy saving and mMIMO optimization. The collaboration will also involve validating third-party rApp/xApp vendors using SDK and APIs exposed by the Juniper RIC.All three organizations are active operators/contributors of the O-RAN Alliance and the Telecom Infra Project (TIP), underlining their shared commitment to industry innovation and standards.Supporting Quotes""At Vodafone, we have a clear vision that Open RAN will transform networks into open platforms for innovation. The success of this trial represents the first RIC deployment in our live commercial network, aligned with the O-RAN Alliance specifications. We were pleased to come together with our partners, Juniper Networks and Parallel Wireless, to validate the successful performance of third-party app integration, demonstrating the power of openness and intelligence. There is tremendous potential in the RIC space outside of traditional use cases, and this represents only the beginning of demonstrating the full potential of Open RAN.""- Paco Martin, Head of Open RAN at Vodafone Group""We are thrilled to collaborate with a leading Open RAN pioneer like Vodafone and contribute to the potential that this trial represents for mobile operators and customers alike.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Prudential Financial (PRU). PRU is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 8.37, while its industry has an average P/E of 10.12. Over the past year, PRU's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.48 and as low as 7.31, with a median of 8.60.Investors should also note that PRU holds a PEG ratio of 0.68. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PRU's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.11. Within the past year, PRU's PEG has been as high as 1.13 and as low as 0.68, with a median of 0.95.Another notable valuation metric for PRU is its P/B ratio of 2.19. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 3.07. PRU's P/B has been as high as 2.39 and as low as 0.62, with a median of 1.25, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PRU has a P/S ratio of 0.58. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.9.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Prudential Financial's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that PRU is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more most promising future stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Most Promising Future Stocks to Buy.Future stocks are stocks of companies that could play a meaningful role in the future.Although it is impossible to know what the future will be exactly, it is likely that technology will continue to advance in the future with AI potentially being one of the key technologies.Some leading companies that do well in AI could potentially do well in the long term.While it is impossible to know exactly which companies will do well, the leading big tech companies with substantial financial resources have arguably a better chance of success in the future than companies that don't have as much resources.The leading big tech companies have world class employees and substantial datasets and processing power to make potentially useful AI applications.They also have huge existing userbases that they can offer AI apps to relatively quickly.The big tech companies also have the financial resources to buy into or invest into potentially transformative new tech companies.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), for instance, invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 and another $10 billion in 2023. OpenAI makes the popular chat app ChatGPT which although the app makes mistakes has reached 100 million users in just two months.With its investment, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also has the added benefit of potentially benefiting from more cloud computing demand as well and also potentially improving its search engine, Bing.When it comes to future stocks, stocks of companies with substantial competitive advantages that could play a part in the future, especially in technology, can be potential candidates for investments.That being said, the shares of many big tech companies did not do well in 2022 given the Federal Reserve raised interest rates substantially in response to high inflation. Although shares of many big companies have rallied this year, there is still potential economic uncertainty if the U.S. central bank raises rates too much further.Story continuesAs a result, the stock market has downside if economic data doesn't meet expectations and it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Promising Future Stocks to Buy, we selected 12 stocks of companies with substantial competitive advantages that could play a part in the future.We ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy.12 Most Promising Future Stocks to Buy12.

International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) could be part of the future given it has a growing hybrid cloud business and the company is also one of the leaders when it comes to quantum computing. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) said of its hybrid cloud opportunity, ""An important part of our open hybrid cloud platform’s value lies in the expertise and services we provide to help clients on their journey—whether that’s modernizing apps, building cloud-native apps, or migrating to the cloud.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Public Storage's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Public Storage How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Public Storage is:43% = US$4.4b ÷ US$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.43 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Public Storage's Earnings Growth And 43% ROETo begin with, Public Storage has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 6.8% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, Public Storage's exceptional 21% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Public Storage's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 13% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is PSA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Public Storage Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Public Storage has a very high three-year median payout ratio of 86%. This means that it has only 14% of its income left to reinvest into its business. However, it's not unusual to see a REIT with such a high payout ratio mainly due to statutory requirements. Regardless, this hasn't hampered its ability to grow as we saw earlier.Additionally, Public Storage has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 89% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Public Storage's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 35% for future ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Public Storage's performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

""The CHIPS and Science Act presents us with an opportunity to make investments that are similarly consequential for our nation’s future.”Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo speaks about semiconductors at the White House in September. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)Raimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.The speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works— and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.""Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,"" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America’s national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.Story continuesIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law ""the most significant competition policy in our generation."" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.The overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the “premier destination in the world” for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that “every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.”'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'The Biden administration’s challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.The situation is even worse with the world’s most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.Raimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. ""That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,"" she said.President Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Raimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.“Our success will be short-lived"" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&amp;D is what will make it a longer term success.""It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,"" she said.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added ""as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.""The new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer’s capital expenditures.Return on investment? National security. Raimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln’s creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy’s famous call to put a man on the moon.She noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy’s 1961 call—and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The next step in the administration’s plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo’s department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. “It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,” Raimondo told reporters.The speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.""I expect to be held accountable,"" Raimondo said.Meanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.Raimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.""Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,"" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country.

(NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”7. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)Bill Gates’ Stake Value: $265,751,498 Dividend Yield as of February 22: 2.24%FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is an American transport company that deals in e-commerce and other related services.

Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen were some of the company's leading stakeholders in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Earnings results at FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, disappointed due to slowing volumes—principally in its Express segment, which resulted in negative operating leverage—in addition to continued cost pressures. The Express business has been affected by trade disruptions in Asia from China’s COVID lockdowns, as well as the mix of global consumer spending trending back toward services and away from goods—a normalization of pandemic-driven consumer behavior. A key question for investors is how much of this demand slowdown is idiosyncratic and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is the start of a possible cyclical slowdown. To counter these headwinds, FedEx is looking to achieve cost reductions while it continues to implement multi-year structural cost reduction initiatives focused on technology investments and efficiency gains. Given a mixed track record and the recent earnings miss, there is a high degree of skepticism embedded in the current stock price as it sells for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings. While operating results can be choppy, the longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”6.

(NYSE:WMT), down from 68 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $4.8 billion.Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Bill Gates' Current Portfolio: Top 5 Dividend Stocks.  Suggested articles:12 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy11 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

307,e03b753e-66ff-327c-b547-06b88916e60f,AXP,2023-02-23,Can A.I. solve expense reports?,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solve-expense-reports-115455942.html,1677066895,STORY,['AXP'],"[Good morning,Sure, many of us dread A.I. doing things like composing music, writing articles, or making art—you know, things humans actually seem to enjoy. But there's one corporate task few wouldn't mind handing over to A.I.: completing expense reports.“We know expense reports are a necessity but, overall, business travelers hate doing them, and they take up a ton of time,” says Gunther Bright, EVP of global commercial services at American Express. “At the same time, every company has an increased need for control and compliance with expenses.”A recently released American Express Trendex survey found some business travelers would literally rather have back-to-back virtual meetings all day or have their flight delayed and sit in the airport rather than go through the process of filing expense reports. And those in accounting who process travel and expenses (T&amp;E) have grown tired of employees missing submission deadlines.Fifty-nine percent of T&amp;E processors surveyed, who currently do not have a completely autonomous expense report management system, said the biggest benefit to having one would be saving time. And 94% said there needs to be more innovation. Meanwhile, more than half (54%) of business travelers said gathering and keeping track of receipts is an area of frustration, the survey found. The data is based on the sentiment of 1,000 business travelers and 300 T&amp;E processors.American Express is working with Microsoft on a solution for the automation of expense management using A.I. and machine learning. After an employee makes a purchase with an American Express corporate card, they’ll be prompted to upload a photo of their receipt. “Auditors will be aided by the A.I. engine, which will enable auto-approval decisioning and generate automated audit alerts for red flags or anomalies, such as personal or non-compliant spend, based on integrated expense policy, spend limits, and spend controls,” Bright says.Story continuesLater this year, Microsoft will pilot the solution with its employees by integrating it into the company’s internal expense system. I asked Bright when the solution would be available to American Express corporate clients. An exact date and time hasn’t been set as they're still in the early phases, he says.Tech companies innovating in T&amp;E reporting include Workday (CFO Daily sponsor) with Workday Expenses, where employees are able to scan receipts on their mobile device to automatically populate data on mobile expense reports. It also uses machine learning to analyze submitted expense reports and calculate risk scores. Every transaction is recorded for audit transparency, and analytics are used to inform manager approvals and administrative decisions.The tech startup TripActions, renamed Navan, a travel, corporate card, and expense management company, is launching a new app that consolidates travel and expense offerings. With one app, users can search and book trips, change or cancel flights or hotels, and submit expenses, according to the company. Navan plans to incorporate OpenAI’s ChatGPT to expense reports.Speaking of T&amp;E, I asked Bright if there has been an increase in business travel for American Express corporate clients over the past year. “While we’re not yet back to 2019 T&amp;E levels in our global and large, corporate client segment, T&amp;E spending by these customers continued to recover in the fourth quarter of 2022,” he says. T&amp;E spending in the commercial services segment, which includes large corporate clients and small- and medium-sized enterprises, increased 44% on an FX-adjusted basis in Q4 of 2022, Bright says.Many finance professionals don't yet fully trust A.I. for all processes, according to Gartner. However, CFOs and their teams are leaning into A.I. for accounting processes like T&amp;E.""T&amp;E is a great starting point to experiment with A.I. because the policies are generally rules-driven and straightforward,"" says Marko Horvat, vice president of research in the Gartner Finance practice.

NetApp makes additional adjustments to the non-GAAP tax provision for certain tax matters as described below. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP results can be found at http://investors.netapp.com. NetApp’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes that the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance.6GAAP net income per share and non-GAAP net income per share are calculated using the diluted number of shares.7IDC MarketScape: ""Worldwide Desktop as a Service 2022–2023 Vendor Assessment,"" Shannon Kalvar.NetApp usage of non-GAAP financial informationTo supplement NetApp’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), NetApp provides investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow, billings, and historical and projected non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. NetApp also presents the hardware and software components of our GAAP product revenues. Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP measures. The hardware and software components of our product revenues are derived from an estimated fair value allocation of the transaction price of our contracts with customers, down to the level of the product hardware and software components. This allocation is primarily based on the contractual prices at which NetApp has historically billed customers for such respective components.NetApp believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rates, and non-GAAP earnings per share data, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.NetApp believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which it defines as the net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in its business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on its common stock. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.NetApp believes that the presentation of the software and hardware components of our product revenues is meaningful to investors and management as it illustrates the significance of the Company’s software and provides improved visibility into the value created by our software innovation and R&amp;D investment.NetApp approximates billings by adding net revenues as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period to the change in total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the same period. Billings is a performance measure that NetApp believes provides useful information to management and investors because it approximates the amounts under purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed.NetApp’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors’ operating results and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making.NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures when applicable:A. Amortization of intangible assets. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.B. Stock-based compensation expenses. NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the amount can fluctuate based on variables unrelated to the performance of the underlying business. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period.C. Litigation settlements. NetApp may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. NetApp excludes these charges and benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results.D. Acquisition-related expenses. NetApp excludes acquisition-related expenses, including (a) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges and (b) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are not related to our ongoing business or cost base and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.E. Restructuring charges. These charges consist of restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.F. Asset impairments. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.G. Gains/losses on the sale or derecognition of assets. These are gains/losses from the sale of our properties and other transactions in which we transfer control of assets to a third party. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.H. Gains/losses on the sale of investments in equity securities. These are gains/losses from the sale of our investment in certain equity securities. Typically, such investments are sold as a result of a change in control of the underlying businesses. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.I. Debt extinguishment costs. NetApp excludes certain non-recurring expenses incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of debt. Management believes such nonrecurring costs do not reflect the results of its underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.J. Income tax adjustments. NetApp’s non-GAAP tax provision is based upon a projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The non-GAAP tax provision also excludes, when applicable, (a) tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal periods that are a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, authoritative guidance, income tax audit settlements, statute lapses and/or court decisions, (b) tax charges or benefits that are attributable to unusual or non-recurring book and/or tax accounting method changes, (c) tax charges that are a result of a non-routine foreign cash repatriation, (d) tax charges or benefits that are a result of infrequent restructuring of the Company’s tax structure, (e) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in valuation allowance, and (f) tax charges resulting from the integration of intellectual property from acquisitions. Management believes that the use of non-GAAP tax provisions provides a more meaningful measure of the Company’s operational performance.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NetApp believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. NetApp management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and projected results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures.Constant CurrencyNetApp presents certain constant currency growth rates or quantifies the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on year-over-year fluctuations, including for net revenues, billings, and earnings. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results.About NetAppNetApp is a global, cloud-led, data-centric software company that empowers organizations to lead with data in the age of accelerated digital transformation.

When excluding the impact of foreign exchange, loss from continuing operations was $47.2 million and adjusted EBITDA was $670.4 million.Doug Pferdehirt, Chair and CEO of TechnipFMC, stated, ""We are in the midst of a multi-year growth cycle. Full-year inbound orders grew 20% versus 2021 to $8.1 billion, driven by Subsea inbound of $6.7 billion. This strong inbound resulted in 24% growth in Subsea backlog, helping drive total Company backlog to $9.4 billion at year-end.""""Total Company adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 20% to $670 million versus the prior year, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our results demonstrate further improvement in revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin in both operating segments and illustrate our strong commitment to deliver on our financial objectives.""Pferdehirt continued, ""In 2022, we materially improved our financial position. Cash provided by operating activities was $352 million, with free cash flow of $194 million. Gross debt declined by $638 million, a reduction of nearly one-third for the year.""""These actions enabled us to accelerate the timeline for shareholder distributions by twelve months with the authorization of a $400 million share buyback program in July. We repurchased $100 million of our shares in 2022, representing just over 50% of our free cash flow generation. We also remain committed to a quarterly dividend, which we intend to initiate in the second half of this year.""Pferdehirt added, ""Looking beyond 2022, we remain confident in the strength of this upcycle and continue to believe that international markets will lead the next leg of expansion, driven by offshore and the Middle East. More than 90% of our revenue is generated outside of North America land, and we have leading positions that are geographically levered to these important growth markets.""""Our Subsea Opportunities list, which highlights larger projects with the potential for award over the next 24 months, continues to represent a record level. This is a result of increased capital spending and an expanding customer base in all major offshore basins. We expect to see a material increase in the value of iEPCI™ awards in our 2023 inbound, leading to a record year for integrated project awards. We also forecast an increase in Subsea Services activity. Taken together, we expect our orders to exceed $8 billion in the year, of which 70% of inbound will come from direct awards, iEPCI™ and Subsea Services.""""In Surface Technologies, we expect the majority of revenue growth to come from international markets, largely driven by the Middle East. We anticipate revenue growth outside North America of approximately 20%. In North America, we continue to take actions to eliminate underperforming locations and product lines across the region, which we expect will have a favorable impact on profitability.""Pferdehirt continued, ""At the midpoint of our guidance for 2023, we anticipate total Company revenue growth of approximately 12% to $7.5 billion, with adjusted EBITDA expected to increase to approximately $870 million. This outlook for improved performance also extends beyond the current year. We now expect $25 billion of Subsea inbound for our company from 2023 through 2025, driven by the strength of the offshore market, industry adoption of iEPCI™, and the increased contribution of Subsea 2.0™. We have updated our intermediate-term outlook to reflect this improved environment. When compared to 2022, our revised Subsea forecast for 2025 demonstrates a 650 basis point expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin to 18% and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion.""Pferdehirt concluded, ""We enter the year with a strong market outlook and a further step-up in our targeted financial performance. We expect our 2025 outlook will demonstrate significant progress on our path to much improved financial returns. Most importantly, it does not mark an end point, but rather a major milestone on a more ambitious journey ahead.""Operational and Financial HighlightsSubseaFinancial HighlightsReconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in financial schedules.Three Months EndedChange(In millions)Dec. 31,2022Sep. 30,2022Dec. 31,2021SequentialYear-over-YearRevenue$1,342.5$1,415.0$1,236.2(5.1%)8.6%Operating profit$61.5$105.0$8.5(41.4%)623.5%Operating profit margin4.6%7.4%0.7%(280 bps)390 bpsAdjusted EBITDA$140.1$183.8$123.6(23.8%)13.3%Adjusted EBITDA margin10.4%13.0%10.0%(260 bps)40 bpsInbound orders$1,515.9$1,400.8$1,034.88.2%46.5%Ending backlog1,2,3$8,131.5$7,603.2$6,533.06.9%24.5%Estimated Consolidated Backlog Scheduling(In millions)Dec. 31,20222023$3,9192024$2,9012025 and beyond$1,311Total$8,1311 Backlog as of December 31, 2022 was increased by a foreign exchange impact of $345 million.2 Backlog does not capture all revenue potential for Subsea Services.3 Backlog as of December 31, 2022 does not include total Company non-consolidated backlog of $452 million.Subsea reported fourth quarter revenue of $1,342.5 million, a decrease of 5.1 percent from the third quarter.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $129.92 million.

Shares have lost about 3.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.1%.What's Next for Cactus, Inc.While Cactus, Inc. Has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cactus, Inc. Unfavorable.

In acknowledgment of the critical role that education plays in the advancement of Black people, Pentair's Black Employee Network (BEN) is highlighting the historical and current importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other cultural organizations in shaping future innovators and leaders.As part of our Black History Month celebrations, we were proud to host Dr. Keith Mayes, a professor in the Department of African American &amp; African Studies at the University of Minnesota, for a discussion centered on equity in education and its impact on inclusion, diversity and representation across various professional fields and industries. Pentair employees gathered in-person and virtually for his presentation, ""The Color of Achievement: Black Education as the Foundation for Freedom and Equality.""With more than 100 HBCUs across the United States, Professor Mayes spoke about the importance of these institutions from not only the academic perspective, but also the cultural experience. HBCUs provide an environment for young Black people to discover their unlimited potential as they are immersed with other Black scholars and intellectuals. This sentiment was supported by several of our BEN members who are HBCU alumni, and who shared that they emerged from their college experience with a greater sense of pride and confidence in both themselves and their culture.According to Professor Mayes, creating a cultural connection for employees is essential for companies that are looking to cultivate an inclusive workplace. At Pentair, our employee-led business resource groups such as the BEN work to help foster a sense of belonging across the organization, and provide an opportunity for employees to develop connections and share experiences and perspectives while also supporting each other in professional and personal development.Story continuesThe BEN has also been focused on collaborating with Pentair's talent acquisition team to attend recruiting events at HBCUs as well as other organizations to connect with students as we work to attract, engage and develop up and coming talent for career opportunities at Pentair. Through these efforts and more, the BEN strives to strengthen and enhance the relationship of Pentair's Black employees with each other and with the broader organization.Read more about Pentair's business resource groups and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Pentair on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PentairWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pentairEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PentairView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/740409/Celebrating-Black-History-Month-The-Color-of-Achievement]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Conagra Brands Inc. CAG, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Philip Morris International Inc. PM and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Solid Economic Data Unnerves Investors: 5 Low-Beta PicksU.S. stock markets have seen northbound movement so far this year after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 2.1%, 6.2% and 12.6%, respectively. However, off late, volatility has returned on Wall Street.Several strong economic data and hotter-than-expected inflation rates of January raised concerns that the Fed's tighter monetary control and higher interest rate regime is unlikely to terminate any time soon. Market participants confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent. Volatility is likely to continue in the near term.Strong Economic Data for JanuaryThe nonfarm payrolls for January jumped to 517,000 in January from 260,000 in December. The consensus estimate was 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4% in January from 3.5% in the previous month. The consensus estimate was 3.6%.The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales unexpectedly jumped 3% in January after declining 1.1% in December. The consensus estimate was an increase of 1.7%. The ISM Services Index climbed to 55.2% in January from 49.2% In December. The consensus estimate was 50.6%. Any reading above 50% means an expansion in services activities.Industrial production was unchanged in January after falling 0.6% and 1% in November and December, respectively. Within the overall industrial production, manufacturing and mining output rose 1% and 2%, respectively. The output of utilities fell 9.9% in January due to unseasonably warm weather in January.Story continuesGood Economic Data Bad for Wall StreetStrong economic data has unnerved investors as a higher wage rate will raise aggregate demand, making inflation stubborn. The consumer price Index and the producer price Index of January were reported last week. These two key inflation measures were higher than the consensus mark, indicating that the Fed has to go a long way to tame inflation to near 2%.The fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up further following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He said that he had proposed a 50-basis point rate hike in the Fed's last meeting and such a hike could be expected in the March meeting. Bullard's sentiments were echoed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, saying that she also supports a steeper rate hike in the next meeting, which further weighed on stocks.On Feb 17, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said ""I think there's a long way to go before we reach our 2% inflation objective and I think we'll have to continue to raise the federal funds rate until we see a lot more progress on that.""Fearing a prolonged higher interest rate regime, the ICE dollar index rose 0.25% last week. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note rose 8.4 basis points last week to close at 3.827%.The Dow fell recorded three consecutive weeks of decline. This happened for the first time since September 2022. The S&amp;P 500 posted losses for two successive weeks for the first time in 2023.Stock Selection ProcessAt this stage, we have applied a broad selection criteria. First, we have selected stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care. Second, we have chosen low-beta stocks. Third, high dividend yield stocks have been handpicked. Finally, we have picked stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low- beta will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer staples stocks with low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) and a solid dividend yield. These companies have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Conagra Brands Inc. has been benefiting from its robust pricing actions, which aided the top line in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Results gained from strength in CAG's brands, efficient pricing and the ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook. Conagra Brands delivered improved service and productivity amid ongoing inflationary pressures and industry-wide supply-chain hurdles.Management expects the inflationary landscape to persist in fiscal 2023. Nonetheless, pricing and innovation are likely to aid CAG. We expect organic sales to increase 4.9% in fiscal 2023, which is at the higher end of management's view of 4-5%.Conagra Brands has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.2% and 12.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending May 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the last 30 days. CAG has a current dividend yield of 3.63% and a beta of 0.56.The Coca-Cola Co. has benefited from its strategic transformation and ongoing recovery around the world. Strength across the majority of markets, investments in marketplace, recovery in certain markets as well as the cycling of last year's pandemic-led impacts aided volumes. KO is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.Coca-Cola has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.9% and 4.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.2% over the last seven days. KO has a current dividend yield of 2.93% and a beta of 0.55.The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. has benefited from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. PG's products play a key role in meeting the daily health, hygiene and cleaning needs of consumers around the world. PG witnessed continued strong momentum as reflected by underlying strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which aided its organic sales growth.Procter &amp; Gamble remains focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. Its continued investment in business alongside efforts to offset macro cost headwinds and balance top and bottom-line growth underscores its productivity efforts. PG is witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of the business.Procter &amp; Gamble has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, for the current year (June 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. PG has a current dividend yield of 2.61% and a beta of 0.42.Philip Morris International Inc. has long been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to PM's performance across most regions. Additionally, the focus on reduced-risk products (RRPs), especially IQOS has been working well for PM, which is witnessing continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. Smoke-free products and RRPs are generating strong revenues.Philip Morris has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.1% and 5.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.8% over the last seven days. PM has a current dividend yield of 4.99% and a beta of 0.68.Mondelez International Inc. has been gaining from the strength in emerging markets and its core chocolate and biscuit categories. MDLZ has also been focused on strengthening areas with higher growth potential via prudent buyouts (like Clif Bar and Ricolino) and divestitures (like the developed market gum business).These upsides, together with pricing actions, fueled the fourth-quarter 2022 results of MDLZ. Driven by the solid results and continued momentum in the snacks business, management issued an impressive view for 2023.Mondelez International has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9% and 7.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 30 days. MDLZ has a current dividend yield of 2.3% and a beta of 0.65.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This compares to earnings of $0.12 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 295.83%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this independent upstream energy company would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.55, delivering a surprise of 19.57%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Berry Petroleum , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, posted revenues of $194.68 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.65%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $208.09 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Berry Petroleum shares have added about 10.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.1%.What's Next for Berry Petroleum?While Berry Petroleum has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Berry Petroleum: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.33 on $172.7 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.37 on $699.75 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States is currently in the bottom 16% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Occidental Petroleum (OXY), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 27.This oil and gas exploration and production company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.7%.

328,03e4855e-f3b4-324a-8e2f-46c589a2244a,ULTA,2023-02-23,5 Top Stocks Likely to Come Up With Earnings Beat,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stocks-likely-come-113711897.html,1677152231,STORY,"['ULTA', 'HOLX']","[It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality in nature.Ulta Beauty ULTA, Hologic HOLX, Fortinet FTNT, Splunk SPLK and ServiceNow NOW are some of the stocks that can beat earnings estimates in the upcoming reporting season.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise, though apparently looks good, doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project the earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to eight.Here are five out of the eight stocks:Ulta Beauty ULTA: The company offers a wide range of products, including cosmetics, fragrance, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of ULTA for the past four quarters is 26.18%.Hologic HOLX: Zacks Rank #1 Hologic develops, manufactures and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products, which cater to the healthcare needs of women.The average earnings surprise of HOLX for the past four quarters is 30.60%.Fortinet FTNT: The Zacks Rank #2 company is a provider of network security appliances and Unified Threat Management network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide.The average earnings surprise of FTNT for the past four quarters is 15.78%.Splunk SPLK: The Zacks Rank #2 company provides software solutions that enable enterprises to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data.The average earnings surprise of SPLK for the past four quarters is 222.03%.ServiceNow NOW: This Zacks Rank #2 company provides cloud computing services that automate digital workflows to accelerate enterprise IT operations.The average earnings surprise of NOW for the past four quarters is 6.91%.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

The year-ago period figure comprised of both grant and collaboration revenues. Revenues substantially missed both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $12.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.Post the announcement of the fourth-quarter results, CRISPR’s shares rose 1.3% in after-market trading on Feb 21. Yet, the stock has declined 16.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 6.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailFor the reported quarter, research and development expenses rose 0.4% year over year to $103.6 million, while general and administrative expenses were down 10.6% to $21.2 million.Collaboration expenses for the third quarter reached $6.8 million, down 78.6% year-over-year. This significant decline was attributed to the company’s exercise of an option deferring specified costs on the exa-cel program, which is being developed in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX.As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.87 billion compared with $1.97 billion as of Sep 30, 2022.Full-Year ResultsFor 2022, CRISPR Therapeutics generated total revenues of $1.2 million, reflecting a substantial decline from the previous year’s revenues of $915.0 million, almost all of which was received as collaboration revenues from Vertex Pharmaceuticals.For the same period, the company reported a loss of $8.36 per share against the year-ago earnings of $4.70.Pipeline UpdatesCRISPR Therapeutics is developing exa-cel — an investigational ex-vivo CRISPR gene-edited therapy for treating sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) — in partnership with Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Story continuesLast November, partner Vertex started a rolling biologics licensing application (BLA) submission with the FDA seeking approval for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications. The companies expect to complete the submission by the end of first-quarter 2023. Vertex has also already filed similar submissions on exa-cel in Europe last December.Apart from exa-cel, CRISPR Therapeutics is also developing two chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy candidates — CTX110 and CTX130 — for hematological and solid-tumor cancers.Last December, management announced data from the phase I CARBON study, which evaluated CTX110 in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. Data from the study showed the benefits of consolidation dosing with CTX110, including a further improvement in the efficacy profile of study participants. Based on these results, management started a phase II study evaluating the consolidation regimen of CTX110.CRISPR is also advancing several next-generation CAR-T product candidates, namely — CTX112 targeting CD19 antigen and CTX131 targeting CD70 antigen. These candidates have been designed to enhance CAR-T potency. Clinical studies on both candidates are expected to start later this year.CRISPR Therapeutics also announced plans to advance its lead in vivo program, CTX310, into clinical development later this year. The candidate has been designed to target angiopoietin-related protein 3 (ANGPTL3), which is responsible for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.CRISPR Therapeutics AG Price CRISPR Therapeutics AG PriceCRISPR Therapeutics AG price | CRISPR Therapeutics AG Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCRISPR Therapeutics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are eFFECTOR Therapeutics EFTR, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and ADMA Biologics ADMA, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Elevance Health, Inc. ELV, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. VRTX, Sony Group Corp. SONY and General Mills, Inc. GIS.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stocks for JPMorgan Chase, Elevance Health and Vertex PharmaceuticalsThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Elevance Health, Inc. and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (+22.0% vs. +7.8%). The company's fourth-quarter 2022 results show impacts of higher rates, decent loan demand and a rise in expenses and provisions. Opening new branches, strategic buyouts and global expansion will keep driving financials. Higher rates and a steady loan demand will aid net interest income (NII) growth.The Zacks analyst estimates for NII (managed) show a CAGR of 6.2% by 2025. Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to make fee income growth challenging. We expect non-interest income (managed) to be relatively stable this year.Steadily rising costs is a major woe, and we expect the same to rise 5.8% in 2023. Given the possibility of an economic slowdown, provisions are likely to keep rising, with we projecting the same to jump 53.1% in 2023.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Elevance Health shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Services industry over the past year (+11.5% vs. -18.4%). The company's improving top line can be attributed to premium rate increases and higher memberships. Acquisitions, collaborations and product expansions have enabled the company to strengthen its business portfolio.Its well-performing Medicare and Medicaid businesses, coupled with several contract wins, are expected to drive its membership going ahead. Growing premiums, stemming from rate increases are aiding the company's results. Elevance Health utilizes excess capital to boost shareholder value.However, the company's escalating expenses continue to put pressure on margins. Its declining cash flows are also concerning. ELV's balance sheet with a massive debt of more than $22.3 billion can affect financial flexibility. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Elevance Health here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+27.6% vs. -6.7%). The company's cystic franchise sales continue to grow, driven by its triple therapy, Trikafta/Kaftrio. New reimbursement agreements in ex-U.S. markets and label expansions to younger age groups are driving Trikafta/Kaftrio sales higher.Vertex reported double-digit revenue growth over the last several years. Vertex has a broad clinical non-CF pipeline across six disease areas, which are progressing rapidly with multiple clinical milestones in 2023. Multiple late-stage projects have established proof of concept.Vertex faces only minimal competition in its core CF franchise. However, Vertex's dependence on just the CF franchise for commercial revenues is a concern. Vertex's non-CF programs carry significant risk, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Sony Group Corp. and General Mills, Inc.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

335,53208585-33ad-37a8-b084-4bd1d3187a41,TXT,2023-02-23,Is Textron (TXT) a Great Stock for Value Investors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/textron-txt-great-stock-value-151303077.html,1677078783,STORY,"['TXT', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Textron Inc. TXT stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Textron has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.29, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 18.39. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Textron’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint (which is 18.24) over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Aerospace sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 40.45. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that Textron has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Textron stock in the near term too.Story continuesP/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Textron has a P/S ratio of about 1.2. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.64x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Textron currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Textron a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Textron is just 1.41, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2.35. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, TXT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Textron might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of B. This gives TXT a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been robust at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen five up and one down in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 7.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased by 7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Textron Inc. Price and ConsensusTextron Inc. Price and ConsensusTextron Inc. price-consensus-chart | Textron Inc. QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineTextron is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 42% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence. However, over the past two years, the Zacks Aerospace – Defense industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Insurance will help offset those costs, including a liability policy that will cover up to $1.1 billion in certain situations.The company also said in a statement on Wednesday it would excavate soil and replace tracks in the derailment area as part of a remediation plan that will also include sampling of soil and surface water.Story continuesThat plan failed to assuage people in the CNN town hall, who peppered Shaw with questions about why the train that derailed continued to run even after signs the wheels were overheating, why the original remediation plan neglected to excavate soil beneath the tracks, and why train service resumed so quickly.""I'm angry,"" said Jim Stewart, 65, who lives near the accident site.Stewart said he was planning to sell his house so he could retire but now his property value had plummeted. ""You seem like a sincere man. I'm not calling you names. But your company stinks.""Shaw said he could not comment on the accident pending an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which has said it would release a preliminary report on its initial findings on Thursday into the derailment.U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will travel to the site on Thursday to meet community members and attend a briefing on the investigation. He will be joined by representatives from the Federal Railroad Administration and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

The change comes in response to feedback from the citizens of East Palestine, Ohio. Work on the first rail line will begin immediately, with the second line to be replaced directly after. Norfolk Southern Corporation Logo (PRNewsfoto/Norfolk Southern Corporation)""Our original plan would have effectively and safely remediated the soil under our tracks. As I listened to community members over the past two weeks, they shared with me their concerns about that approach. I appreciate the direct feedback, and I am addressing it. In coordination with Ohio and U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies, we are changing our remediation plan to temporarily remove the tracks so we can excavate the soil. It is important to me that the members of this community have confidence in Norfolk Southern's remediation efforts and that we are working closely with local, state, and federal agencies. An important part of this plan is to listen to the concerns of the community and that's a primary reason why we are going to enhance our plan,"" said Norfolk Southern President and CEO Alan H. Shaw.All of Norfolk Southern's work at the site has been performed in accordance with widely accepted environmental practices. To date, the company has excavated more than 4,800 cubic yards of soil, or approximately 400 truckloads. Additionally, 1.7 million gallons, or approximately 200 tanker loads, of liquid have been collected for disposal.The work will begin immediately. Soil preparation will be followed by track removal along the first rail line, excavation of the soil, and then rebuilding the track. The same process will then follow with the second track. Trains will continue running at slower speeds on one track while the other is being excavated.The site will be fully remediated in accordance with the company's long-term plan that is being developed with the Ohio and U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies. Below is an overview of the process for the next two weeks:Story continuesRemediation OverviewBegin preparation for the removal and excavation of the first rail line.Install and begin sampling shallow groundwater monitoring wells near the site.Continue active soil sampling around the site.Continue evaluating sediment and sampling in Sulphur Run, Leslie Run, and Bull Creek.Continue to excavate soil on the site.Continue surface water sampling, while monitoring and aerating the streams.Evaluate the stormwater infrastructure around the site.Continue the disposal of impacted water at an approved disposal facility.Begin shipping impacted soil to an approved disposal facility.For more information on Norfolk Southern's community engagement and progress in East Palestine, please visit: NSMakingitRight.com.About Norfolk SouthernSince 1827, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) and its predecessor companies have moved the goods and materials that drive the U.S. economy.

Norfolk Southern did not reply to specific inquiries about how much each car was carrying.Federal rules specify how much of any toxic chemical can be carried in a particular rail car, and based on experts saying the cars were likely to be full to be cost effective, Reuters calculated that up to 1.1 million pounds of vinyl chloride was likely aboard.The same figure was cited in a federal class action lawsuit filed in federal court last week by Morgan &amp; Morgan law firm against Norfolk Southern Railway and parent company Norfolk Southern Corp.Such an amount would be more than twice the amount emitted across the entire United States by companies in 2021, the latest year of available data in the EPA's ""toxic release inventory"" database.The EPA said in an email that most of the vinyl chloride was purposefully set afire to avoid a catastrophic explosion while cars burned for days.Vinyl chloride is a highly flammable, carcinogenic gas used in making plastic products that can cause dizziness, headaches and drowsiness when inhaled in the short term and a rare form of liver cancer after chronic exposure, the EPA has said.The agency said it did not know how much of other hazardous materials was leaked and did not confirm how much was aboard, but said ""response efforts assumed all the contents of the rail cars leaked to ensure the most protective action.""Norfolk Southern declined to comment in response to requests for details on the amounts of chemicals involved. The company CFO said on Wednesday the company will take responsibility for cleaning up after the derailment.Story continuesThe National Transportation Safety Board plans to release a preliminary report on Thursday on its initial findings into the crash. Former President Donald Trump visited the site on Wednesday.WHAT ARE THE RISKS TO THE PUBLIC?The EPA has said repeatedly that its tests of drinking water and air inside homes near the wreck site have not shown any contamination.But that, experts say, does not answer the question of what exposure residents suffered in the hours immediately after the wreck, before monitoring was in place.Ila Cote, a toxicologist who worked at the EPA for nearly three decades carrying out disaster risk assessments on public health and is now a private consultant, said the long-term health damage, such as increased likelihood of cancer, from the short-term initial exposure to the toxic chemicals is extremely complicated to determine.""The data on cancer risk from a single high exposure is not good,"" Cote said. ""But it would certainly be safe to say that if people had been highly exposed to vinyl chloride, they would incur increased risk of cancer.""WHAT ARE OTHER CONCERNS?Three days after the crash, state and local officials said concerns about a massive explosion as pressure built in rail cars carrying the toxic chemicals forced them to drain five cars of vinyl chloride into a makeshift ditch and purposefully set it ablaze.That controlled burn created new carcinogenic byproducts known as dioxins, said Murray McBride, a Cornell University emeritus professor with expertise in environmental toxicology.He said those pollutants were carried away in a giant plume of smoke and likely came back to earth on soot, potentially contaminating several miles of land downwind where it could enter the food supply and upend the agricultural industry in the area.It is crucial, McBride said, to learn how much of the chemicals may have combusted during the ""controlled burn"" versus how much seeped into groundwater, where it can persist for decades and remain a deadly risk.Cote, the former EPA toxicologist, said that such controlled burns are often times the best decision emergency responders can make in such situations.""I'm generally in favor of these types of controlled burns, If you get these chemicals leaking out, it's hard to deal with them quickly, you can't just scoop them up,"" Cote said.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Conagra Brands Inc. CAG, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Philip Morris International Inc. PM and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Solid Economic Data Unnerves Investors: 5 Low-Beta PicksU.S. stock markets have seen northbound movement so far this year after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 2.1%, 6.2% and 12.6%, respectively. However, off late, volatility has returned on Wall Street.Several strong economic data and hotter-than-expected inflation rates of January raised concerns that the Fed's tighter monetary control and higher interest rate regime is unlikely to terminate any time soon. Market participants confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent. Volatility is likely to continue in the near term.Strong Economic Data for JanuaryThe nonfarm payrolls for January jumped to 517,000 in January from 260,000 in December. The consensus estimate was 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4% in January from 3.5% in the previous month. The consensus estimate was 3.6%.The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales unexpectedly jumped 3% in January after declining 1.1% in December. The consensus estimate was an increase of 1.7%. The ISM Services Index climbed to 55.2% in January from 49.2% In December. The consensus estimate was 50.6%. Any reading above 50% means an expansion in services activities.Industrial production was unchanged in January after falling 0.6% and 1% in November and December, respectively. Within the overall industrial production, manufacturing and mining output rose 1% and 2%, respectively. The output of utilities fell 9.9% in January due to unseasonably warm weather in January.Story continuesGood Economic Data Bad for Wall StreetStrong economic data has unnerved investors as a higher wage rate will raise aggregate demand, making inflation stubborn. The consumer price Index and the producer price Index of January were reported last week. These two key inflation measures were higher than the consensus mark, indicating that the Fed has to go a long way to tame inflation to near 2%.The fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up further following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He said that he had proposed a 50-basis point rate hike in the Fed's last meeting and such a hike could be expected in the March meeting. Bullard's sentiments were echoed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, saying that she also supports a steeper rate hike in the next meeting, which further weighed on stocks.On Feb 17, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said ""I think there's a long way to go before we reach our 2% inflation objective and I think we'll have to continue to raise the federal funds rate until we see a lot more progress on that.""Fearing a prolonged higher interest rate regime, the ICE dollar index rose 0.25% last week. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note rose 8.4 basis points last week to close at 3.827%.The Dow fell recorded three consecutive weeks of decline. This happened for the first time since September 2022. The S&amp;P 500 posted losses for two successive weeks for the first time in 2023.Stock Selection ProcessAt this stage, we have applied a broad selection criteria. First, we have selected stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care. Second, we have chosen low-beta stocks. Third, high dividend yield stocks have been handpicked. Finally, we have picked stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low- beta will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer staples stocks with low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) and a solid dividend yield. These companies have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Conagra Brands Inc. has been benefiting from its robust pricing actions, which aided the top line in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management What Is Waste Management's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2022 Waste Management had US$14.7b of debt, an increase on US$13.1b, over one year. However, it also had US$351.0m in cash, and so its net debt is US$14.3b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Waste Management's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Waste Management had liabilities of US$4.39b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$20.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$351.0m as well as receivables valued at US$2.75b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$21.4b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Waste Management has a huge market capitalization of US$62.1b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Waste Management has net debt to EBITDA of 2.6 suggesting it uses a fair bit of leverage to boost returns. On the plus side, its EBIT was 9.1 times its interest expense, and its net debt to EBITDA, was quite high, at 2.6. One way Waste Management could vanquish its debt would be if it stops borrowing more but continues to grow EBIT at around 16%, as it did over the last year. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Waste Management's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Waste Management produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 69% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewWaste Management's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But truth be told we feel its net debt to EBITDA does undermine this impression a bit. All these things considered, it appears that Waste Management can comfortably handle its current debt levels.

The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is one of the most popular ETFs in the United States and has become a mainstay in many investors’ portfolios. This is due to the fund's long track record of strong performance. Over the past decade, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 nine out of ten times.Overall, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is a great option for risk averse investors looking to gain exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index. It is a low-cost, liquid, and diversified ETF that has consistently provided strong returns over time. However, for investors that have a higher risk tolerance, investing in individual QQQ stocks can lead to potentially higher returns.Investing in stocks that make up the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) can provide investors with the opportunity to benefit from individual company performance without the risk of being exposed to the broader market. However, investors should be mindful of the risks associated with investing in individual stocks.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail.Most Promising QQQ Stocks According to Hedge FundsOur MethodologyWe sifted through holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) and sourced the hedge fund sentiment for each stock from Insider Monkey's database.

Along with each stock, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment, analyst ratings, and top shareholders.Most Promising QQQ Stocks According to Hedge Funds15. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) is a leading cybersecurity company that provides various information security services for enterprise, cloud, and government sectors. The company provides endpoint protection, cloud security, network security, and advanced threat prevention among others. As of February 21, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) has gained 20.54% year to date.On February 21, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $1.05 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.27. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.66 billion, up 25.68% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $5.54 million.This February, Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges started coverage of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) with a Buy rating and a $205 price target.At the close of Q4 2022, 85 hedge funds were long Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) and disclosed positions worth $3.27 billion in the company. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the largest investor and held a stake worth $363.7 million. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) is one of the most promising QQQ stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection within the IT sector was the main detractor from relative performance during the period. In addition to rate hikes compressing the multiples of longerduration, high growth companies, recession concerns were also a headwind. IT companies which had proven resilient against customer budget reductions earlier in the year are starting to feel the impact of spending slowdowns as companies further scrutinize expenses in light of economic uncertainty. For example, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), which provides enterprise security solutions including next-generation firewalls and threat detection software, faced a challenging environment as customers delayed purchases and orders. However, we remain convinced of the company’s long-term growth prospects as an industry leader in a critical field and as digital attacks and ransomware continue to grow.”14. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the most promising QQQ stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“Even as rates rose and the macro environment devolved, we believed Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was best positioned to grow and thrive, even through a period of extreme uncertainty. They are the market leader in rapidly growing end markets and have spent the past decade growing their competitive advantages and building out physical infrastructure with worldwide reach. While we believe we were right regarding the direction of fundamentals, this was overcome by a vast array of factors we didn’t anticipate that negatively impacted the price.By and large, Tesla had amazing execution in 2022. They managed to achieve 40% YOY delivery growth. In addition, revenue growth should exceed 50% and profit growth should exceed 120% YOY once Q4 numbers are released. This was accomplished while navigating a myriad of difficulties including a prolonged shutdown at their most productive plant in Shanghai. They scaled two factories on different continents while maintaining industry-leading margins and continued to make advanced progress in transformational technologies that have fast future cash flow potential like AI, software, and manufacturing. Through all the noise a lot of remarkable progress was made…” (Click here to read the full text)13. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American software company specializing in business and financial management software. On January 4, KeyBanc analyst Josh Beck raised his price target on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) to $425 from $400 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares.Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) was held by 92 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022. These funds held collective positions worth $5.62 billion in the company, up from $5.11 billion in the preceding quarter with 86 positions. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive and the stock is one of the most promising QQQ stocks according to hedge funds.As of December 31, Durable Capital Partners is the most prominent shareholder in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and has a position worth $681.6 million in the company.Here is what Fundsmith had to say about Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its 2022 yearly investor letter:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow. ..” (Click here to read the full text)12. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 94On February 1, T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported an EPS of $1.59 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.53. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $20.27 billion.On February 3, Citi analyst Michael Rollins raised his price target on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) to $176 from $174 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.At the end of Q4 2022, 94 hedge funds were eager on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and held collective stakes worth $3.71 billion in the company. Of those, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in the company and has disclosed a position worth $733.8 million.11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is ranked eleventh among the most promising QQQ stocks according to hedge funds. At the end of Q4 2022, 97 hedge funds held stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The total value of these stakes amounted to $5.70 billion. This is compared to 89 positions in the preceding quarter with stakes worth $4.99 billion. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive.On February 14, Benchmark analyst Cody Acree raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to $103 from $93 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares.As of December 31, Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and has a position worth $424.7 million.Here is what L1 Capital International had to say about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The share price of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was weak during the quarter and weakened further in early October when the pre-announced revenue was significantly below prior guidance, reflecting an acute slowdown in the PC market. Data centre related revenue grew strongly, albeit below our expectations, while gaming and embedded revenue was in line with our base case.Geopolitical risks have increased for the semiconductor sector, with the U.S. Government announcing restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. Despite near term headwinds, AMD is well positioned for the medium term, with a technology lead over Intel in servers for data centres and rapidly gaining share in the PC/notebook sectors. Its gaming and embedded applications continue to grow strongly. AMD is a very capital light business, with manufacturing outsourced. After expending nearly $5b on research and development, AMD generates around $5b of free cashflow. With a net cash balance sheet, we expect management will accelerate buyback activity at a share price well below fair value.The share price of our more cyclical businesses, in particularly the building products companies which have exposure to the U.S. residential, repair and renovation and infrastructure sectors, were broadly flat for the quarter. Rapidly escalating mortgage rates and rapidly reducing affordability will have a pronounced negative effect on near term new residential construction activity. We believe these cyclical pressures are well understood and are more than reflected in current share prices. Overall, we strongly believe share prices are overly reflecting near-term challenges and our portfolio of companies are now meaningfully undervalued.”10. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Wall Street sees upside to Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). On February 15, UBS analyst Karl Keirstead raised his price target on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) to $400 from $350 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares.Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was held by 99 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022. These funds disclosed collective positions worth $8.38 billion in the company. This is compared to 93 hedge funds in Q3 2022 with collective stakes worth $6.74 billion. The hedge fund sentiment for Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is positive.As of December 31, Fundsmith LLP is the largest shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and has a position worth $709.8 million in the company.Here is what Andvari Associates had to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of several software companies we own. Its suite of creative products (Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat, Lightroom, etc.) are the industry standard for creative professionals. Adobe also has a suite of customer experience products that help other businesses sell more easily to consumers. All of Adobe’s products have high switching costs and sold on a subscription basis.Adobe’s business qualities enable extremely high margins and predictable, recurring revenues. The company had revenues of $17.6 billion in its last fiscal year with operating margins in the mid-30s. The company has also grown revenues at double-digit rates every year since 2015. Despite a good record of investing in its businesses, it still has an excess of cash on its balance sheet. As such, Adobe has returned cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Since 2015 the company has returned a total of $24.5 billion.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106Hedge funds are piling into NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is placed ninth on our list of the most promising QQQ stocks according to hedge funds.Here is what O’keefe Stevens Advisory had to say about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The market and our portfolios had a challenging year as interest rates rose, and deteriorating fundamentals cut our largest position, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in half. Since our initial purchase in 2013, NVDA has seen its stock decline 50% one other time, back in 2018. The best-performing businesses and stocks do not go up and to the right. Mr. Market gets moody, and even one of the highest quality companies in the world is not immune. Drawdowns of this magnitude are challenging to stomach, even though the stock is up 50x in less than ten years. While we consider ourselves old school value investors, we continue to hold this fantastic company even though, optically, it does not appear cheap. Our confidence in Jensen remains, and while gaming is no longer in hyper-growth mode, the Data Center segment continues to grow. AI, Automotive, and other small but rapidly growing industries are the next leg of the story. Chris Mayer discusses the position in greater detail with commentary from our CIO, Peter O’Keefe.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) to $103 from $95 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares.At the end of Q4 2022, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was a part of 115 investors' portfolios. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $5.10 billion. As of December 31, Citadel Investment Group is the most prominent shareholder in the company and has a position worth $481 million.Here is what RGA Investment Advisors had to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) suffered with the slowdown in e-commerce, yet still will have outgrown e-commerce when we see final 2022 numbers. Much like Amazon, PayPal invested far too aggressively on the expectation of sustained elevated growth rates in e-commerce and unfortunately, unlike with Amazon, PayPal’s investment was on ancillary product excursions from which the company is already retrenching. The good news is that with this retrenchment, the company should once again return to its recipe of healthy top line growth and incremental margin leverage, but rather than grow back into their old margin structure they will have to cost-cut their way there.”7. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 117Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is ranked seventh among the most promising QQQ stocks according to hedge funds. The stock was held by 117 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $8.14 billion, up from $6.66 billion in the previous quarter with 115 positions.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) appreciated 25% in the quarter, well off its lows but still down more than 50% on the year. Q3 results saw a return to subscriber growth, with the firm adding 2.4m and finishing at an all time high 223m subscribers. Netflix also debuted its much-anticipated advertising tier in November, pricing it at a 30% discount in the US. While it is still very early days, we think by 2028 Netflix’s ad-supported tier will have tens of millions of subscribers and generate $10+ billion in revenue at high margins. We expect earnings to exceed $30 per share by then, roughly triple what the company earns today.”6. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 129On February 6, Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) reported strong earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

INTU may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Intuit is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for INTU in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.44 per share for INTU, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for INTU, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.42% heading into earnings season.Intuit Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIntuit Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIntuit Inc. price-eps-surprise | Intuit Inc.

This compares to earnings of $2.02 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 26.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this kidney dialysis provider would post earnings of $1.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.45, delivering a surprise of -12.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.DaVita HealthCare , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry, posted revenues of $2.92 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.75%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.94 billion. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.DaVita HealthCare shares have added about 11.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.1%.What's Next for DaVita HealthCare?While DaVita HealthCare has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for DaVita HealthCare: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.17 on $2.83 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.46 on $11.71 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Chemed (CHE), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 23.This operator of the Roto-Rooter plumbing service and Vitas Healthcare hospices is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.30 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1%.

Normalized non-acquired treatment growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was (2.1)%.Story continuesThree months endedQuarterchangeYear endedAnnual changeDecember 31,2022September 30,2022December 31,2022December 31,2021(dollars in millions, except per treatment data)Revenue per treatment$ 366.30$ 367.67$ (1.37)$ 365.24$ 359.24$ 6.00Patient care costs per treatment$ 257.60$ 255.86$ 1.74$ 253.31$ 241.47$ 11.84General and administrative$ 283$ 297$ (14)$ 1,038$ 926$ 112Primary drivers of the changes in the table above were as follows:Revenue: The quarter change was primarily due to non-recurring favorable adjustments in the third quarter. These changes were partially offset by increased hospital inpatient dialysis revenues, favorable changes in government rate driven by administration of influenza vaccines, favorable changes in commercial mix and the continued migration to Medicare Advantage plans. The annual change was primarily driven by an increase in commercial mix and rate, an increase in the Medicare base rate in 2022 and the continued shift to Medicare Advantage plans, partially offset by the reinstatement of 1% Medicare sequestration beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022 and 2% Medicare sequestration beginning July 1, 2022 and thereafter.Patient care costs: The quarter change was primarily due to increased other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, including increases in utilities expense partially due to lower expense in the third quarter related to our virtual power purchase arrangements. Other drivers of the increase include increases in health benefit expenses, pharmaceutical costs and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by decreases in compensation costs primarily due to a decrease in contract labor costs and improved productivity, and medical supply expense. The annual change was primarily due to increases in compensation expenses, other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, including increases in utilities expense, as well as closure costs, insurance expenses and costs related to travel. In addition, our fixed other direct operating expenses negatively impacted patient care costs per treatment due to decreased treatments in 2022. These annual increases were partially offset by decreases in pharmaceutical unit costs, health benefit expenses and medical supply costs.General and administrative: The quarter change was primarily due to decreases in advocacy costs to counter union policy efforts and long-term incentive compensation expense. These quarterly changes were partially offset by increased compensation including severance costs, as described below, health benefit expenses, professional fees and other purchased services. The annual change was primarily due to increases in advocacy costs to counter union policy efforts, compensation expenses, including severance costs, as described below, travel costs, center closure costs, as described below, and higher information technology related costs. These annual increases were partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of our self-developed properties, decreased professional fees and fewer contributions to our charitable foundation.Financial and operating metrics:Three months endedDecember 31,Twelve months endedDecember 31,2022202120222021Cash flow:(dollars in millions)Operating cash flow$ 344$ 530$ 1,565$ 1,931Free cash flow(1)$ 75$ 290$ 817$ 1,133(1)For definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, see the note titled ""Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and related reconciliations beginning on page 16.Three months ended December 31, 2022Year endedDecember 31, 2022Effective income tax rate on:Income from continuing operations23.3 %20.5 %Income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc.(1)38.5 %26.5 %Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc.(1)31.7 %26.1 %(1)For definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, see the note titled ""Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and related reconciliations beginning on page 16.Center activity: As of December 31, 2022, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 245,000 patients at 3,074 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,724 centers were located in the United States and 350 centers were located in 11 countries outside of the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we opened a total of six new dialysis centers and closed 58 dialysis centers in the United States. We also acquired three dialysis centers, opened three dialysis centers and closed eight dialysis centers outside of the United States during the fourth quarter of 2022.Integrated kidney care (IKC): As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 42,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements representing approximately $3.5 billion in annualized medical spend. We also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements; we do not include the medical spend for these patients in this annualized medical spend estimate. See additional description of these metrics at Note 2.Certain items impacting operating results:Closure costs. During 2022, we incurred higher than normal charges for center capacity closures. These closures are the result of a strategic review of our outpatient clinic capacity requirements and utilization, which have been impacted both by declines in our patient census in some markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as by our initiatives toward, and advances in, increasing the proportion of our home dialysis patients.Our fourth quarter charges for U.S. dialysis center closures were approximately $35 million, which increased our patient care costs by $6 million, our general and administrative expenses by $5 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $24 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, charges for U.S. dialysis center closures were approximately $86 million, which increased our patient care costs by $21 million, our general and administrative expenses by $19 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $46 million. These capacity closures costs included net losses on assets retired, lease costs, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and amortization.Severance costs and other. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions. As a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our U.S. dialysis business, IKC business and corporate administration support function of $17.0 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively.International. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we also committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in our international business, which resulted in recognition of expenses related to termination benefits and other charges of $7.5 million.Advocacy costs. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred advocacy costs of approximately $51 million to counter union policy efforts, including a California ballot initiative. These costs are included in the U.S. dialysis segment's general and administrative expense.Outlook:The following forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those described below, and actual results may vary materially from these forward-looking measures. For example, the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to generate significant risk and uncertainty, and as a result, our future results could vary materially from the guidance provided below. We do not provide guidance for operating income or diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita Inc. on a basis consistent with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) nor a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These non-GAAP financial measures do not include certain items, including capacity closure charges, severance costs and foreign currency fluctuations, which may be significant. The guidance for our effective income tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita Inc. also excludes the amount of third-party owners' income and related taxes attributable to non-tax paying entities.2023 expected guidanceLowHigh(dollars in millions, except per share data)Adjusted operating income from continuing operations$1,400$1,600Adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita Inc.$5.45$6.95Free cash flow$650$900We will be holding a conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, on February 22, 2023, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

This compares to earnings of $1.12 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this natural gas distribution would post earnings of $0.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.44, delivering a surprise of 7.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.ONE Gas , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Gas Distribution industry, posted revenues of $818.21 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.09%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $593.74 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.ONE Gas shares have added about 5.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.1%.What's Next for ONE Gas?While ONE Gas has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for ONE Gas: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.91 on $977.12 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.12 on $2.49 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Gas Distribution is currently in the top 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Sempra (SRE), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 28.This natural gas and electricity provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Sempra's revenues are expected to be $3.81 billion, down 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

High oil prices have been the major catalyst pushing energy stocks higher, and there are several factors keeping prices elevated. Inflation, and the increased cost of labor and goods.The Russian - Ukrainian war has raised uncertainty in the European energy market and created trade bans with Russia thus tightening oil supply.Structural shortages of oil production due to underinvestment in energy infrastructure.There are several oil and gas stocks with upward trending earnings revisions giving them high Zacks Ranks scores. Furthermore, according to the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas – Refining and Marketing is in the top 5% (12 out of 251) of industries.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero EnergyValero Energy VLO is a deeply diversified oil refinery company with 15 plants across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean and capacity to refine 3.2 million barrels a day. The majority of VLO’s refinery plants are located in the Gulf Coast with easy access to export facilities, boosting margins. Valero recently reported strong fourth-quarter results with a 13% upside surprise on EPS.VLO has been a top performing stock over the past year, trouncing the returns of the broad market and more than doubling returns of its respective sector. Even after the price of oil peaked back in March 2022, VLO stock is still pushing near its all-time highs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBecause of its strong performance and prospects VLO currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. In the table below, you can estimates across time frames dipped significantly between 90 and 30 days ago. But the estimates have been revised dramatically higher over the last 30 days.Current quarter earnings estimates are projected to jump nearly 200% YoY to $6.90 per share.VLO also has encouraging Zacks Style Scores, earning an A for Value, B for Growth, and A for Momentum.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero Energy currently trades at a one-year forward P/E of 6x, well below its 10-year median of 10x, and in line with the industry's average. Additionally, VLO offers a dividend yield of 3.1%. We can see that although the path of dividend increases has been volatile, it has been increasing over the last two decades.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon PetroleumMarathon Petroleum MPC, is a U.S. based integrated, downstream energy company. MPC operates through two segments, Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation. Refining and Marketing operates 16 refineries with a crude processing capacity of 3 million barrels per day. In 2022 the refining business recorded $16.5 billion in profits. Pipeline transportation, operating as a partnership with Andeavor Logistics transports oil products and manages logistics. It earned $4.5 billion in profits in 2022.Additionally, in 2021, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway retail gasoline business for $21 billion to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; I Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.MPC currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating that earnings expectations are being revised higher. In the chart below we can see that both 2023 and 2024 expectations are clearly trending higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike VLO, MPS has seen the majority of positive revisions happen over the last 30 days. All projections have been revised significantly higher, besides next quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarathon Petroleum is currently trading at 7x one-year forward P/E, which is below its 5-year median of 9x, and just above the industry average 6x. MPC also offers a dividend yield of 2.5%. And MPC has consistently raised its payout, raising its dividends/share from $0.60 per share in 2012, to $2.50 per share today.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPhillips 66Phillips 66 PSX is an oil and gas midstream, chemicals, refining and marketing company. Refining is the primary contributor to the top line, and PSX operates 13 refineries across the U.S. and Europe. Midstream businesses, which focus on transportation and storage of petroleum have been flourishing of late. Considering the lack of energy infrastructure that has taken place over the last decade, many investors have become keen on the sector.PSX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Additionally, the stock earns an A grade across Zacks Style Scores Value, Growth and Momentum. Current quarter sales estimates are projecting a YoY decrease of -4.5% to $35 billion, but earnings are still expected to grow. Current quarter EPS of $3.86 per share would mark a 193% YoY increase.PSX also boasts a very reasonable valuation. The stock is currently trading at a one-year forward P/E of 7x, below its 10-year median of 12x, and just above the industry average of 6x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPSX is also a great dividend stock with a current yield of 4.2%, and a long history of raising dividend payments.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionWe covered what is pushing oil prices higher, but whether these issues will persist is of course unknown. For the time being all these factors are still at play though. A major sell-off in oil prices, or a slowdown in economic output would be a thorn in the bullish energy thesis.Oil and gas stocks have made an epic comeback since the 2020 pandemic era. Oil futures at one point during the depths of Covid traded -$16. It was also a popular narrative that the world would soon be running off entirely alternative energy sources and driving electric cars. While that may be true eventually, oil, gas and other fossil fuels are still the primary sources of energy for the world.Furthermore, as seen in this report, oil and gas companies make for great stocks, with strong business models, reasonable valuations, and generous dividends. Because of these traits, energy stocks make for a great addition to any investor’s portfolio. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The transaction, which is anticipated to close later this year, values the combined company at approximately $305 million-$586 million.

CSP uses mirrors to reflect sunlight onto a receiver, which subsequently absorbs the solar energy as heat in sodium, as opposed to the typical photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, which transform light into electricity. Although the cost of wind and PV solar has greatly declined, their intermittency is a major issue that can only be solved with storage, according to Vast CEO, Craig Wood.The company proposes to construct the utility-scale CSP facility VS1 at Port Augusta in South Australia, which will start operating in 2025.

369,60942f91-0329-3ca0-b545-8954a6a06df7,REG,2023-02-23,This CEO Just Sold Almost $1 Million Worth Of Stock: Is It Significant?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-just-sold-almost-1-153236058.html,1677079956,STORY,['REG'],"[Many investors follow insider transaction news because buying or selling company shares often signals the future direction of a stock. After all, who knows more about a company’s prospects than a high-level executive of that firm?But not all insider transactions are significant, and most of the time insider buys carry more weight than insider sales.Why are insider buys more significant than sells? Because insiders usually only buy stock if they feel strongly that the share price will appreciate. But an insider may sell shares for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the company’s prospects. Like everyone else, company insiders buy new homes, put children through college, pay for weddings and other things that require large sums of money.Recently, a high-level company insider at a real estate investment trust (REIT) sold a large number of shares worth almost $1 million. But is this significant in terms of the future performance of the stock? Take a look:Regency Centers Corp. (NASDAQ: REG) is a Jacksonville, Florida-based retail REIT that owns and operates 404 properties in higher-income areas, mostly on the East Coast of the U.S. Its portfolio includes grocery stores, restaurants, service providers, medical spaces and higher-class retailers.On Feb. 14, President and CEO Lisa Palmer sold 15,180 shares of Regency Centers stock at an approximate price of $65.58 per share for a total of $995,504.40. As required, the sale was disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission and made public.Does this sale portend hard times ahead for Regency Centers? Is the CEO bailing out because her company is faltering? It’s doubtful. Consider the following:The CEO sold her shares after the fourth-quarter operating results were released on Feb. 9. If Regency Centers was in trouble, it’s more likely the sale would have occurred well before the earnings release.The Feb. 10 fourth-quarter earnings report was positive, as the funds from operations (FFO) of $1.05 beat analysts’ estimates of $0.98 by $0.07 and was $0.04 above its $1.01 FFO in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue of $307.62 million beat analysts’ estimates by $12.83 million and was 6% higher than $290.01 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.In its fourth-quarter report, Regency Centers noted that same property already leased of 95.1% and same property newly commenced of 92.6% were significantly above the year-over-year numbers.Story continuesAs CEO Palmer stated:“Our leasing and value creation pipelines are supported by continued robust tenant demand, providing us great momentum into 2023, while our balance sheet strength allows us to remain opportunistic.”On Dec. 12, J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Mueller upgraded Regency Centers from Neutral to Overweight and raised his price target from $70 to $72. Mueller said he had an improved view of strip center REITs and that Regency’s leasing has been “broad-based and robust.” Other analysts have recently raised target prices for Regency Centers as well.Five hedge funds have recently increased their positions in shares of Regency Centers.On Nov. 3, Regency Centers announced an increase in the quarterly dividend, from $0.63 to $0.65 per share. This works out to a 4% annual increase and the forward annual dividend of $2.60 per share now yields 4% on Regency Centers’ recent closing price of $64.33. Raising the dividend is usually a positive signal about the future earnings of a company.Regency Centers announced its next quarterly dividend will continue to be $0.65 per share, payable on April 5 to shareholders as of March 15, with an ex-dividend date of March 14.The technical picture of Regency Center’s chart continues to look positive. The stock has risen from a low near $52 in mid-October to a recent high above $68. The 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average (golden cross) near the end of December and has remained well above it since then. Recent up days have been on greater volume than down days.Palmer still owns 106,000 shares of stock worth approximately $6.95 million, and while it’s always prudent to monitor a stock’s future news, investors may be able to rest easy in this instance about the CEO’s large insider sale.Looking for a way to boost returns?

As we navigate this period of macro uncertainty and non-operational headwinds, we expect healthy demand for our products and services, solid organic growth and sustained operating momentum across our industry leading business segments.”For 2023, management is anticipating the following outlook: 2023 Full Year OutlookOrganic revenue growth for parts and services6.0% to 8.0%Diluted EPS2$3.68 to $3.98Adjusted diluted EPS1,2$3.90 to $4.20Operating cash flowapprox. $1.275 billionFree cash flow1 approx. $975 millionFree cash flow conversion of EBITDA155% to 60%Our outlook for the full year 2023 is based on current conditions and recent trends, and it assumes a global effective tax rate of 26.3%, the prices of scrap and precious metals hold near the December average, and no further deterioration due to the Ukraine/Russia conflict. We have applied foreign currency exchange rates near January average levels, including $1.08 and $1.22 for the euro and pound sterling, respectively. The outlook assumes a $45 million to $55 million increase in annual interest expense relative to 2022. Changes in these conditions may impact our ability to achieve the estimates. Adjusted figures exclude (to the extent applicable) the impact of restructuring and transaction related expense; amortization expense related to acquired intangibles; excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based payments; losses on debt extinguishment; impairment charges; direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict (including provisions for and subsequent adjustments to reserves for asset recoverability and expenditures to support our employees and their families) and gains and losses related to acquisitions or divestitures (including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities).(1)Non-GAAP measure.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$58.96 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$52.63. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether LKQ's current trading price of US$56.33 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at LKQ’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for LKQ Is LKQ Still Cheap?Great news for investors – LKQ is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $72.97, but it is currently trading at US$56.33 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that LKQ’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from LKQ?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -5.2% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for LKQ. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although LKQ is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to LKQ, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LKQ for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Conagra Brands Inc. CAG, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Philip Morris International Inc. PM and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Solid Economic Data Unnerves Investors: 5 Low-Beta PicksU.S. stock markets have seen northbound movement so far this year after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 2.1%, 6.2% and 12.6%, respectively. However, off late, volatility has returned on Wall Street.Several strong economic data and hotter-than-expected inflation rates of January raised concerns that the Fed's tighter monetary control and higher interest rate regime is unlikely to terminate any time soon. Market participants confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent. Volatility is likely to continue in the near term.Strong Economic Data for JanuaryThe nonfarm payrolls for January jumped to 517,000 in January from 260,000 in December. The consensus estimate was 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4% in January from 3.5% in the previous month. The consensus estimate was 3.6%.The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales unexpectedly jumped 3% in January after declining 1.1% in December. The consensus estimate was an increase of 1.7%. The ISM Services Index climbed to 55.2% in January from 49.2% In December. The consensus estimate was 50.6%. Any reading above 50% means an expansion in services activities.Industrial production was unchanged in January after falling 0.6% and 1% in November and December, respectively. Within the overall industrial production, manufacturing and mining output rose 1% and 2%, respectively. The output of utilities fell 9.9% in January due to unseasonably warm weather in January.Story continuesGood Economic Data Bad for Wall StreetStrong economic data has unnerved investors as a higher wage rate will raise aggregate demand, making inflation stubborn. The consumer price Index and the producer price Index of January were reported last week. These two key inflation measures were higher than the consensus mark, indicating that the Fed has to go a long way to tame inflation to near 2%.The fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up further following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He said that he had proposed a 50-basis point rate hike in the Fed's last meeting and such a hike could be expected in the March meeting. Bullard's sentiments were echoed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, saying that she also supports a steeper rate hike in the next meeting, which further weighed on stocks.On Feb 17, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said ""I think there's a long way to go before we reach our 2% inflation objective and I think we'll have to continue to raise the federal funds rate until we see a lot more progress on that.""Fearing a prolonged higher interest rate regime, the ICE dollar index rose 0.25% last week. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note rose 8.4 basis points last week to close at 3.827%.The Dow fell recorded three consecutive weeks of decline. This happened for the first time since September 2022. The S&amp;P 500 posted losses for two successive weeks for the first time in 2023.Stock Selection ProcessAt this stage, we have applied a broad selection criteria. First, we have selected stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care. Second, we have chosen low-beta stocks. Third, high dividend yield stocks have been handpicked. Finally, we have picked stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low- beta will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer staples stocks with low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) and a solid dividend yield. These companies have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Conagra Brands Inc. has been benefiting from its robust pricing actions, which aided the top line in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Results gained from strength in CAG's brands, efficient pricing and the ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook. Conagra Brands delivered improved service and productivity amid ongoing inflationary pressures and industry-wide supply-chain hurdles.Management expects the inflationary landscape to persist in fiscal 2023. Nonetheless, pricing and innovation are likely to aid CAG.

Smoke-free products and RRPs are generating strong revenues.Philip Morris has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.1% and 5.5%, respectively, for the current year.

374,947fc0a6-b60f-3db1-aa6f-cde4fae8d304,PG,2023-02-23,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Procter & Gamble Company (The) (PG) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-procter-gamble-140002595.html,1677074402,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned -1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which P&amp;G falls in, has lost 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 points to a change of +0.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.27 indicates a change of +7.3% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.33 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $80.5 billion and $83.84 billion estimates indicate +0.4% and +4.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.9%. EPS of $1.59 for the same period compares with $1.66 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.81%. The EPS surprise was +0.63%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Adjusted income from operations1 was $90.6 million, compared to $64.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share1 was $0.60, compared to $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $200.2 million, compared to $303.1 million in 2021. Free cash flow2 for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $68.0 million, compared to $186.2 million in 2021.KEY BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS:Grew organic revenues1 5.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, with increases in Secure Information Destruction (“SID”) of 12.2% and Regulated Waste and Compliance Services (“RWCS”) of 2.8%.Generated free cash flow of $68.0 million in 2022, with the fourth quarter of 2022 contributing $130.9 million. Excluding the impact of adjusted litigation payments of $12.3 million in the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $80.3 million in 2022.Improved adjusted income from operations1 370 basis points as a percentage of revenues compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.Reduced our credit agreement defined debt leverage ratio to 3.28X, down 0.33X since December 31, 2021.Achieved adjusted diluted earnings per share1 of $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $0.22 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.Continued to execute on our portfolio optimization initiative in the fourth quarter with the divestiture of our Communication Solutions operations in North America for proceeds of $45.0 million.Story continues“Our fourth quarter performance was in line with our expectations,” said Cindy J. Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer. “With strong second half execution, we made important progress across our key business priorities during a challenging operating year.”Adjusted financial measures are Non-GAAP measures and exclude adjusting items as described and reconciled to comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures in the Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures contained in this Press Release.Free cash flow is calculated as Net cash from operating activities less Capital expenditures.FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) ResultsRevenues in the fourth quarter were $670.4 million, compared to $657.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The $13.1 million increase was primarily due to organic revenue1 growth of $24.5 million in SID, $13.0 million in RWCS and the impact of an acquisition of $2.1 million. Partially offsetting these increases were unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $15.7 million and the impact of divestitures of $10.8 million.Income from operations in the fourth quarter was $59.1 million, compared to $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The $50.9 million increase was primarily due to the following: 2022 commercial pricing levers resulting in revenue flow through of $32.0 million; lower adjusted litigation, settlements and regulatory compliance expenses of $17.8 million; lower bad debt expense of $6.8 million; lower annual incentive compensation expense of $5.0 million; and lower self-insurance expense of $3.4 million. These were partially offset by higher vehicle, wage, and utility-related inflationary costs of approximately $18.3 million.Net income in the fourth quarter was $31.8 million, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, compared to net loss of $17.2 million, or $0.19 diluted loss per share, in the fourth quarter of last year. The difference was related to higher income from operations of $50.9 million, as explained above.Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $200.2 million, compared to $303.1 million in 2021. The year-over-year decline of $102.9 million was primarily driven by the FCPA settlement payments of $81.0 million, timing of vendor payments of $32.3 million, and higher interest payments of $15.6 million. These were partially offset by an improvement in Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) of two days, which translates into approximately $16.0 million and operating and net working capital improvements of approximately $10.0 million.Cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $132.2 million, compared to $116.9 million in 2021. The $15.3 million increase was mainly attributable to the timing of cash payments and operational infrastructure investments.Non-GAAP ResultsFor the fourth quarter of 2022, organic revenues1 grew 5.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, which excludes the impact of divestitures, an acquisition, and foreign exchange rates. In the fourth quarter, organic revenues1 of SID increased 12.2% and RWCS increased 2.8%.Adjusted income from operations1 was $90.6 million, compared to $64.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. As a percentage of revenues, the 370 basis points increase was primarily driven by revenue flow through of approximately 480 basis points; lower bad debt expense of 100 basis points; lower annual incentive compensation expense of 80 basis points; and lower self-insurance expense of 50 basis points. These were partially offset by higher vehicle, wage, and utility-related inflationary costs of approximately 270 basis points.Adjusted diluted earnings per share1 was $0.60, compared to $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the net unfavorable impact from divestitures, an acquisition and foreign exchange rates of $0.01, the favorability was mainly driven by revenue flow through of $0.26; favorable selling, general and administrative items of $0.09; lower self-insurance expense of $0.03; and income taxes and other of $0.03. These were partially offset by higher vehicle, wage, and utility-related inflationary costs of $0.15 and higher interest of $0.03.Free cash flow2 for 2022 was $68.0 million, compared to $186.2 million for 2021. The year-over-year decline of $118.2 million was primarily due to lower cash flow from operations of $102.9 million, which reflects the FCPA settlement payments of $81.0 million, and increased cash paid for capital expenditures of $15.3 million, as explained above. DSO improved seven days sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.Adjusted financial measures are Non-GAAP measures and exclude adjusting items as described and reconciled to comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures in the Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures contained in this Press Release.Free cash flow is calculated as Net cash from operating activities less Capital expenditures.CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATIONStericycle is holding its fourth quarter earnings conference call on Thursday, February 23, 2023, at 8:00 a.m. central time.

When we use words such as “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “may”, “plan”, “will”, “goal”, or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of our management about future events and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include, among others, inflationary cost pressure in labor, supply chain, energy, and other expenses, decreases in the volume of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information collected from customers, the ability to implement the remaining phases of our ERP system, and disruptions resulting from deployment of our ERP system, disruptions in our supply chain, disruptions in or attacks on information technology systems, labor shortages, a recession or economic disruption in the U.S. and other countries, changing market conditions in the healthcare industry, competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries, SOP pricing volatility or pricing volatility in other commodities, foreign exchange rate volatility in the jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, the level of government enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, charges related to portfolio optimization or the failure of acquisitions or divestitures to achieve the desired results, failure to consummate transactions with respect to non-core businesses, the obligations to service substantial indebtedness and comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and notes, rising interest rates or a downgrade in our credit rating resulting in an increase in interest expense, political, economic, and other risks related to our foreign operations, pandemics and the resulting impact on the results of operations, long-term remote work arrangements which may adversely affect our business, supply chain disruptions, disruptions in transportation services, restrictions on the ability of our team members to travel, closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers, changes in the volume of paper processed by our secure information destruction business and the revenue generated from the sale of SOP, weather and environmental changes related to climate change, requirements of customers and investors for net carbon zero emissions strategies, and the introduction of regulations for greenhouse gases, which could negatively affect our costs to operate, the outcome of pending, future or settled litigation or investigations including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign anti-corruption laws, failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, as well as other factors described in our filings with the SEC, including the 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Change$13.1  $57.8 (1)   Components of Change (%) in summation may not crossfoot to the total Change (%) due to rounding.(2)   Organic growth is the change in revenues which includes SOP (sorted office paper) pricing and volume and excludes the impact of an acquisition, divestitures, and foreign exchange.(3)   The comparisons at constant currency rates (foreign exchange) reflect comparative local currency balances at prior period’s foreign exchange rates. Stericycle calculated these percentages by taking current period reported Revenues less the respective prior period reported Revenues, divided by the prior period reported Revenues, all at the respective prior period’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in Revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period. Management believes the use of this measure aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of foreign currency.RECONCILIATION OF U.S. GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED)Table 2-A: THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021(In millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Selling,General andAdministrativeExpenses Income fromOperations Net Income Attributable toCommon Shareholders (c) Diluted Earnings Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures$195.3  $59.1  $31.8  $0.35 Adjustments:       ERP and System Modernization (1) (6.1)  6.1   4.7   0.05 Intangible Amortization (2) (29.3)  29.3   22.7   0.25 Portfolio Optimization (3) (4.2)  (11.4)  (9.4)  (0.10)Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance (4) (4.0)  4.0   3.1   0.03 Asset Impairments (5) (3.5)  3.5   2.6   0.02 Other Tax Matters (6) —   —   —   — Total Adjustments (47.1)  31.5   23.7   0.25 Adjusted Financial Measures (a)$148.2  $90.6  $55.5  $0.60 Depreciation   27.0     Adjusted EBITDA (b)  $117.6     (In millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Selling,General andAdministrativeExpenses Income fromOperations Net (Loss) IncomeAttributable toCommon Shareholders (c) Diluted (Loss)EarningsPer ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures$251.4  $8.2  $(17.2) $(0.19)Adjustments:       ERP and System Modernization (1) (9.2)  9.2   6.9   0.07 Intangible Amortization (2) (28.8)  28.8   23.6   0.26 Portfolio Optimization (3) (2.1)  (10.5)  (11.2)  (0.12)Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance (4) (21.8)  21.8   23.1   0.25 Asset Impairments (5) (6.7)  6.7   6.1   0.07 Other Tax Matters (6) —   —   3.6   0.04 Total Adjustments (68.6)  56.0   52.1   0.57 Adjusted Financial Measures (a)$182.8  $64.2  $34.9  $0.38 Depreciation   28.1     Adjusted EBITDA (b)  $92.3     (In millions, except per share data) Fourth Quarter 2022 Change Compared to Fourth Quarter 2021 Selling,General andAdministrativeExpenses Income fromOperations Net Income (Loss)Attributable toCommon Shareholders (d) Diluted Earnings(Loss) Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures$(56.1) $50.9  $49.0  $0.54 Adjustments:       ERP and System Modernization 3.1   (3.1)  (2.2)  (0.02)Intangible Amortization (0.5)  0.5   (0.9)  (0.01)Portfolio Optimization (2.1)  (0.9)  1.8   — Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance 17.8   (17.8)  (20.0)  (0.22)Asset Impairments 3.2   (3.2)  (3.5)  (0.05)Other Tax Matters —   —   (3.6)  (0.04)Total Adjustments 21.5   (24.5)  (28.4)  (0.32)Adjusted Financial Measures$(34.6) $26.4  $20.6  $0.22 Depreciation   (1.1)    Adjusted EBITDA  $25.3               The following table provides adjustments to Income from Operations categorized as follows:(In millions) Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021Non-Cash Related$17.3 $21.4Cash Related 14.2  34.6Total$31.5 $56.0      Non-cash related adjustments include the following:(In millions) Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Impairments ofIntangibles Divestiture (Gains)Losses, net TotalAdjustments:     Intangible Amortization (2)$29.3 $—  $29.3 Portfolio Optimization (3) —  (15.5)  (15.5)Asset Impairments (5) 3.5  —   3.5 Total Non-Cash Charges$32.8 $(15.5) $17.3            (In millions) Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Impairments of Intangibles Divestiture (Gains) Losses, net TotalAdjustments:     Intangible Amortization (2)$28.8 $—  $28.8 Portfolio Optimization (3) —  (14.1)  (14.1)Asset Impairments (5) 6.7  —   6.7 Total Non-Cash Charges$35.5 $(14.1) $21.4            U.S. GAAP results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include:ERP and System Modernization: In 2022, Selling, General, and Administrative expenses (“SG&amp;A”) includes $6.1 million of consulting and professional fees related to our ERP and system modernization.

For purposes of reconciling adjusted diluted earnings per share with respect to taxes period-over-period, the company utilizes a “rate approach” to highlight the impact of the adjusted tax rate. It is computed by multiplying the prior period adjusted rate by the current period adjusted income before taxes to determine the expected tax expense. Such expected tax expense is then compared to actual tax expense. Expected tax in excess of actual tax variance is favorable; actual tax in excess of expected tax variance is unfavorable. The variance divided by diluted shares outstanding at the end of the period yields the impact on earnings per share. Management believes the use of this measure best aids in explaining the impact of a changing tax rate.Table 2-B: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021(In millions, except per share data)  Year Ended December 31, 2022  Selling,General andAdministrativeExpenses Income fromOperations Net IncomeAttributable toCommon Shareholders (d) Diluted EarningsPer ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures $887.5  $153.7  $56.0  $0.61 Adjustments:        ERP and System Modernization (1)  (19.2)  19.2   14.5   0.16 Intangible Amortization (2)  (124.0)  124.0   96.1   1.04 Portfolio Optimization (3)  (6.9)  (8.7)  (7.4)  (0.08)Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance (4)  (30.0)  30.0   25.1   0.27 Asset Impairments (5)  (5.5)  5.5   4.1   0.04 Other Tax Matters (6)  —   —   —   — Total Adjustments  (185.6)  170.0   132.4   1.43 Adjusted Financial Measures (a) $701.9  $323.7  $188.4  $2.04 Depreciation (b)    108.5     Adjusted EBITDA (c)   $432.2     (In millions, except per share data)  Year Ended December 31, 2021  Selling,General andAdministrativeExpenses Income fromOperations Net (Loss) IncomeAttributable toCommon Shareholders (d) Diluted (Loss)EarningsPer ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures $946.6  $72.3 $(27.8) $(0.30)Adjustments:        ERP and System Modernization  (1)  (59.0)  59.0  44.0   0.47 Intangible Amortization (2)  (117.9)  117.9  92.0   1.00 Portfolio Optimization (3)  (5.0)  3.3  (2.5)  — Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance (4)  (93.2)  93.2  91.8   1.00 Asset Impairments (5)  (6.7)  6.7  6.1   0.07 Other Tax Matters (6)  —   —  (1.9)  (0.02)Total Adjustments  (281.8)  280.1  229.5   2.49 Adjusted Financial Measures (a) $664.8  $352.4 $201.7  $2.19 Depreciation (b)    105.4    Adjusted EBITDA (c)   $457.8    (In millions, except per share data) Year Ended 2022 Change Compared to Year Ended 2021  Selling,General andAdministrativeExpenses Income fromOperations Net Income (Loss)Attributable toCommon Shareholders (d) Diluted Earnings(Loss) Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures $(59.1) $81.4  $83.8  $0.91 Adjustments:        ERP and System Modernization  39.8   (39.8)  (29.5)  (0.31)Intangible Amortization  (6.1)  6.1   4.1   0.04 Portfolio Optimization  (1.9)  (12.0)  (4.9)  — Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance  63.2   (63.2)  (66.7)  (0.73)Asset Impairments  1.2   (1.2)  (2.0)  (0.03)Other Tax Matters  —   —   1.9   0.02 Total Adjustments  96.2   (110.1)  (97.1)  (1.06)Adjusted Financial Measures $37.1  $(28.7) $(13.3) $(0.15)Depreciation    3.1     Adjusted EBITDA   $(25.6)               The following table provides adjustments to Income from Operations categorized as follows:(In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021Non-Cash Related$114.0 $120.8Cash Related 56.0  159.3Total$170.0 $280.1      Non-cash related adjustments include the following:(In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2022 Impairments ofProperty, Plantand Equipment Impairments ofIntangibles Divestiture(Gains) Losses,net TotalAdjustments:       ERP and System Modernization (1)$— $— $—  $— Intangible Amortization (2) —  124.0  —   124.0 Portfolio Optimization (3) —  —  (15.5)  (15.5)Asset Impairments (5) —  5.5  —   5.5 Total Non-Cash Charges$— $129.5 $(15.5) $114.0 (In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2021 Impairments ofProperty, Plantand Equipment Impairments ofIntangibles Divestiture(Gains) Losses,net TotalAdjustments:       ERP and System Modernization (1)$0.6 $— $—  $0.6 Intangible Amortization (2) —  117.9  —   117.9 Portfolio Optimization (3) —  —  (4.4)  (4.4)Asset Impairments (5) —  6.7  —   6.7 Total Non-Cash Charges$0.6 $124.6 $(4.4) $120.8               U.S. GAAP results for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include:ERP and System Modernization: In 2022, SG&amp;A includes $19.2 million of consulting and professional fees related to our ERP and system modernization. In 2021, SG&amp;A includes $59.0 million of expenses related to our ERP and system modernization, of which $41.8 million related to consulting and professional fees, $7.5 million related to software usage/maintenance fees, $7.9 million related to internal costs, and $1.8 million of other related costs.Intangible Amortization: Intangible amortization expense from acquisitions.Portfolio Optimization: Divestitures (Gains) Losses, net in 2022 includes a $15.6 million gain (inclusive of $1.4 million related to deal costs) related to the divestiture of the Communication Solutions business. 2021 includes a $12.6 million gain (inclusive of $1.5 million related to deal costs) related to the divestiture of Environmental Solutions operations in Canada and a $10.9 million loss (inclusive of $1.2 million related to deal costs) related to the divestiture of Japan.

(NASDAQ:AAL)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-american-airlines-group-inc-104118028.html,1677148878,STORY,['AAL'],"[American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at American Airlines Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group What Is American Airlines Group Worth?American Airlines Group appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that American Airlines Group’s ratio of 79.72x is above its peer average of 19.78x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Airlines industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that American Airlines Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of American Airlines Group look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. American Airlines Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? AAL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe AAL should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on AAL for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for AAL, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

It has seen the most growth for two consecutive years due to the impact of both global economic recovery post-pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war in oil markets.Oil companies have prioritized dividends and stock repurchases to appeal to shareholders worried about overproduction. This effective move has served to maintain price momentum. Investors have benefited financially as a result of these decisions.There is a risk of a global recession which could lead to reduced energy demand. There’s also the danger of oil prices staying too high for a long, resulting in decreased demand.Despite this, the oil and gas industry offers plenty of attractive stocks for investors to diversify their portfolios. For example, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) are among the best companies you will find in this sector. All are companies with a strong dividend history and robust operating models.Credit BureausMan calculating finances on calculator. Finance. Finance stocks.Source: wutzkohphoto / ShutterstockInvesting in credit-scoring companies is a safe but often overlooked investment opportunity.Credit scoring companies are responsible for assessing the creditworthiness of individuals and businesses, enabling lenders to make informed decisions about lending and borrowing.Despite this important role in the economy, they have been largely overlooked by investors when it comes to stock market investments.Investing in credit-scoring companies can provide investors with a reliable source of income and exposure to an industry that is not often given enough attention.Credit score has become an integral part of the financial services sector. It is widely used by lenders, investors, and consumers, giving it credibility. Lenders trust the credit scoring system to make important decisions, whereas consumers use it to understand their financial standing.The powerful network effects of this industry give it a monopolistic edge. In the U.S., there are three major credit bureaus – Equifax (NYSE:EFX), Experian (OTCMKTS:EXPGF), and TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) – responsible for providing credit reports.Investing in credit bureaus is not only profitable but also relatively low-risk. Since these companies have been around for decades, they are well-established and have a proven track record of success.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In a recent Q&amp;A with Children's National Hospital, Brad Knox, senior vice president and counsel, Aflac Federal Relations, shared his thoughts on what it means to be an advocate for a cause near and dear to him - children's health. Aflac and Children's National have worked together for more than 10 years, aligning on a common goal: supporting the treatment and research for pediatric cancer and blood disorders.Brad, now a member of the Corporate Advisory Council, began his relationship with Children's National Hospital when one of his own children was treated for an injury. He saw firsthand the level of care they provided for his family and quickly learned about all they do for kids - including the incredible work they do for sickle cell disease patients.""The work Children's National does to ensure that all children in the Washington, D.C., area are healthy and prospering is vital to the families and vibrance of our region,"" said Knox. ""I've also been impressed with their sickle cell research, especially given the diverse population of the community. It's amazing to see the impact locally, nationally, and around the globe.""In 2022, Aflac announced $100,000 donation to Children's National Hospital for research and treatment enhancements for sickle cell disease. This relationship is an extension of Aflac's 27-year and more than $165 million commitment to helping those diagnosed with cancer and various blood disorders, including sickle cell disease. One way Aflac does this is through its My Special Aflac Duck® program, originally created in 2018 for children with cancer and expanded in 2022 with a version for kids with sickle cell. My Special Aflac Duck is a robotic duck that is provided to children above the age of 3, free of charge and helps them cope with their cancer or sickle cell diagnosis and treatments. Children and caregivers use the ducks for medical play to help kids better understand their treatments and communicate their feelings, which is sometimes difficult.Story continues""I am incredibly fortunate to work for a company that is deeply rooted in caring for others and aligns with my personal values,"" said Knox. ""Serving on the Corporate Advisory Council at Children's National is such a privilege and inspiration - meeting with patients and their families and learning about their lives and dreams, their excitement and joy is contagious, and I'm amazed by staff at Children's National who make that future possible for them.""How can you become an advocate for a mission that's important to you? Brad offers a few ways to get started:Be hands-on. Sometimes the best thing you can do is show up and be there for those in need and for your community. Is there a food bank in your area that needs help sorting donations? Or a kids' organization that needs excellent storytellers to read books to neighborhood children? Maybe a nonprofit facility that needs cleaning services? If you are able, there are endless opportunities for hands-on service to organizations in your community. Make it even more fun by gathering a group of friends to volunteer together.Find a local cause and donate. It's simple, but it's also impactful. Find organizations in your area and research what their greatest needs are. While that may look different in each location, it's about giving back and bettering the places you call home. Whether it's a certain dollar amount per month or collection of needed items, give, and give regularly. You can also stretch your contribution further by checking with your employer to see if they offer a donation matching program.Serve. If you want to take your commitment to the next level, are able to commit the time and an opportunity presents itself, consider becoming a board member of your local children's hospital or nonprofit organization. Everyone has a special skill set, and by serving on a board, you get to help shape the future for organizations and the communities they support.Learn more about Aflac's commitment to supporting children with cancer and blood disorders at https://www.aflacchildhoodcancer.org/.Aflac herein means American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus and American Family Life Assurance Company of New York.Aflac | WWHQ | 1932 Wynnton Road | Columbus, GA 31999Z2300074Aflac Incorporated, Wednesday, February 22, 2023, Press release pictureBrad Knox, senior vice president and counsel, Aflac Federal Relations, offers tips for getting involved with the causes you care about.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Aflac Incorporated on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Aflac IncorporatedWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/aflac-incorporatedEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Aflac IncorporatedView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/740335/How-To-Be-an-Ambassador-for-Childrens-Health]"

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 79% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sherwin-Williams. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sherwin-Williams?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Sherwin-Williams does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Sherwin-Williams' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sherwin-Williams. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.2%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.0% and 6.5% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 19 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Sherwin-WilliamsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Sherwin-Williams Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$164m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Sherwin-Williams. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

UHS is set to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 27, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the hospital operator reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.54, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8% due to higher patient admissions at its acute care and behavioral health care facilities. Despite seeing an uptrend, growth in patient volumes in the behavioral health care segment was partly offset by the shortage of nurses and other medical personnel.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $2.96 has witnessed no movement in the past week. The estimate indicates a 0.3% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $2.95 per share.Both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for revenues are pegged at $3.4 billion, suggesting a rise of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Universal Health’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other occasion, the average surprise being 0.7%.

Both segments are likely to have benefited from its continuous expansion initiatives.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for same facility adjusted admissions in acute care hospitals in the fourth quarter hints at an increase of 2.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level, while our estimate suggests 1.8% growth.However, the bottom line of Universal Health is expected to have taken a hit from elevated labor costs. Both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for operating income from Acute Care Hospital Services indicate a 27% year-over-year decline.Higher operating and supplies expenses are expected to have affected margins in the fourth quarter for Universal Health, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Universal Health this time around.

386,a1d028c5-c5ba-3430-a6ed-dd0b611a309c,LNT,2023-02-23,"Utilities Stocks' Q4 Earnings on Feb 23: AEP, PCG & More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/utilities-stocks-q4-earnings-feb-135801095.html,1677074281,STORY,"['PCGU', 'EIX', 'DTE', 'LNT']","[So far, we have witnessed Q4 results, constituting almost 50% of the market cap among the S&amp;P 500 members from the Zacks Utilities sector. Another cohort of major utility stocks, including American Electric Power Company AEP, PG&amp;E Corp. PCG, DTE Energy DTE, Edison International EIX and Alliant Energy LNT, is set to announce their earnings on Feb 23.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-focused utility companies are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Favorable rate revision and customer additions have been creating fresh demand as well as assisting utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure has been allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. These factors are projected to contribute to this sector’s Q4 results.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with the players gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulations pertaining to emissions and the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel have been leading utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.The passage of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a much more predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations and are capital-intensive. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs in 2022 is likely to have pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted Q4 earnings.Story continuesQ4 ExpectationsTotal Q4 earnings of Utility stocks are expected to improve 3.1% year over year, while revenues are likely to have risen 3.1%.For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Utilities' Earnings in FocusLet's take a look at the following utility companies that are scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 23 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcement.American Electric Power delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.91%. During most of the fourth quarter, AEP’s service territories observed fluctuating weather patterns, which are likely to have caused a mixed impact on the company’s overall revenue performance in the to-be-reported quarter.American Electric’s service territories witnessed tornadoes and flash floods in the fourth quarter, which may have caused infrastructural damage, thus increasing the company’s operating expenses for storm restoration and repair. This, in turn, is likely to have weighed on the company’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter (read more: What's in Store for American Electric in Q4 Earnings?)According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

PEP reported on Feb 8.  Both giants came up with upbeat earnings, auguring well for the consumer staples sector. Let’s delve a little deeper.Coca-Cola: Mixed Earnings; Upbeat ViewThe Coca-Cola Company reported better-than-expected top-line results for fourth-quarter 2022, while the bottom line was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed our estimates in the quarter.Comparable earnings of 45 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago period. Meanwhile, comparable earnings surpassed our estimate of 44 cents. Revenues of $10,125 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,005 million and improved 7% year over year. Revenues also beat our estimate of $9,603.7 million.Organic revenues rose 15% from the prior-year quarter thanks to higher prices. The beverage company said its unit case volume, which strips out the impact of currency and price changes, fell 1%. In the reported quarter, Coca-Cola gained a global value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.Coca-Cola’s U.S. business is still performing well despite high inflation and the reopening of China will likely favor sales this year. For 2023, Coke projects comparable revenue growth of 3% to 5% and comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5%. Wall Street was forecasting revenue growth of 3.9% and earnings per share growth of 3% for the year, as quoted on CNBC.PepsiCo: Solid Earnings; Strong ViewPepsiCo reported robust fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein revenues and earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year.

Core EPS also increased 9.2% year over year. Net revenues of $27,996 million improved 10.9% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,849 million and our estimate of $26,347.5 million.Story continuesOn an organic basis, revenues grew 15% year over year.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for aflibercept 8 mg for treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy. The FDA target action date is June 27, 2023 following the use of a priority review voucher.The BLA is supported by positive data from two pivotal trials – PULSAR in wAMD and PHOTON in DME – that were previously presented at the 55th Annual Scientific Session of The Retina Society in November 2022. In both trials, patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg (PULSAR n=673; PHOTON n=491) met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority in vision gains for both the 12- and 16-week dosing regimens after initial monthly doses at 48 weeks compared to patients treated with an EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection (PULSAR n=336; PHOTON n=167) 8-week dosing regimen. Additionally, the vast majority of patients randomized to aflibercept 8 mg in both trials were able to maintain the 12- and 16-week dosing regimens to which they were respectively initiated through 48 weeks (wAMD: 79% and 77%; DME: 91% and 89%). The safety profile for aflibercept 8 mg was similar to EYLEA in both trials, and consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials. Comparing aflibercept 8 mg to EYLEA, ocular adverse events occurred in 31% (n=491) versus 28% (n=167) in PHOTON and 38% (n=673) versus 39% (n=336) in PULSAR, and there were no cases of retinal vasculitis, occlusive retinitis or endophthalmitis in either trial.Story continuesAflibercept 8 mg is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA and future sales of aflibercept 8 mg following any regulatory approvals.Aflibercept 8 mg is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Aflibercept 8 mg Trial ProgramPHOTON in DME and PULSAR in wAMD are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: aflibercept 8 mg every 12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks.Patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 5 initial monthly doses in PHOTON and 3 in PULSAR. In the first year, patients in the aflibercept 8 mg groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study, with those results still to be assessed. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.The lead sponsors of the trials were Regeneron for PHOTON and Bayer for PULSAR.About DME and wAMDDME is a common complication in eyes of people living with diabetes. DME occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damaged blood vessels in the eye that leak fluid into the macula. This can lead to vision loss and, in some cases, blindness. Of the nearly 28 million American adults living with diabetes, an estimated 1.2 million have DME.wAMD is a retinal disease that may affect people as they age. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and leak fluid under the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision and seeing fine detail. This fluid can damage and scar the macula, which can cause vision loss. An estimated 1.1 million Americans have wAMD, and this number is expected to double by 2050.IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONSEYLEA (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).CONTRAINDICATIONSEYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSIntravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.In infants with ROP, reactivation of abnormal angiogenesis and tortuosity may occur following treatment with EYLEA. Infants should be monitored closely after injection with EYLEA until retinal vascularization has completed or until the examiner is assured that reactivation of ROP will not occur. Treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring and additional EYLEA injections and/or laser treatments may be necessary.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.In pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA the most common adverse reactions (≥4%) reported were retinal detachment, conjunctival hemorrhage, and intraocular pressure increased. Adverse reactions established for adult indications are considered applicable to pre-term infants with ROP, though not all were observed in the clinical studies.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.For more information, please see full Prescribing Information.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Otherwise, they would have to go outside to a doctor or another location on their personal time. They thank us, saying ‘It helps us to focus our energies on what we have to do, and that's to protect the city.' ""Antonio LucianoTerritory Manager, Patient ServicesThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors, nurses, police officers, and other first responders have been called heroes, but most will say they are simply doing the jobs they love. At Quest Diagnostics, we agree with both sentiments: they are heroes, every day-before, during, and after the pandemic. And Quest is doing our part in helping New York's finest to safely remain on or return to the job protecting New Yorkers.""When the [virus] was really raising its ugly head, we didn't know much about it,"" explained Antonio Luciano, Territory Manager, Patient Services, overseeing Quest's New York Metro and Long Island patient service centers. ""The CDC had commissioned a study [that included] the City of New York. The purpose of the study was to offer a serology test to all the frontline workers and civil servants, so the CDC could begin to study the effects of the virus.""Antonio noted that his team was tasked with providing serology testing for New York first responders and public safety personnel to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies and assess associations between occupational exposures to the virus and previous infection. Study participation was voluntary and included police, firefighters, correctional staff, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, nonhospital doctors, nurses, phlebotomists, and more.Antonio's team was responsible for testing members of the New York Police Department (NYPD) in just 3 weeks. Due to the Quest team's success with the serology project, they were later asked to provide COVID-19 PCR testing for the NYPD overall.Story continuesQuest soon set up 6 PCR testing sites in strategic locations in NYPD's network of precincts, including at 1 Police Plaza where the police leadership works. Quest also contributed to the graduation of 800 new police recruits at Madison Square Garden. Everyone who was participating needed to receive a negative PCR test within 72 hours of the ceremony. Quest facilitated testing for all attendees, including all recruits, NYPD leadership, and dignitaries.Regarding the vaccination mandates that were in place at that time, Antonio explained, ""NYPD officers who received medical or religious exemptions from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination have a testing option every week. Quest supports those officers who have an exemption to get them cleared so that they can get back to work.""No matter what our role at Quest, we always remember that behind every test is a person, and many are everyday heroes.Read more.Quest Diagnostics , Wednesday, February 22, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Quest Diagnostics on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Quest Diagnostics Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/quest-diagnosticsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Quest DiagnosticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/740359/Bringing-COVID-19-Testing-to-New-Yorks-First-Responders]"

396,1515bed3-ad77-37bd-8086-04bac0eee646,CSCO,2023-02-23,What Makes Cisco (CSCO) a New Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-cisco-csco-buy-stock-170005542.html,1677085205,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Cisco basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Cisco imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for CiscoFor the fiscal year ending July 2023, this seller of routers, switches, software and services is expected to earn $3.72 per share, which is a change of 10.7% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cisco. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.4%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Cisco to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
