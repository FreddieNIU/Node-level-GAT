The reason for their rising popularity is simple: ETFs provide an easy and cost-effective way to gain exposure to certain themes or segments of the market. Although these investing vehicles rarely deliver explosive gains like some stocks, they are inherently less risky because of their diversification factor. Investors, in turn, can rest easy owning a handful of ETFs.', 'How can you make the most of ETF investing? The answer to this question will ultimately depend on your personal financial goals and investing style. But one proven and straightforward strategy is to own a basket of ETFs that provide exposure to the main areas of value creation in the market. More specifically, you can buy three funds that cover large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. Combining these three funds with a handful of low-risk bond funds should deliver returns either on par or superior to the broader market over the long term.', 'Which funds are optimal for this strategy? Below is a nuts-and-bolts overview of three ETFs that screen as some of the best performers in their respective categories.', 'The Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHG) is an ETF that invests in large-cap U.S. companies with strong growth potential. It tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index, which selects companies based on characteristics such as sales and earnings growth. The SCHG sports an extremely low expense ratio of 0.04%, which is 95.8% lower than the category average. This Charles Schwab large-cap growth ETF also offers a modest yield of 0.43%.', 'Since its inception in 2009, the SCHG has delivered total returns (before taxes and assuming the distribution was reinvested) of 650%. For reference, the Vanguard counterpart to the SCHG, known as the Vanguard Growth Index Fund, delivered total returns of 602% over the same period. Both of these U.S. large-cap funds outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the past 13 years.', 'The iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: IMCG) is an ETF that invests in mid-cap U.S. companies that are expected to grow their earnings faster than the broader market. It tracks the Morningstar Mid Growth Index, which holds shares of companies with above-average growth potential. The IMCG has an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.06%, which is 87% lower than the category average. It also offers a modest yield of 0.9%.', 'This mid-cap fund has been one of the best performers in its category since its inception in 2004. Speaking to this point, the IMCG has delivered excess returns relative to both the Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund and the S&P 500 over the prior 19 years.', ""The Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (NYSEMKT: AVUV) is an ETF that invests in small-cap U.S. companies that screen as undervalued by the fund's managers. Unlike the other two funds discussed above, the AVUV is an actively managed fund. Its performance benchmark is the Russell 2000 Value Index."", 'However, this fund does not track a specific underlying index. The AVUV has an expense ratio of 0.25%, which is extremely low for an actively managed fund. Since its inception in 2019, it has markedly outperformed both the Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index and the S&P 500.', 'And despite being a small-cap fund, the AVUV still sports a fairly generous yield of 1.83%. The AVUV thus offers a compelling mix of income, low fees, and above-average performance.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Schwab Strategic Trust-Schwab U.s. Large-Cap Growth ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Schwab Strategic Trust-Schwab U.s. Large-Cap Growth ETF, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Schwab Strategic Trust-Schwab U.s.

If you want to read about some more stocks to buy as interest rates remain high, go directly to 5 Biggest Stocks That Benefit From High Interest Rates.\xa0', 'The central bank in the United States has indicated that it will begin a massive change in monetary policy heading into the next year as inflation numbers cool and confidence grows about a soft landing for the economy. In the final meeting of the year, the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged for the third straight month, with officials even signaling that rate cuts might be on the horizon in 2024. Fed chief Jerome Powell pointed to strong growth numbers, a comeback in the labor market, and progress on inflation as some of the reasons for optimism.\xa0', 'News platform Fox Business reports that Federal Open Market Committee officials expect rates to fall to 4.6% by the end of 2024. This forecast envisions at least three rate cuts next year, each a quarter point. This policy will continue into 2025 and 2026. Even though some experts predict that the Fed may start cutting rates as early as March next year, others have more moderate expectations. For example, Kathy Bostjancic, the chief economist at financial services firm Nationwide, expects rate cuts to begin by May.\xa0', 'Higher interest rates are good for companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), who benefit from higher earnings on consumer and business loans, effectively increasing their revenues overnight. In a higher interest rates environment, rates rise across the board, from mortgages, to credit card debt, to auto loans. Over the past year-and-a-half, interest rates have climbed at a pace not seen in nearly fifty years.\xa0', 'However, investors should keep in mind that this is a gradual process. Even though inflation numbers are cooling, the prices of consumer items remain 3% above what they were last year. The prices of basic necessities like food, healthcare, and rent have all gone up in the past year and show no signs of slowing down. It will likely be a few months before the rate cuts promised by the Federal Reserve are announced. It will then take at least two years or more for the economy to fully stabilize following these cuts.\xa0\xa0', 'In this overall situation, even as rate cuts begin, investments in companies that benefit from rising interest rates are expected to return handsome profits. This is because these companies have diverse revenue streams and long-term plans in place for growth that shield them from macroeconomic volatility. One example of this is Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), whose CEO Jane Fraser, said during the third quarter earnings call that the firm was a bank for all seasons because of ample liquidity and a diversified earnings base for clients.\xa0', '“In terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past 5 years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection. Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% and which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100 bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buyback quarter by quarter, and I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board.”', 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that benefit when interest rates are high and have received positive analyst coverage were selected for the list. Businesses operating in the finance and insurance sector were preferred. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

For instance, corporate fundraising, institutional trading, and wealth management aren't major profit centers for U.S. Bank. This limits its revenue and earnings growth prospects, particularly when the economy is firing on all cylinders."", ""Yet in many ways, a simpler suite of product and service offerings is advantageous to U.S. Bancorp's investors. Primary among that -- the bank can better focus on doing the things it does (like consumer lending) well. And its results are more predictable because they're less cyclical."", ""That's what the graph below shows us. While the subprime mortgage meltdown and the COVID-19 pandemic clearly undermined its top and bottom lines, it's also clear that U.S. Bancorp quickly recovered from both and got back on its long-standing growth track. Not every bigger banking outfit can say the same."", ""Boring? A little. But that's the point -- if you're going to be sitting on a stock for many years, you want to be able to count on the underlying company's progress. U.S. Bancorp reliably logs it, even if never at tremendous speed. And shareholders collect decent dividends all the while.

Although new variants continue to surface, and a seasonal surge in new cases is underway, demand for vaccines and treatments is waning. Pfizer's third-quarter revenue fell 42% year over year, with slumping sales of the company's COVID products responsible for the entirety of that dip. Don't be surprised to see this weakness linger at least a little while longer."", ""Just don't tarry too long if you're considering eventually opening a new position in Pfizer stock. The current quarter should be the last one to show a major year-over-year sales tumble due to people's fading concerns about the virus.

These are all blockbuster drugs, but they haven't realized their full potential yet because of the pandemic. Never even mind its pipeline, where you'll find sickle cell disease treatment Oxbryta, multiple myeloma therapy Elranatamab, and hemophilia drug Marstacimab. All told, Pfizer believes its current pipeline could be producing $20 billion worth of annual revenue by 2030, contributing to up to $84 billion worth of annual companywide sales that year thanks to its recent acquisition of Seagen.

But now that they are getting respectful of that, they're in a much better position and those are the companies that I think will continue to be."", ""Mary Long: I'm Mary Long and that's Tim Beyers, a lead advisor here at the Fool. I caught up with Tim and fellow Fools, Tim White and Alicia Alfieri in Denver earlier this month for a live member event. At that event, we hosted a round table conversation about the state of tech investing. Today, we're sharing with you some snippets from that discussion. I hope you enjoy Fools."", 'Alicia Alfiere: We posed this question about whether tech investing is dead. Then last month, all three major stock indexes were up and the Nasdaq led that charge, it was up point 10.7%. Tim White, maybe we start with you. Why are we even asking this question of whether tech investing is debt at all?', 'Tim White: Sure. In the last couple of years, a lot of the recommendations that we had at the Fool, and certainly a lot of the biggest stocks were tech companies. That was because there was this explosion of tech companies trying to be ""disruptors"". I\'m doing air quotes for those in the podcast. What those disruptors were trying to do is completely change a market with technology. That led to an enormous amount of money flooding into tech companies from both private investors but also big funds and companies like SoftBank, Masayoshi Son, just dumping money into WeWork and Uber and companies like that. Valuation skyrocketed, a lot of us put a lot of money in those. That money is not as much as it was back in 2021, for example. A lot of people have been asking us, is tech investing dead? Should we be putting all of our money back into Exxon and Shell instead of tech companies? We wanted to really talk about why it\'s tough to be a tech company right now and whether we should keep putting our money into tech companies or not.', ""Mary Long: The answer to this might be obvious, but Tim & Alicia, let's kick it to you next. Is tech investing dead? Should we keep putting our money into those companies?"", 'Tim Beyers: Certainly, but you want to be discerning. I think one of the features to build on what Tim said, it\'s something I heard from a Sequoia Capital managing partner, 20 years ago and Doug Leone, he was the guy at Sequoia for a little while, he\'s retired now. But he told me straight to my face, he said,"" Money makes companies stupid and it also makes people stupid."" I think he\'s exactly right. You\'ve had a period for the last, let\'s say 20 years before, was it March 2022 when interest rates started going up? Right up until that point, you had a period of excess whereby there were a lot of dumb companies. I frankly should have been a lot more discerning with some of these companies throughout 2020 and early 2021. I frankly just did not internalize that lesson and use it to have a more focused lens in 2021. It\'s not dead, but I do think it is more important than it\'s been in a while to be discerning with the kinds of tech companies and also for that matter, kick it to you here, what are we talking about, when we\'re talking about a tech company? Like you could be talking about a company that is a really smart user of technology and is changing their operations fundamentally. A good example of that that we could maybe talk a little bit more about later would be Walmart. Walmart\'s an outstanding user of technology, but would you classify Walmart as a tech company? I wouldn\'t, and it certainly doesn\'t get a tech company valuation. But the boy is a smart user of enterprising software engineering.', ""Alicia Alfiere: Yeah. Tim, I really love your comment that money could make companies stupid. I think we have seen examples of that in the past. I think the benefit of going through this bare market, this difficult time, has been that companies have really shifted their focus from growth at any cost to really looking at things that we get excited about, like gaining operational efficiencies, free cash flow, being able to sustain the business yourself instead of going after debt. These are things that are important and we'll set the companies up for the long term and I think we've really seen that happen."", ""Mary Long: Tim, you mentioned like looking back and feeling as though you weren't as discerning as you would like. Are there companies that any of you have watched over this period of, let's say the last maybe four years, and get a bit of variety in there that have been discerning even when all others were not, and that did a really good job of managing their cash and were able to read the moment for what it was?"", ""Tim White: Sure, I'll go first and I'll say Apple, a 100%. Like Apple did not go crazy, they kept doing what they were doing pretty much. If you looked back at what they did, you'd had no idea what was happening in the world, based on what Apple was doing."", ""Tim Beyers: I would say there are companies of the ones that I followed. There are have learned the lesson and maybe some that have learned the lesson a little earlier. I wish the Salesforce had learned the lesson a little bit earlier, but I will say they did it in two stages. The first thing they stopped was acquisitions at scale and then once they stopped that and really started focusing, I would say the last year have been the poster company for 2023 is the year of operational efficiency. They have crushed it. It's really been impressive to see the transformation, because usually that does not happen. It usually requires, I don't want to get too sports ball here, but usually what ends up happening is you switch the coach and then once you switch the coach, you get a new style of play and that new style of play leads you into something new and different. You would expect that what ends up happening is well, Marc Benioff's got to go and we need somebody else to come in and do that but that's not been the case. Being able to internalize that and then turn it around has been impressive to watch."", 'Alicia Alfiere: Well, and sometimes I think you need almost an inciting incident to get some companies to change their strategy, right? We saw recently with Coupang, previously burning cash, they had some difficulties with the bear market. Their share price went down and they started really refocusing, shifting their strategy, and for the last, I think it was four quarters, they actually generated cash for the first time, which was pretty exciting. But sometimes they need that inciting incident to get them started.', ""Mary Long: The second half of the lengthy detailed title that I listed off is until interest rates drop and so the Fed still meets again this year. There's a number of expectations about what will happen then. How do you view this moment going forward? I'm not asking you to say whether the Fed is going to cut rates or whether they're going to stay, we can stay away from that. But assuming that this is peak of the interest rate hike period, what are your expectations moving forward? Is there really a question, or a worry of potential death down the road for certain companies, for certain industries, what have you, or is actually more of a buying opportunity where we're going to know which companies are able to handle their cash, and in an environment where money is not as free flowing and it's harder to come by?"", ""Tim Beyers: I'm going to give you an answer you're going to hate."", 'Alicia Alfiere: Yeah. [laughs]', ""Tim Beyers: But, it's true, because two things can be true at the same time. The answer is yes. Will you see deaths? Yeah. Will you see opportunities? Both things can be true. Here's the problem, is that we were talking about this yesterday, the cost of capital has gone up. It's gone up significantly, and that is important. Let's talk about what we mean when we talk about the cost of capital. The cost of capital is you have the cost of debt, and you have the cost of equity, and a lot of companies, particularly in the tech sector, use a lot of equity. You've probably heard us talk about it. If you listen to Motley Fool Live, you've probably. I hate to do this in an audio program, Mary, so I'm sorry, but we're going to get a show of hands."", 'Mary Long: Oh no.', ""Tim Beyers: How many times have you heard us talking about, you know the phrase I'm going to use, stock-based compensation. How many times have you heard us talking about this? How many hands? Basically, everyone."", 'Mary Long: Let the record show there are a number of hands.', ""Tim Beyers: A number of hands in the air. When you're doing that, if you're a tech company, that is using the most expensive capital that you can use to grow, which is equity. Equity is far more expensive than debt. Then the pressure on those companies to grow and grow quickly, in order to outperform the cost of the expensive capital they're using is extreme, and that puts a lot of pressure on these companies. What do you do in that situation? Well, there's a couple of things you could do. One of them is you could ratchet down your growth plans a little bit, and that is something we've seen. We've seen like reductions in forecasts, we've seen that. We've also seen some real focus on levering down your costs. We've seen that too. Lowering your debt exposure. There's lots of things you can do. But in an environment like even if interest rates freeze where they are right now, the cost of capital is still elevated. The pressure is still on, it hasn't gone away. It's just a little bit less than it used to be. Ultimately though, I feel like I'm ranting, I'm not trying to rant. What I'm saying is that the cost of capital is elevated, it's going to stay elevated. Companies that are respectful of that. I just gave you, Salesforce as an example of a company that is respectful of that, which is a weird thing to say because they used to be the ultimate disrespector of that. But now that they are getting respectful of that, they're in a much better position, and those are the companies that I think will continue to be in a good position."", ""Tim White: I think the thing to think about is that not only is the cost of capital high, but as an investor, you can put your money in things that give you 5-7% interest rate now with no risk. Whereas equity investing has risk. As soon as those interest rates go down, people are looking for a place to put their money that's getting that type of return, even if it has a little more risk. Right now part of the reason money gets sucked out of the market, is it there's safer places to put it than equities. Part of the reason you've seen a raise recently is people are predicting if interest rates go down, they're going to need to get in now, while prices are low on these equities, before they start skyrocketing."", ""Tim Beyers: Money starts flowing into the equity market. When money flows in, that's when equity prices start to rise, right?"", ""Alicia Alfiere: Yeah. Well, and I would say too that as we've had this difficult time in the tech market, you have had valuations go down, and if you do have a company that's shifting their focus, doing the things that they should be doing with the valuation being down, it could be an opportunity. It really depends on the company though. You always have to exercise caution."", ""Mary Long: Tim B, you opened up talking about Stripe private company. We've seen in past recent weeks, I feel like some stories haven't made the news as prominently as other news stories, but there's been a number of private companies that have filed for bankruptcy that previously were just flush with cash. How do the private markets look to whatever eye you have into that? How do private markets, venture markets look right now compared to what we're seeing play out publicly?"", ""Tim Beyers: It's terrifying. I really would not want to be an investor in particular in late stage private market tech. That's an illiquid market and so the valuations don't reset easily, and usually, I know I'm oversimplifying here, but in the private market, a private company valuation is essentially a handshake agreement. What do you want to sell me your equity at? I would like a pre-money valuation of $150 million. Will you take that? No. How about 125? It ends up being a handshake agreement, and then you have investors who pile in around that pre-money and post-money valuation. Resetting is like new rounds of money, and nobody wants to go through what's called a down round. In other words, I have to raise more money because I burned a bunch of cash, but I can't raise it. Let's say I had a $10 billion of private market valuation. I need to raise more money, and in order to raise more money to attract a venture capitalists, they're not going to give me a $10 billion valuation. At most they're going to pay seven billion. That's what they're going to value me at. If I want money, I'm going to have to mark my equity down. Guess who hates that? The existing investors."", 'Tim White: Yeah, everybody, who already bought it.', ""Tim Beyers: Everybody who's already in. I think because of those valuations, and it's in a liquid market is so extreme that it means that, man see it led me into a downer. But I think the positive side of this is the IPO market for 2024 in tech is probably not going to thaw very much. Probably not. Having said that, I do think there's going to be a real opportunity in public market tech."", ""Tim White: Right. For companies that haven't been saddled with all this expensive private money where you've got multiple VC firms competing to see who can give you the most money, and then they end up valuing the company that is way more than it actually is worth, and it can't go public because there's not an appetite for very expensive IPO's anymore. That environment means that you're going to have to have companies either wait for an appetite for expensive IPO's again, which will probably happen. It happened in 2000, it happened in 2020. That could happen or they have to figure out some way to get those investors to let go before they go public."", ""Tim Beyers: Yeah, and to your question Mary, that's where you're going to see some companies heartbreakingly are going to go away. Venture investors tend not to just kill companies, what they do is they tend to neglect companies. Those companies tend to raise more money, they need more capital, and the VCs say sorry, you're on your own, and then that ends into a slow descent into the ditch. But like I said, the good news here is that like vertical software companies, we've talked about vertical software companies, for example, small cap tech, where it's not saddled with the same anchor. That is probably a pretty decent opportunity, honestly. It's probably outperforms private market tech for the next 3-5 years. That's not me saying that, that was a partner at Benchmark that said that on Patrick O'Shaughnessy's podcast, Invest Like the Best, which is another really good one."", 'Alicia Alfiere: Well, and two, I think just to add some context, there is still venture capital activity happening here.', 'Tim Beyers: No question.', ""Alicia Alfiere: It's just a lot lighter than it has been in the past, and there still has been a fair amount of money being filtered to healthcare, for example, and also what we're going to talk about, I think later, the AI. A fair amount of money there too."", ""Tim Beyers: Yeah, and to be clear, early stage venture investing is still as robust as it ever has been. But that late stage, because there were a lot of fear, it was basically an arbitrage. Late stage, lots of venture investors, angel investors piling in saying, so let me give you an example. I want to get in on Snowflake before it goes public and get the best deal possible. People are just piling in at like a valuation that was just extreme knowing that when it came out it would come out at an even more extreme valuation. That's just not true anymore. But at the seed stage, yes, it's still very vibrant and there's a lot of money flowing in."", 'Mary Long: After talking about artificial intelligence and making some reckless predictions about the future of attach in Colorado, we handed the mike to audience members so that then Tim and Alicia could answer questions about Twilio, Datadog and Tesla.', ""Carl Kolesnikov: Hi, my name's Carl Kolesnikov. I wanted to ask you specifically about Twilio. Does Twilio fit into that same situation that Salesforce was in with regards to how they've managed their money over time?"", 'Tim White: We wish that was the case.', ""Tim Beyers: Yeah, we really do. I'll start here and then either of you kick in here. Thanks Carl. They just did a 5% layoff. The lousy thing is, it's been a bit of a drip, drip, drip. I've been waiting for them to get past the point where they have stabilized the business such that there's no more drip, drip, drip. Yet here we are just again this week with another five percent off. If you can, I would encourage you, the SEC has all of the filings and there's an eight k from Thursday, and in that eight k is Jeff Lawson who is a CEO and co-founder, his letter to employees about this layoff. In it, what it says is that they couldn't figure out, go to market for the new product, the segment product. They just weren't getting enough uptake on it. They've gone back to selling the newer products by bundling it with the old product, the communications product, which makes sense. It means that there are salespeople that they hired in order to sell segment, the new product. They had engineers and support staff to support segment. Those people are getting laid off. Because I own so much Twilio, I want them so badly to figure this out, but I just can't tell you that they have figured this out yet, but I'm hoping. Because the core technology is still very good and tons of people still use it. Anything you want to add?"", ""Tim White: I will say that they did have a similar story where they did a lot of acquisitions, Denver-based Engrid, Denver located Segment. A lot of businesses they bought, they've paused all that and they're still trying to figure out how to integrate it now, which is good news. But integrating acquisitions is extremely difficult."", ""Tim Beyers: It's very hard."", ""Tim White: It's something they've really struggled with. I think maybe next year ask us again, Carl, where we're at with that and hopefully it'll be a better answer."", ""Tim Beyers: Every quarter, here's what I'm looking for. If we could get through two quarters of stabilized no layoffs and then some improvements that show up in rising operating margins, and so you actually don't have to scale up your sales and marketing spend in order to grow your revenue number and that shows up as improved operating margins, that'd be a great sign. That would really be something I'd love to see. I think the stock would respond if they did that."", ""Alicia Alfiere: Now it's on the record, so we can have someone check back in a year from now."", ""Tim White: Well, we make predictions every single week and we regularly revisit them and go, we had it, but most of the time we're like, what were we thinking? But the advantage of making predictions every week is it keeps you thinking about the future and that is important."", ""Carl Kolesnikov: Even though Datadog is not headquartered here in Colorado, they have an office just around the corner. I have a daughter that has worked there and I'm just curious, are they the type of company they keep adding more of these modules and is their future bright?"", 'Tim Beyers: You want to start?', ""Tim White: I'm just going to say what I talked about, preset license cost optimization applies to Datadog. I do believe that they will be subject to some headwinds there because it is a very expensive product. As you said, they're always adding modules which makes the product more expensive for companies. Open source tech, which Tim and I talk about a lot about competing with this, in the case of open telemetry and some other open source bits are competing with Datadog in a way they weren't three years ago. I do think that there's some headwinds there. On the other hand, Datadog has a lot of very happy customers. I use it literally every day in my job to try to figure out what's going on with our text. It's a great product, I think that they've got a good strategy. I think they've kept their cost is reasonable and there's still a lot of SBC, but generally kept things reasonable. I think their future is bright, but there may be some pivots in order to deal with some of this as headwinds."", ""Tim Beyers: I think that's exactly right and they've been open about this, Tim. They have said that we have a lot of customers that are coming to us and they are quite literally, they used the term Cost Optimization in the earnings calls. They have customers who are coming in and saying, this bill is too big, we need to find ways to cut it. That is cutting into the growth a little bit. I think that is fair and expected and it would be weird if that wasn't happening, especially with the assault of open source on this. Open telemetry is a pretty darn good product. Now, having said that, man, they are delivering like they are growing their customer base. For the existing customers that have actually committed to Datadog, they're growing their usage slower than they used to certainly. But they're still growing their usage over time, which is great to see. You don't mind. At least if you're me, I don't mind when a company that comes under increased competitive pressure or you run into economic headwinds and the CIO says, you know what? Tim, I see this bill. This bill is 800 grand. I need you to get it down to 600 grand. Then Tim says, well, here's the good thing that I take from it. He says there's zero chance that I am unplugging this, so I'll get it to 600 grand. That's a good sign."", ""Tim White: It's still solving a migraine-level problem. It just may be that I don't want to pay that much of the Aspen."", ""Tim Beyers: That's why I still own it and still really like it."", 'Male: My name is V.B.', 'Tim Beyers: Hi.', ""Male: We talked so much about AI, but we didn't talk about Tesla."", ""Tim Beyers: That's true."", 'Male: Can you complete the story?', ""Tim White: Do you want us to talk about Tesla's AI ambition specifically?"", 'Male: Yeah.', ""Tim White: Sure. Elon a big investor in Open AI in the beginning and wanted to run it himself as he does all things, and really wanted to push for it. He could never convince the Open AI board and Sam to build the AI that he wanted, and in the same way that he wants to make Twitter the way he wants to make it. He's built his own, he's got a lot of money raised for it. He'll probably raise a lot more to build an alternative AI. I think this plays exactly into what Tim was saying about when you have a big free tier, you're competing $0 for everybody. There's no switching costs, I can try one today, a different one tomorrow, another one the third day, and I can use all of them. What you often see software developers do is play this game of, I will use until I hit the free tier so they don't have to pay again, and they just keep going sideways and using as many as possible. Are there going to be people who love Tesla's AI and use it? I'm sure. On the other hand, it's an incredibly competitive landscape. I don't expect them to be a crusher right away out the gate."", ""Tim Beyers: Having said that, I'll take a side step of that, a different version of what Tim just said because I agree with all of that. The other piece of it, though, is that, if you were to think about the best datasets for AI that exists in the world today, it would be very difficult to think of a better dataset than is in possession at Tesla. It's an astounding dataset because of all of the miles driven by Tesla's and all of the monitoring that they have done. Now, I need to qualify that and say they haven't used that dataset yet to get to full self driving. I don't know exactly what the problem is there, but in terms of software engineering, I think one of the things we know, and Tim knows this better than I do, it is very difficult to create a perfect product. You still end up with errors that appear out of absolutely nowhere. The consequences of an unknown error in full self driving are just unthinkable, you just can't have them. Because of that, even though the dataset is absolutely astounding and I think the AI that's built around that dataset is incredible and probably is going to deliver lots of really amazing things. It's not clear to me, [inaudible] , that it can deliver full self driving in the way that I know Tesla is promising it will."", 'Tim White: That said, a lot of extremely talented engineers between Tesla and SpaceX.', 'Tim Beyers: One hundred percent.', ""Alicia Alfiere: We touched on this before. I think autonomous driving, full self driving, is a lot more complex than people realized. Not only do you have all of these different kinds of roads to worry about, you have something that I think a computer would have a hard time figuring out that is, human drivers to have to interact with. That's the most dangerous part of getting to autonomous driving, is the part where it's humans and computers on the road."", ""Tim Beyers: When you have to deal with multiple variables like that, you're dealing with a computing problem that may in fact be ideal for quantum computing."", ""Mary Long: At our Denver meet-up, we collected stock pitch ideas from members, some of which were planning to play on future shows.

In retrospect, the global economy has shown remarkable resilience in 2023. Despite the global tensions and increasing climate risks, the overall economic outlook seems positive. The disruption in energy and food markets has had a massive impact on the European economy. Whereas, tightening of global monetary conditions has caused a slowdown in economic progress worldwide. These unprecedented events in global economic development reflect a limping economy, not sprinting. According to the IMF’s October 2023 World Economic Outlook report, global growth is expected to slow down from 3.5% in 2022 to 3% in 2023 and continue a downward trajectory in 2024 to 2.9%. This economic outlook remains well below the historical average from 2000 to 2019 of 3.8%.', 'Rising headline inflation has been one of the major problems in the past few years. Headline inflation is expected to reach 5.9% in 2023 compared to 9.2% in 2022 and continue to drop to 4.8% in 2024. Core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, is projected to drop to 4.5% in 2024. As a result, most analysts are projecting a “soft landing” during the second half of 2024. The unemployment forecast for the US is very modest and is expected to record a gradual increase from 3.6% in 2023 to 3.9% by 2025.

The growth in Europe is expected to grow to 2.4% in 2023, before declining to 2.2% in 2024.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average, also known as Dow Jones or Dow, is one of the oldest and most followed equity indexes of the United States stock market. It was founded more than a century ago in 1896 by Charles Dow, the editor of the Wall Street Journal at the time. Originally, the Dow comprised just twelve companies that were commodity-focused. In 1928, the index was expanded to 30 stocks. It is a price-weighted index, unlike other market indexes which weigh businesses on their market capitalizations of businesses.\xa0', 'In a stock market filled with uncertainty, investments in the Dow are great for stability and defense. However, in a bull market, the Dow cannot always compete with the growth of other indexes that are more tech heavy. For example, so far this year, the market has responded positively to steady interest rates and slowing inflation. The benchmark S&P 500 has returned more than 24% to investors year-to-date. The NASDAQ Composite has outplaced even the S&P 500, returning over 44% to investors. The Dow has returned around 13%.\xa0', 'However, these numbers do not tell the whole story. The Dow has actually shined for value investors over the long term, unlike the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. For example, despite stellar returns in 2023, the S&P 500 is still slightly off the peak it achieved in early 2022. The NASDAQ is actually down by 5%. The Dow sits handsomely above both these indexes with returns of around 3% during this time span. Stocks on the Dow often lag behind the overall market during bull periods but are resilient against sell-offs during recessions.\xa0', 'Some of the top Dow stocks to buy now include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). These firms have established product lines and steady revenues, a quality that all Dow stocks are famous for. Andrew Witty, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), recently highlighted during the third quarter earnings call that the firm was focused on delivering well-balanced and durable growth for investors.\xa0', ""“As a direct result of mission-driven focus, this year, we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022. By the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at Optum Health, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on Optum Rx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third-quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year."", 'The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models. This year, we expect Optum Health will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources and until now, often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need.”', 'Our Methodology', 'These were picked from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and ranked by hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

If you want to read about some more stocks to buy as interest rates remain high, go directly to 5 Biggest Stocks That Benefit From High Interest Rates.\xa0', 'The central bank in the United States has indicated that it will begin a massive change in monetary policy heading into the next year as inflation numbers cool and confidence grows about a soft landing for the economy. In the final meeting of the year, the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged for the third straight month, with officials even signaling that rate cuts might be on the horizon in 2024. Fed chief Jerome Powell pointed to strong growth numbers, a comeback in the labor market, and progress on inflation as some of the reasons for optimism.\xa0', 'News platform Fox Business reports that Federal Open Market Committee officials expect rates to fall to 4.6% by the end of 2024. This forecast envisions at least three rate cuts next year, each a quarter point. This policy will continue into 2025 and 2026. Even though some experts predict that the Fed may start cutting rates as early as March next year, others have more moderate expectations. For example, Kathy Bostjancic, the chief economist at financial services firm Nationwide, expects rate cuts to begin by May.\xa0', 'Higher interest rates are good for companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), who benefit from higher earnings on consumer and business loans, effectively increasing their revenues overnight. In a higher interest rates environment, rates rise across the board, from mortgages, to credit card debt, to auto loans. Over the past year-and-a-half, interest rates have climbed at a pace not seen in nearly fifty years.\xa0', 'However, investors should keep in mind that this is a gradual process. Even though inflation numbers are cooling, the prices of consumer items remain 3% above what they were last year. The prices of basic necessities like food, healthcare, and rent have all gone up in the past year and show no signs of slowing down. It will likely be a few months before the rate cuts promised by the Federal Reserve are announced. It will then take at least two years or more for the economy to fully stabilize following these cuts.\xa0\xa0', 'In this overall situation, even as rate cuts begin, investments in companies that benefit from rising interest rates are expected to return handsome profits. This is because these companies have diverse revenue streams and long-term plans in place for growth that shield them from macroeconomic volatility. One example of this is Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), whose CEO Jane Fraser, said during the third quarter earnings call that the firm was a bank for all seasons because of ample liquidity and a diversified earnings base for clients.\xa0', '“In terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past 5 years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection. Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% and which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100 bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buyback quarter by quarter, and I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board.”', 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that benefit when interest rates are high and have received positive analyst coverage were selected for the list.

If you want to read about some more stocks to buy as interest rates remain high, go directly to 5 Biggest Stocks That Benefit From High Interest Rates.\xa0', 'The central bank in the United States has indicated that it will begin a massive change in monetary policy heading into the next year as inflation numbers cool and confidence grows about a soft landing for the economy. In the final meeting of the year, the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged for the third straight month, with officials even signaling that rate cuts might be on the horizon in 2024. Fed chief Jerome Powell pointed to strong growth numbers, a comeback in the labor market, and progress on inflation as some of the reasons for optimism.\xa0', 'News platform Fox Business reports that Federal Open Market Committee officials expect rates to fall to 4.6% by the end of 2024. This forecast envisions at least three rate cuts next year, each a quarter point. This policy will continue into 2025 and 2026. Even though some experts predict that the Fed may start cutting rates as early as March next year, others have more moderate expectations. For example, Kathy Bostjancic, the chief economist at financial services firm Nationwide, expects rate cuts to begin by May.\xa0', 'Higher interest rates are good for companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), who benefit from higher earnings on consumer and business loans, effectively increasing their revenues overnight. In a higher interest rates environment, rates rise across the board, from mortgages, to credit card debt, to auto loans. Over the past year-and-a-half, interest rates have climbed at a pace not seen in nearly fifty years.\xa0', 'However, investors should keep in mind that this is a gradual process. Even though inflation numbers are cooling, the prices of consumer items remain 3% above what they were last year. The prices of basic necessities like food, healthcare, and rent have all gone up in the past year and show no signs of slowing down. It will likely be a few months before the rate cuts promised by the Federal Reserve are announced. It will then take at least two years or more for the economy to fully stabilize following these cuts.\xa0\xa0', 'In this overall situation, even as rate cuts begin, investments in companies that benefit from rising interest rates are expected to return handsome profits. This is because these companies have diverse revenue streams and long-term plans in place for growth that shield them from macroeconomic volatility. One example of this is Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), whose CEO Jane Fraser, said during the third quarter earnings call that the firm was a bank for all seasons because of ample liquidity and a diversified earnings base for clients.\xa0', '“In terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past 5 years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection. Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% and which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100 bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buyback quarter by quarter, and I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board.”', 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that benefit when interest rates are high and have received positive analyst coverage were selected for the list.

Then, in the spring of the next year, he ordered the release of another 130 million barrels.', 'Prices at the pump fell between $0.17 and $0.42 per gallon. With the massive withdrawals and previously scheduled mandatory sales, the SPR shed\xa0270 million barrels\xa0and fell to the lowest in 40 years.', 'Now that prices have stabilized, it should be the right time to start refilling the reserve that is not called strategic for nothing. While the U.S. no longer needs a massive cushion against a potential repeat of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, it does need a guaranteed crude oil supply for a set period of time that, per the IEA, is best set at around 90 days of consumption. After the withdrawals, the SPR fell to 20 days of consumption.', 'Indeed, the Department of Energy has made it a habit to announce a solicitation for a few million barrels of oil every now and then when West Texas Intermediate falls below $75 per barrel. Some of these solicitations have even led to purchases, usually at the rate of 3 million barrels.', 'While modest, the rate of announced purchases is understandable: every time the DoE announces it even plans to organize a solicitation for the SPR refill, prices immediately tick up. The department earlier this year set itself a price range of between $67 and $72 per barrel and has tried to stick to it, arguing the federal government will make a profit on the massive withdrawals of 2022 as that oil was sold at higher prices.', 'So far this year, the DoE has bought less than 20 million barrels of oil to refill the strategic petroleum reserve. An unnamed source close to the department\xa0told\xa0Reuters in June that plans were to buy back some 12 million barrels by the end of the year. Then, in October, the Department of Energy said it planned to buy 6 million barrels by January 2024, suggesting it was behind on its 12-million-barrel target.', 'The department has also been returning oil to the SPR after essentially lending some to oil companies. In early December, it said it had struck an agreement with those companies to return 4 million barrels by February. Over the first eleven months of 2023,\xa09 million barrels\xa0were bought back or returned to the SPR, Reuters reported in early December.', 'Then, in mid-December, the Department of Energy said it had struck another\xa02-million-barrel purchase\xa0deal in mid-December, and another, for\xa03 million barrels, announced just this week. This has brought the total repurchased SPR oil to 14 million barrels and 2 million barrels above the 2023 target.', 'Yet, it is nowhere near to constituting an actual refill of the strategic reserve. For that, the federal government has not only to keep buying oil at a relatively steady pace but also to stop selling oil from the SPR—an activity mandated by Congress. The DoE managed to get the sale of 140 million barrels over 2023 to 2027 cancelled, but it will probably need more cancellations to return the SPR anywhere near its previous levels.', 'Some have argued that the SPR is no longer really necessary. The United States is the largest producer of crude oil, the argument goes, and it is no longer vitally dependent on Middle Eastern oil imports.', 'Yet the Energy Information Administration’s weekly petroleum status\xa0updates\xa0show that the U.S. has remained a steady importer at a rate of about 6-6.7 million barrels daily. Not all of these barrels come from the Middle East, of course. In fact, less than half a million barrels daily come from that region—Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and neither has any intention of turning the taps off. Even so, disruptions happen. Prices change.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term."", ""Shares of this investment bank have returned +18% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.3% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 17.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.3%.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.51 points to a change of -13.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.2%.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.53 indicates a change of +18.5% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $12.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.6%. The $54 billion and $56.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.6% and +4.6%, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Morgan Stanley reported revenues of $13.27 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.2%.

The EPS surprise was +8.66%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Morgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

(NYSE:OMC) A High Quality Stock To Own?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omnicom-group-inc-nyse-omc-121929748.html,1703938769,STORY,['OMC'],"[""While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC)."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Omnicom Group is:', '35% = US$1.5b ÷ US$4.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Omnicom Group has a higher ROE than the average (9.8%) in the Media industry."", ""That is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk ."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""Omnicom Group does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.34. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.', 'But note: Omnicom Group may not be the best stock to buy.

Then, in the spring of the next year, he ordered the release of another 130 million barrels.', 'Prices at the pump fell between $0.17 and $0.42 per gallon. With the massive withdrawals and previously scheduled mandatory sales, the SPR shed\xa0270 million barrels\xa0and fell to the lowest in 40 years.', 'Now that prices have stabilized, it should be the right time to start refilling the reserve that is not called strategic for nothing. While the U.S. no longer needs a massive cushion against a potential repeat of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, it does need a guaranteed crude oil supply for a set period of time that, per the IEA, is best set at around 90 days of consumption. After the withdrawals, the SPR fell to 20 days of consumption.', 'Indeed, the Department of Energy has made it a habit to announce a solicitation for a few million barrels of oil every now and then when West Texas Intermediate falls below $75 per barrel. Some of these solicitations have even led to purchases, usually at the rate of 3 million barrels.', 'While modest, the rate of announced purchases is understandable: every time the DoE announces it even plans to organize a solicitation for the SPR refill, prices immediately tick up. The department earlier this year set itself a price range of between $67 and $72 per barrel and has tried to stick to it, arguing the federal government will make a profit on the massive withdrawals of 2022 as that oil was sold at higher prices.', 'So far this year, the DoE has bought less than 20 million barrels of oil to refill the strategic petroleum reserve. An unnamed source close to the department\xa0told\xa0Reuters in June that plans were to buy back some 12 million barrels by the end of the year. Then, in October, the Department of Energy said it planned to buy 6 million barrels by January 2024, suggesting it was behind on its 12-million-barrel target.', 'The department has also been returning oil to the SPR after essentially lending some to oil companies. In early December, it said it had struck an agreement with those companies to return 4 million barrels by February. Over the first eleven months of 2023,\xa09 million barrels\xa0were bought back or returned to the SPR, Reuters reported in early December.', 'Then, in mid-December, the Department of Energy said it had struck another\xa02-million-barrel purchase\xa0deal in mid-December, and another, for\xa03 million barrels, announced just this week. This has brought the total repurchased SPR oil to 14 million barrels and 2 million barrels above the 2023 target.', 'Yet, it is nowhere near to constituting an actual refill of the strategic reserve. For that, the federal government has not only to keep buying oil at a relatively steady pace but also to stop selling oil from the SPR—an activity mandated by Congress. The DoE managed to get the sale of 140 million barrels over 2023 to 2027 cancelled, but it will probably need more cancellations to return the SPR anywhere near its previous levels.', 'Some have argued that the SPR is no longer really necessary. The United States is the largest producer of crude oil, the argument goes, and it is no longer vitally dependent on Middle Eastern oil imports.', 'Yet the Energy Information Administration’s weekly petroleum status\xa0updates\xa0show that the U.S. has remained a steady importer at a rate of about 6-6.7 million barrels daily. Not all of these barrels come from the Middle East, of course. In fact, less than half a million barrels daily come from that region—Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and neither has any intention of turning the taps off. Even so, disruptions happen. Prices change. It’s a good idea to have a bit of a supply buffer in case of such a disruption.', 'By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Global Shippers Bypass Suez Canal As Security Concerns Persist', ""Sinopec: China's Oil Consumption Will Peak by 2030"", 'GasBuddy: Gasoline and Diesel Prices To Fall In 2024', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

One of the prominent investment themes of 2023 was artificial intelligence (AI), with much of the hype captured by the Magnificent Seven\xa0stocks.', ""While these shares performed well during 2023, it would behoove investors to think beyond this cohort as it relates to investing in AI. Cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) business Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) has posted a respectable operating performance so far this year. In fact, after a 100% return, Salesforce is the top-performing Dow Jones Industrial Average stock of 2023 at the time of this writing -- and I think it's headed even higher."", ""Let's dig into what helped propel such a massive move in Salesforce stock this year, and why 2024 could be the start of a new growth story for the enterprise software leader."", 'For many years Salesforce was known for its aggressive growth tactics, mostly in the form of splashy acquisitions. While Wall Street and investors historically cheered these deals, Salesforce arguably bit off more than it could chew following its $28 billion purchase of messaging and productivity tool Slack back in 2021. While the integration efforts have been a bit sluggish, causing many to believe Salesforce overpaid, the deal actually carried a silver lining.', ""In retrospect, the Slack acquisition more or less forced Salesforce's management to take a step back and reevaluate the entire business. This means that firing on all cylinders in the name of revenue growth was no longer the top priority. Instead, Salesforce realized that it needed to mature and start focusing on both revenue and profitability."", 'While this may sound obvious, keep in mind that the last couple of years have been difficult for cloud software businesses as customers have been operating under much tighter budgets due to a challenging macroeconomy. In a way, the Slack acquisition could not have come at a worse -- or better -- time, depending on how you look at things.', 'After reporting earnings for the third quarter of its fiscal 2024, ended Oct. 31, Salesforce demonstrated that it is serious about long-term sustained profits. Moreover, the role that Salesforce will play in AI looks discounted, if not misunderstood, as Wall Street continues to be enamored by the Magnificent Seven.', ""The table below illustrates Salesforce's revenue growth across its various products over the last year:"", 'Category', 'Q3 FY 2023', 'Q4 FY 2023', 'Q1 FY 2024', 'Q2 FY 2024', 'Q3 FY 2024', 'Sales', '17%', '16%', '13%', '12%', '10%', 'Service', '16%', '15%', '13%', '12%', '11%', 'Platform and other', '22%', '18%', '12%', '11%', '11%', 'Marketing and commerce', '18%', '16%', '10%', '10%', '8%', 'Data', '16%', '20%', '20%', '16%', '22%', 'Total subscription and supportrevenue', '18%', '17%', '13%', '12%', '12%', 'Data source: Salesforce Investor Relations.', ""You can see that the company's revenue is decelerating.

Since early 2022, the company's margin profile has steadily improved and flowed straight to the bottom line."", ""For the third quarter, Salesforce generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 1,088% year over year. Moreover, on a year-to-date basis, the company's total free cash flow of $6.2 billion represented 67% annual growth."", ""It's obvious that Salesforce has turned into a leaner operation in the face of decelerating revenue. Nonetheless, with strong margins and robust cash flow, Salesforce looks ready to get back to making some noteworthy investments -- this time in AI."", 'During the third-quarter earnings call, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff stated that ""the AI revolution is a productivity revolution."" This is an important, yet subtle, remark. Remember, at heart Salesforce is a CRM for sales and marketing professionals. But over the years, the company\'s major acquisitions have included analytics tool Tableau, data integrator MuleSoft, and messaging tool Slack. All of these fit squarely into workforce productivity services.', 'What Benioff is alluding to above is that Salesforce can actually offer customers an end-to-end spectrum of productivity and automation tools wrapped around AI. In fact, Benioff also said that Salesforce Data Cloud was ""the foundation of every AI transaction"" during the third quarter. As seen in the table above, while the company\'s overall revenue growth is slowing, the Data category is the only one that increased year over year.', ""Given the company's myriad subscription platforms, I think it's only a matter of time before the secular demand fueling AI helps the company's other revenue streams return to more robust growth."", ""The chart above shows the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of Salesforce, benchmarked against a peer set of other enterprise software businesses. The key takeaway is that Salesforce's forward P/E of 32 is the lowest among these comparable companies. While some investors could argue that Salesforce is a more mature business compared to the likes of Atlassian, Datadog, and ServiceNow, the disparity among valuation multiples is tough to ignore."", ""Given management's commentary on the earnings call, coupled with Salesforce's increasing cash flow, I can't help but think that the next phase of growth is right around the corner. I view Salesforce as an under-the-radar AI opportunity and shares look like a bargain at current trading levels.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Motorola Solutions' (NYSE:MSI) look very promising so lets take a look."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Motorola Solutions is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.34 = US$2.4b ÷ (US$12b - US$5.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Motorola Solutions has an ROCE of 34%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Communications industry average of 8.3%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions ', ""In the above chart we have measured Motorola Solutions' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Motorola Solutions here  for free."", ""Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Motorola Solutions. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 34%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 22%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Motorola Solutions thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital."", ""On a separate but related note, it's important to know that Motorola Solutions has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 43%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks."", ""A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Motorola Solutions has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 191% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue."", ""On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Motorola Solutions   you'll probably want to know about."", ""If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here."", 'Have feedback on this article?

That scale not only creates a powerful network effect, but it also affords the company a significant cost advantage.', 'Specifically, Visa can spread expenses across more transactions than its peers, so the company consistently earns higher margins. That strong profitability allows Visa to reinvest more aggressively in growth, which effectively reinforces its leadership. Some of that reinvested capital is funneled into consumer payments innovations, but the company is also pursuing opportunities in what management calls ""new flows"" (e.g., account-based commercial payments and employee payouts) and value-added services (e.g., risk management solutions).', 'Visa reported wrapped its fiscal 2023 in September with solid financial results.

Since tumbling into a bear market in 2022, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed to new all-time highs, while the growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has bounced in the neighborhood of 50% off of its lows.', 'Interestingly, though, the index most responsible for lifting the broader market to new heights in 2021 is still languishing below its record high. As of the closing bell on Dec. 27, the Nasdaq Composite remained 6% shy of its high-water mark.', ""While this decline might be disappointing to short-term traders, it's music to the ears of long-term-minded investors. That's because notable dips in the Nasdaq Composite of any form have historically represented an opportunity to buy high-quality growth stocks at a discount."", ""What follows are four unsurpassed growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip."", ""The first unrivaled growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not adding with the Nasdaq Composite still recovering from the 2022 bear market is none other than e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Although there's some concern that Amazon could struggle if the U.S. economy weakens in 2024, the segments that matter most for this juggernaut are still firing on all cylinders."", ""Most consumers are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2022, Insider Intelligence (formerly known as eMarketer) estimated that Amazon brought in nearly 40% of all online retail sales in the United States. However, online retail sales yield razor-thin margins. While its online marketplace is a big-time revenue producer, Amazon's operating cash flow and income are predominantly derived from its ancillary segments."", ""None of these divisions is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS). According to estimates from tech-analysis company Canalys, AWS accounted for 31% of global cloud infrastructure service share in the September-ended quarter. Enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure is still very early in its ramp, which suggests sustained double-digit growth is likely throughout the decade (if not beyond). AWS is consistently responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income despite the fact that it only accounts for about a sixth of the company's net sales."", ""Amazon's subscription services and advertising services segments are important cash flow drivers, too. Amazon has signed up more than 200 million people globally to a Prime subscription. Further, its online marketplace is attracting more than 2 billion people to its site each month. That's a recipe for strong ad-pricing power with merchants."", ""Though Amazon isn't inexpensive from a traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio standpoint, it's historically cheap relative to its future cash flow. Since the company reinvests most of its cash flow back into its business, this price-to-cash-flow metric is far more telling of how cheap Amazon stock is right now."", ""A second unsurpassed growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market decline is small-cap furniture stock Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE). While recessionary fears have the potential to weigh down the traditionally stodgy furniture industry, Lovesac's out-of-the-box innovations show it's not like its brick-and-mortar peers."", 'The differentiation between Lovesac and every other furniture company is readily apparent in its products. ""Sactionals"" -- modular couches that can be rearranged to fit most living spaces -- account for just shy of 90% of Lovesac\'s net sales. Sactionals have more than 200 different cover choices, and the yarn used in their production is derived entirely from recycled plastic water bottles. It\'s worth noting that sactionals have an abundance of upgrade options available, too, including built-in surround sound and wireless charging stations.', ""As you may have guessed, this differentiation does make sactionals costlier than a traditional sofa or sectional couch. But this priciness is actually a competitive advantage for the company. It's specifically targeting middle- and upper-income consumers who are less likely to alter their buying habits during economic downturns."", ""Lovesac's omnichannel sales platform is another key to its success. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lovesac was able to pivot its sales online easily. While it does have a physical presence in 40 U.S. states, it hedges its brick-and-mortar sales with popup showrooms, brand-name partnerships, and direct-to-consumer sales. This strategy lowers its overhead expenses and lifts its operating margin."", 'Considering its low double-digit annual sales growth, Lovesac looks like quite the bargain at 12 times forward-year earnings.', ""The third top-notch growth stock you'll regret not scooping up in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market drop is media company Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). Though the COVID-19 pandemic clobbered multiple facets of Disney's operations, such as its theme parks and film division, numerous catalysts are now set to act as tailwinds."", ""To build on the obvious, Walt Disney should see a steady rebound in its film entertainment division and theme park operations as life returns to normal and attendance picks up. These bread-and-butter segments, which are fueled by Disney's exceptionally valuable brand and strong pricing power, can sustain double-digit earnings growth over the next five years."", ""Even more important, Walt Disney's storytelling and engagement simply can't be duplicated by other companies. Though there are other theme parks to attend and movies to watch, they don't have the characters, depth of story, or emotional attachment factor that Walt Disney's theme parks and movies have brought to the table for decades. Consumers will willingly pay a premium for the Disney experience."", ""Another catalyst for Walt Disney is the expected improvement in the company's streaming operations. Increasing monthly subscription prices on its various service tiers will bring in additional revenue that, along with mindful cost-cutting, should shift this segment to profitability toward the end of fiscal 2024."", ""A forward P/E ratio of 17 for an industry leader that's expected to deliver annualized earnings growth of 15.4% over the next five years is a screaming bargain."", ""The fourth unsurpassed growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is ultra-popular coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX). Although inflation and COVID-19 were both big-time nemeses for Starbucks in 2022, there is now a laundry list of catalysts acting as a tailwind."", 'Similar to Walt Disney, Starbucks is enjoying favorable year-over-year operating performance comparisons as it moves beyond the worst of the pandemic. This is especially true in China, where Starbucks operates more than 6,800 stores as of Oct. 1, 2023. China abandoned its stringent ""zero-COVID"" mitigation strategy in December 2022, which means we\'re still witnessing a healthy ramp in sales as life returns to normal.', ""Something very clearly working in Starbucks' favor is the loyalty of its customer base. Speaking as someone who's only missed his daily trip to Starbucks on a handful of occasions over the past 30 years, the company's customers tend to be willing to absorb price hikes above and beyond the rate of inflation. Starbucks closed out fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 1) with 32.6 million active Rewards Members. These Rewards Members average bigger tickets than non-Rewards customers, and they're more likely to use mobile ordering, which expedites servicing times."", 'Furthermore, Starbucks made big changes to its drive-thru ordering system during the pandemic that are now paying dividends. It added video to its ordering boards to personalize the drive-thru experience, as well as focused on food and drink pairings to drive high-margin items and expedite the ordering process.', ""While Starbucks' stock might not appear cheap at 20 times forward-year earnings, it certainly is once you factor in its phenomenal pricing power, loyal customer base, and expected annualized earnings growth of 15.5% over the next five years."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Brad Smith break down the 2024 plans for Starbucks (SBUX), Disney (DIS), and Gap (GPS)."", 'Starbucks has laid out a 3-year plan to unlock $3 billion in efficiencies while also trying to repair partner culture amid unionization efforts.', 'Disney has announced workforce reductions to control costs under returning CEO Bob Iger, who faces activist pressure to invest more in high-potential areas like parks.', 'Gap starts the year with new CEO Richard Dickson at the helm following store closures and sales declines. With a marketing background, Dickson may unveil a restructuring within 6-12 months to catalyze a turnaround.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '[AUDIO LOGO]', 'BRIAN SOZZI: 2023 was the year of change, with companies touting plans to evolve their business for the future.', ""Starbucks announced its triple shot reinvention back in November, as it strives for long-term growth. I guess that's a well named hat tip to the Starbucks marketing department for cooking that one up. But if you go back to this release on what this reinvention plan is, two things stick out to me or really stand out to me that Starbucks has to start delivering on next year, if this stock is going to come off the lows. Really dreadful year for Starbucks investors."", ""One, unlock efficiency. As part of this plan, Starbucks trying to generate $3 billion in savings over 3 years, $2 billion of that outside the store. So things it's doing outside of its own stores that are probably wasteful, make no sense, and should be cut."", 'And then number two, reinvigorate, Brad, the partner culture. And this is really speaking to I think the ongoing union issues that continue to plague Starbucks. I think some folks could easily make the argument they continue to get worse. Bottom line for me is that they are not going anywhere.', ""And like we said yesterday and even earlier in the week, Starbucks has to address this. Get it done and dusted once and for all whatever that might mean, but probably come at the expense of the company's bottom line."", ""BRAD SMITH: So here's some of the benchmarks that you can read Starbucks up against, especially for this reinvention plan-- the triple shot reinvention plan, as you mentioned a moment ago. As the company has set out some of these goals. Growing comps by 5% to 7%, with revenue growth at the low end of the 10% to 12% range. Earnings growth of 15% to 20%. You can grade them on that based on some of the prevailing trends that they set guidance for fiscal 2024."", ""Bottom line here though, you got to think about the international relevance of this brand as well. They're talking within this plan about what's the growth needs to look like both here domestically but as well as internationally and in the core market of China."", ""And so one of the huge things that is important to remember is especially across some of the plays that can be looked at like a Starbucks, where you still need to have a strong corporate and also relationship with the franchisees, the partners as they call them, where those partners might be tough to find, especially in a tough purchasing or tough financing environment like we're in right now. And perhaps that's only going to get more difficult for the company going into next year."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Just give me a cheaper iced coffee, Starbucks.', ""BRAD SMITH: I just want the unicorn frappe to come back. Also, let's talk about a magical place, Disney. Less magical this year. They launched a reinvention plan of its own with Bob Iger back at the helm, starting with job cuts. Those job cuts coming early in the year."", 'This was a way that Bob Iger was trying to signal to the activist campaigns that were coming out of nowhere like Dikembe Mutombo blocking a shot that was unexpected for any basketball players out there. You know the reference. The finger-wagging, the activist campaigns were essentially throwing at Disney as well as the statistics.', ""At the end of the day, that was his own type of efforts to try and say, hey, I've got a handle on costs. I have a handle on getting back to profit. And, oh, yeah, by the way, we might be thinking about a life without ESPN here at Disney. That's still some of the larger questions that lingered."", ""And even after that later on in the year you saw this company hit, what, eight year lows. So a lot of these questions still linger, as well as just I think longer leadership question at the company of who's after Iger at the end of the day because that's still unclear at this point."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: And what do you do with these legacy assets. Now, we're still watching Paramount reportedly shopping itself, whether they go to Warner Brothers Discovery. That is to be determined."", ""But it's one thing for investors to speculate and analysts to speculate, sure, sell off your legacy TV assets like ABC, Disney. But who is buying it? You have to have a willing buyer, and it has to come at a good price. You just don't say, hey, we're going to just unload these assets and they're just going to float out there in the ether sphere."", ""And I just think, Brad, it's going to be hard for Iger to do this because it would be him acknowledging that he didn't see this coming 10 years ago. And he would really I think hurt his legacy if he were to spin off these assets."", ""BRAD SMITH: And at the end of the day too, you've got to think about what they're going to do to continue to invest in some of the businesses that they've signaled that they're going to develop even more on top of, I think most notably at the parks and resorts business. More expansion internationally. More development upon the thousands of acres of land that they've got in Florida that are undeveloped at this point too. So that's more money that's potentially going out the door."", ""But to buy into or to spend into an experience where they're already going to be charging the customer more. And that's another element where the customer is going to have to grapple with how much are we comfortable to pay for those magical passes that allow us to skip the line when we go to Disney World."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: So true. All right. And lastly, and Gap. The company has struggled to connect with consumers, but its new CEO is looking to change that. And, Brad, look, I've been very critical of Gap for going on over 10 years, sales have just been dreadful. Margins dreadful. They've closed hundreds of stores."", ""And it's not just the Gap division. It's been the Old Navy division. The Banana Republic division sometimes call falls into favor with investors. But now the new CEO Richard Dickson, really the guy who saved Mattel now at the helm over at Gap."", ""And I've had the time, I've had a moment to just connect with Richard on just to get a sense of what he might be focusing on for 2024. I do think you will see an investor day from Gap at some point middle of next year, where they try to reset the investor narrative for the company."", ""But as I've learned covering CEOs for a long time, any new CEO is likely within their first 6 to 12 months come out with some form of restructuring plan. I think that is going to be a key initial playbook by Richard, whether it is closing more stores, fine tuning its manufacturing capacity. I do think that plan will hit in the first half of next year."", 'And then secondarily, what Richard does very well is marketing. He is a marketing whiz, but he also, I think he understands the apparel industry, having spent a long time over at Jones Apparel Group. I think he will bring more stylish things that human beings want to actually buy from a Gap and Republic inside of their stores next year. But again, a big turnaround in a tall ask to drive that turnaround over at Gap.', ""BRAD SMITH: Does it mean from your perspective because you've covered this company for a long time. Does it mean that they need to grow up another in-house brand? And I think about what they're doing that started off as a relevance and kind of collaboration partnership with Dapper Dan and starting Gap underneath of Gap and having a few hoodies there. But now they're expanding that into a kid's clothing line. Does it need another kind of reinvigoration of the brand with another subsidy within there?"", 'BRIAN SOZZI: All three a curveball. I think Gap and Richard, they have to go back and consider splitting the company back up now. This is on the table a couple of years ago. Prior management ultimately decided not to do it. I just think it would be more value creating for these brands to trade on their own merit, and ultimately that would drive more focus with each brand. Gap is focused on Gap. Banana is focused on Banana. And Old Navy of course, focused on Old Navy.', ""We also want to talk about one more stock that's striving for its own reinvention plan. That's Beyond Meat. My team letting me mention this yet again. Stock really shot up over 8% about a half an hour ago on our analysis. Of course, we had a really exclusive interview with Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown."", 'Stock pulling back a little bit. But nonetheless, I think Ethan is trying to figure out what gets more people back into the plant-based meat category and something that Peter McGinnis, his counterpart, the CEO of Impossible Foods, is trying to do as well.', ""BRAD SMITH: Got to just ask yourself, has it bottomed out? I mean, this is a company in Beyond Meat that it was really a gauge for another company in Impossible Foods, which at the time was a unicorn. I don't know what their valuation is at this point. It's kind of fallen into obscurity at this juncture."", 'But for Beyond Meat, still the closest thing that anybody in the market has to look at as an alternative meat play that is out there and has its own operations now and that is trying to get more partnerships, both on the wholesale partnership side, going into more of the retail footprints.', ""And then on the restaurant side, trying to drum up even more demand for beyond what beyond bacon, egg, and cheese in the morning or beyond sausage, egg, and cheese. I don't even know if they do bacon yet. But at the end of the day, it's going to require them to get into more meats."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. More meats.', 'BRAD SMITH: More meats.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: It's going to come."", 'BRAD SMITH: More meats for you.']"

Higher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered the company’s Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) are also aiding the company. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving Parker-Hannifin’s margins. The company’s measures to add shareholder value hold promise. However, the escalating cost of sales and rising selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to its bottom line.

This indicates a decline of 17.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

We expect pricing to be up 3.2% in the second quarter. A focus on innovation, especially in the frozen and snacks categories, has been an upside. Growth in the frozen category reflects the strength of the company’s brands and the effective execution of the Conagra Way playbook.Though the frozen business was hit by changing consumer behavior in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, it continued to see unit share gains in key categories like single-serve meals.

GPN.', 'Per Mastercard Economics Institute (MEI), the year 2024 will be characterized by easing inflation and a relatively stable labor market fueling consumer spending. As inflation pressure softens across most global economies, consumers will be able to expend more, benefiting companies in the payments space. MEI expects the consumer price index, measuring inflation, to cool down to 4.9% globally in 2024 from 6% in 2023. Although this number will be higher than the pre-pandemic trend of 2.7%, consumer spending should not take a hit as signaled by improved travel-related spending post-pandemic and growth in U.S. retail sales in the 2023 holiday season amid inflationary pressures.', 'Companies in the payments space often resort to mergers and acquisitions strategy, reaping the benefits of diversification.

Mastercard believes if the swipe fees are reduced, it will have a negative impact on small businesses and consumers. Companies in the payments space utilize the funds generated from swipe fees to enhance security measures and provide reward programs. Curtailing on such a source of revenue might impact the security of transactions, thereby impacting these companies’ core value proposition.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been less than pleasing. After all, the share price is down 41% in the last three years, significantly under-performing the market."", ""It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Leggett & Platt ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""During the three years that the share price fell, Leggett & Platt's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 2.2% each year. The share price decline of 16% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy."", 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', ""This free interactive report on Leggett & Platt's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", 'When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Leggett & Platt, it has a TSR of -31% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""Investors in Leggett & Platt had a tough year, with a total loss of 13% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 27%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.4% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Leggett & Platt  that you should be aware of."", 'For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

VTR is well-poised to benefit from its diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets in the key markets of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. An aging population and the rise in healthcare expenditure by senior citizens are likely to benefit the senior housing operating portfolio (SHOP).The outpatient medical and research segment is expected to gain from favorable outpatient visit trends. Ventas’ accretive investments to expand its research portfolio are encouraging. A healthy balance sheet acts as a tailwind. However, competition from other industry players and dependence on a few tenants raise concerns. High interest rates add to its woes.', ""The senior citizen population is expected to rise in the years ahead. As a result, the national healthcare expenditure by senior citizens, who constitute a major customer base of healthcare services and incur higher healthcare expenditures than the average population, is likely to increase in the upcoming period.Per the company’s third-quarter 2023 Earnings Presentation, it is projected that the average annual growth of people aged 80 years and above will more than double over the next four years and nearly double again in the following four-year period.\xa0 Hence, with an expectation of a rising senior citizen population in the years ahead and a muted new supply in its markets, VTR is well-prepared for a compelling multiyear growth opportunity. Our estimate indicates a year-over-year rise of 9.5% in the SHOP segment's NOI in 2023.Moreover, the healthcare sector is relatively immune to the macroeconomic uncertainty compared with office, retail and apartment companies, as consumers still need to spend on healthcare services while curtailing discretionary purchases. This aspect of the industry provides stability to the company during tough economic conditions and shields it from market volatility.Amid favorable demographics and growing outpatient trends, Ventas is committed to capitalizing on this upside within its outpatient medical and research portfolio, which includes outpatient medical buildings and research centers. The growth in the people aged 65 years and above is driving the increase in outpatient visits as they make three times more visits to the doctor than the general population. It is projected that this age group will represent 20% of the U.S. population by 2030. Therefore, the portfolio is well-positioned to capitalize on this rising demand.The same-store NOI growth for this segment was more than 3% for eight out of nine quarters. We estimate a year-over-year increase of 5% and 5.3% in the company’s outpatient medical and research segment’s NOI in 2023 and 2024, respectively.The company is carrying out accretive investments to enhance its research portfolio, which is essential for the delivery of crucial healthcare services and research related to life-saving vaccines and therapeutics. Ventas owns research centers in notable life science clusters of Cambridge, San Francisco, Maryland, Raleigh and Philadelphia, with a presence in some of the top-tier research university campuses.Moreover, per the third-quarter 2023 Earnings Presentation, 73% of the company’s annual rent comes from high-quality tenants from top-tier universities and companies. With top-rated tenants and long-lease terms, its high-quality portfolio assures steady growth in cash flows. Our estimate indicates year-over-year growth of 7.8% in the company’s outpatient medical and research segment’s total revenues in 2023.Ventas maintains a healthy balance sheet position with ample financial flexibility. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had more than $3.1 billion of liquidity and a net debt to further adjusted EBITDA of 7.0X. It has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule with a weighted average maturity of 5.3 years. The company’s decent financial flexibility is likely to support its growth endeavors."", 'Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have rallied 23.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s increase of 21.5%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Competition from national and local healthcare operators may weigh on Ventas. The company’s operators contend with peers for occupancy, which could limit the company’s power to raise rents and affect revenues and profitability.Ventas’ triple-net-leased property segment is exposed to tenant concentration risk, with properties leased to Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred accounting for a significant portion of total net operating income in the three months ended Sep 30, 2023. Hence, in case of no lease renewal, a change in lease agreements or any adverse development concerning these three tenants could lead to a deterioration in the company’s financial condition and results.Further, a high interest rate environment is a concern for Ventas. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden, and its total debt as of Sep 30, 2023 was approximately $13.4 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2023, management expects interest expense to increase due to higher rates. For 2023, it expects higher interest rates to impact its normalized FFO by 16 cents per share.Our estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 13.9% in interest expenses in the current year. Moreover, with high interest rates still in place, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Lamar Advertising Company LAMR and STAG Industrial, Inc.

If you want to read about some more stocks to buy as interest rates remain high, go directly to 5 Biggest Stocks That Benefit From High Interest Rates.\xa0', 'The central bank in the United States has indicated that it will begin a massive change in monetary policy heading into the next year as inflation numbers cool and confidence grows about a soft landing for the economy. In the final meeting of the year, the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged for the third straight month, with officials even signaling that rate cuts might be on the horizon in 2024. Fed chief Jerome Powell pointed to strong growth numbers, a comeback in the labor market, and progress on inflation as some of the reasons for optimism.\xa0', 'News platform Fox Business reports that Federal Open Market Committee officials expect rates to fall to 4.6% by the end of 2024. This forecast envisions at least three rate cuts next year, each a quarter point. This policy will continue into 2025 and 2026. Even though some experts predict that the Fed may start cutting rates as early as March next year, others have more moderate expectations. For example, Kathy Bostjancic, the chief economist at financial services firm Nationwide, expects rate cuts to begin by May.\xa0', 'Higher interest rates are good for companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), who benefit from higher earnings on consumer and business loans, effectively increasing their revenues overnight. In a higher interest rates environment, rates rise across the board, from mortgages, to credit card debt, to auto loans. Over the past year-and-a-half, interest rates have climbed at a pace not seen in nearly fifty years.\xa0', 'However, investors should keep in mind that this is a gradual process. Even though inflation numbers are cooling, the prices of consumer items remain 3% above what they were last year. The prices of basic necessities like food, healthcare, and rent have all gone up in the past year and show no signs of slowing down. It will likely be a few months before the rate cuts promised by the Federal Reserve are announced. It will then take at least two years or more for the economy to fully stabilize following these cuts.\xa0\xa0', 'In this overall situation, even as rate cuts begin, investments in companies that benefit from rising interest rates are expected to return handsome profits. This is because these companies have diverse revenue streams and long-term plans in place for growth that shield them from macroeconomic volatility. One example of this is Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), whose CEO Jane Fraser, said during the third quarter earnings call that the firm was a bank for all seasons because of ample liquidity and a diversified earnings base for clients.\xa0', '“In terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past 5 years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection. Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% and which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100 bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buyback quarter by quarter, and I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board.”', 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that benefit when interest rates are high and have received positive analyst coverage were selected for the list.

The insurance industry has a reputation as stodgy and boring, but it’s also remarkably stable, meeting a true need.', 'It’s also an industry that presents a paradox – insurance companies don’t make their money by collecting premiums. The costs of business administration and claims payouts typically exceed the annuals premiums. But – between collecting those premiums and paying out claims, the company has a pool of money at its disposal, called the float, which can be used for profitable investments.', 'Between necessity and float, insurance stocks can offer investors both stability and profits, and that makes them always worth a second look. A recent study from the investment bank HSBC underscores this point, noting that the global insurance industry collected nearly $4 trillion in non-life insurance premiums during 2022.', 'The bank’s analyst Vikram Gandhi sums it up: “While the US non-life insurance market is not a typical growth industry, premium prices, especially for the US commercial lines, have been growing for nearly five years. We think this bodes well for the profitability of the segment over the next couple of years…\xa0Overall, we prefer commercial lines-focused names vs personal lines-heavy insurers. Our preference for commercial lines-geared stocks is supported by their much wider discount to the market versus four years ago.”', 'Gandhi goes on to point out two insurance stocks that have recently reached 52-week high levels, but still have room to run. We’ve delved into TipRanks’ database to see what makes them stand out.', 'American International Group (AIG)', 'The first stock on our short list today is American International Group, better known by its acronym AIG. With operations in more than 80 countries, over 26,000 people on the payrolls, and a market cap of $47 billion, the company is consistently ranked among the world’s largest insurance firms. According to recent data from Forbes, AIG has $463.77 billion in total assets, making it the 4th largest insurance company in the US, and the 11th largest on the global scene. The company generated total revenues of $55 billion in 2022.', 'AIG’s customers can choose from wide selections of insurance products, including policies in the property and casualty, accident and health, financial, life, and liability segments. The company also offers financial services such as retirement solutions, connected to the general line of its business – protecting assets through risk management and providing for customers’ future security.', 'AIG registered a 7.8% year-over-year increase in revenue in 2022, but the company started 2023 on rough footing. The stock saw sharp losses in February, after reporting lower than expected profits in the wake of severe winter weather and increased claims activity, and again in March, during the crisis in the regional banking sector. The stock bottomed out at the end of March and has had a solid run since then, posting a 43% gain.', 'The company has credited its recent gains to strong performance in both its underwriting and Commercial Lines businesses, particularly during 3Q23. The company reported a quarterly net income of $1.61 per diluted share, up 92% year-over-year and 13 cents per share better than had been expected. The gain in income was driven by $611 million in underwriting income, which was up an impressive 264% from the prior-year quarter.', 'Covering this stock for HSBC, analyst Gandhi notes that the company is emerging from the restructuring initiative that has engaged its attention over the past several years – and that its new self, leaner and more focused, shows plenty of potential going forward. Describing AIG’s situation, Gandhi writes, “With large part of restructuring complete, AIG’s liability risk profile stands much better now relative its own history as well as peers on many aspects. Separately, following the successful execution of its transformative program AIG 200, the group is focused on further expense savings. However, we think the market has yet to be fully convinced that the ‘new’ AIG is a much more conservative risk-taker and is set to become nimbler as it rapidly advances towards separating CorebridgeFinancial (CBRG) – its L&R business. Our 2023-25 estimates are marginally ahead of the Street.”', 'The analyst goes on to initiate his coverage of these shares as a Buy, with an $86 price target that points toward a one-year gain of 27%. (To watch Gandhi’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, the Street rates AIG as a Strong Buy, based on 14 recent analyst reviews that include 11 Buys to 3 Holds. But – the $75.71 average price target suggests ~12% increase from the current share price of $67.75, significantly lower than the HSBC view. (See AIG stock forecast)', 'Chubb (CB)', 'Next up on our insurance list today is Chubb, another giant of the global insurance industry. Chubb is huge by any measure – the company has a market cap of $91.5 billion, underwrote $4.6 billion in property & casualty policies in 2022, and listed $222.74 billion in total assets at the end of 3Q23. Chubb is active in 54 countries, providing services from property and casualty insurance, personal accident and supplemental health policies, life insurance, and reinsurance policies.', 'The core of Chubb’s business is underwriting, the assessment, assumption, and management of risk, to protect customers’ assets. The company has nearly 40 years’ experience in the field, and can build on that to offer policy coverage and services, for businesses, individuals, and families, that rate among the industry’s best.', 'Chubb’s share performance through 2023 has been something of a roller coaster. Like AIG, the company’s stock fell badly in March, during that month’s banking crisis, and again like AIG, Chubb’s shares have been on an upward trend since them. But CB has taken a decidedly volatile upward path this year, with plenty of ups and downs as it regained the ground lost in March.', 'When we get down to the brass tacks, however, we find that Chubb benefits from the same factors that have always supported the insurance industry: everyone needs to manage risk and protect assets, and that means buying insurance. In the last reported quarter, 3Q23, Chubb reported a solid non-GAAP EPS of $4.95 – a result that was 53 cents per share better than had been anticipated.', 'That income rested on solid year-over-year gains in the company’s property and casualty business. Chubb reported an 8.4% increase in P&C net premiums written for Q3, and a 12.3% increase in its global P&C business. The latter included a 10.3% increase in commercial insurance and a 17.6% increase in consumer insurance. Overall, the company reported consolidated net premiums written for Q3 of $13.1 billion, a total that was up 9.1% from the prior year.', 'Turning again to analyst Vikram Gandhi, we find him upbeat on Chubb’s solid position in the industry, and describing the stock as offering a quality option for investors. Gandhi writes of the company, “Chubb operates with best-in-class metrics on several fronts: best expense ratio (25-26% vs 28-32% for peers), highest IBNR ratio for LT lines (>75% vs 65-70% for peers), and lowest financial leverage (19-20% vs 21-28% for peers). And while we see the group as potentially more exposed to social inflation risks, we note that it also offers the highest IBNR ratio on LT lines in its peer group. Overall, given its quality, we think the stock deserves to trade at a premium vs peers. Our 2023-25 estimates are marginally behind consensus.”', 'Gandhi goes on to start his coverage of this stock with a Buy rating, while setting a $263 price target to suggest an upside potential of 16% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Gandhi’s track record, click here)', 'This stock gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating, coming from 14 recent reviews that break down to 9 Buys and 5 Holds. The stock’s $226 current trading price and $245.54 average target price together imply ~9% increase in share value by the end of 2024.

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) share price is up 90% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 15% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 33% in the last year , including dividends ."", ""Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns."", ' View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', 'There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""Phillips 66 became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up."", ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", ""We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Phillips 66's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", 'It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Phillips 66 the TSR over the last 3 years was 116%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""It's good to see that Phillips 66 has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 33% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Recall that there was a long or a bit of a prolonged delay due to the FTC pushing back. That's a whole separate topic of FTC ultimately giving in. And certainly, letting that deal go through."", ""So a pickup, and a great synergy, and earnings accretion. So hitting numbers after the horizon acquisition this year. And also, they have a bunch of other drugs that sort of seem to get dwarfed by the obesity program which is a new atopic dermatitis drug and OX40 with phase III data later in '24, as well as new small cell lung cancer drug tarlatamab that's just got filed to the FDA and has a prior review, so so many things going on there. Of course, all dwarfed by obesity, though, to be clear.""]"

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool Analyst, Jason Moser. Jason, how was your weekend?"", 'Jason Moser: It was a good weekend, Deidre. How about yours?', ""Deidre Woollard: Pretty good. Every Sunday though, I start looking at the laptop, I start wondering what the news is. Last few Sundays have been pretty good for me as a news junkie and did not disappoint this weekend. The hot rumor, the rumor that is dominating the stock market today too, is that Macy's might be acquired and taken private for $5.8 billion. This is with a couple of private equity funds, including Arkhouse management and Brigade Capital Management. The deal would be for premium of 32% for shareholders based on when the deal was brought up at the end of November, stock has been battered around for a bit. That is a premium based on where we were, but from where the stock has been over time, but then today the stock has been up practically to the level of $21 a share. Is this a deal that shareholders should want?"", ""Jason Moser: If I were a shareholder, which I'm not. But if I were, I would think so. Yes. We've talked about Macy's, I think for a number of years on these shows, we've always just come back to the same ultimate conclusion. It's a business that just remains challenged because maybe it's not really necessarily a Macy's world anymore. I think Ron Gross years back, asked the question, does the world really need JCPenney? When we were talking about JCPenney's woes. I feel that question more or less applies here to at least to a degree. Macy's has more or less been treading water here over the last several years, trying to figure out the most sensible path forward. I mean, when you look at the metrics, the numbers, it really does tell you a tale of a challenge business. You go back to 2014, a helped up revenue just under $28 billion. Today that's $23 billion. The margin picture just continues to get incrementally worse. Very concerning to me, cash and short term investments. Going back 10 years, it stood at 2.3 billion dollar today, $364 million. That is a massive cash burn and the stock is down 60% over that stretch. That's what the share account being down 25% as well. They bought back shares, brought that share account down. In theory, it's supposed to have the opposite impact. But this really goes back to just what we've been talking about Macy's. It's just a business that's living in a different retail world. I'm not necessarily certain the world needs it. Maybe it does, but if I'm a shareholder of Macy's today, I'm feeling pretty good about this offer and hoping that it goes through."", ""Deidre Woollard: That is a question I'm asking myself too is, do we still need department stores? I think we'll get into that in a little bit. I wanted to talk first about why this deal, and I feel like part of it is, it's the real estate and a lot of that is that Herald Square location, the famous big Macy's. Everyone knows the big Macy's. In 2021, they announced this plan to redevelop it. They've got a whole website dedicated to it. They're going to put this giant 900 foot office building on top of and in 2021, the office buildings. But real estate is part of the play here. What do you think? We saw the Lord and Taylor building in New York become this beautiful workspace for Amazon. But what do you think the odds are of Macy's eventually becoming a skyscraper here?"", ""Jason Moser: It reminds me a bit of the Sears thesis back in the day. Sears was really kind of going through the same process in the general thesis, therefore investors was the real estate. I think that certainly something that comes into play here may be the back of the envelope valuations. You've got Macy's real estate value anywhere from $6 billion to potentially $8 billion or more. There's an asset there that certainly could be exploited. But Macy's is a retailer. They're not a real estate company per se. It's hard to imagine how all of the real estate would be used. I'm sure it ultimately would vary by location. I'm not sure office space is the most obvious option in every case, but depending on certain locations, it absolutely could be a part of it. We are seeing slowly but surely offices haven't completely gone the way the Dodo bird yet. But there are other use cases like fulfillment and distribution. I'm talking about converting some of these types of locations into more residential use cases. Whether that schools or apartments, or condos or whatever. I think ultimately that's the attraction with such a real estate portfolio is there a lot of different ways they could go with it. I think that goes back to the fact that really when we're looking at Macy's as a company, they're not the company. This really isn't the leadership team that would be able to exploit the value in that real estate portfolio as much as say, the acquirers that are certainly more real estate-focused."", ""Deidre Woollard: Absolutely. Interesting that you brought up Sears because thinking about what they tried to do we had Seritage the spin off of all of the properties, they were going to develop that they got whacked during the pandemic. They couldn't build things fast enough to really satisfy the debt there. Now they're just basically, they're just winding down in that at they're just selling everything off. The problem with having the development be part of the thesis is you just never know what those external factors are going to be."", 'Jason Moser: Exactly.', ""Deidre Woollard: I think it's interesting you mentioned the leadership, because Macy's is right about in the midst of this leadership transition. Jeff Janette, he's been there, he's been with the company for over 20 years, I think. But he's been in the CEO seat since 2017. You've got this new CEO, Tony Spring stepping, and this has been that long transition. We've known about this one for a while. They've talked a lot about the ways that they're pivoting. Getting away from being that anchor location. They're trying out smaller stores and they've been talking on the last couple of earnings calls, they're seeing great success with this. Better sales per square foot and things like that. If this gets taken over, it sounds it's going to be a whole different strategy. It's hard to know because we won't get the earnings calls, we won't be privy to it. But it seems like it would be a strategy shift."", ""Jason Moser: I think it would have to be. Macy's was born in a different time when retailers just in a very different place. Malls aren't necessarily this massive growth opportunity that they once were. Retailers across the board focusing now more on omni channel, lighter cost structures, being able to do more with less as we as consumers just have a number of different ways we can ultimately get our stuff. There's definitely something to the brand. There's some brand equity here that matters. Ultimately is this just something where Macy's continues to exist, just in a smaller form? I think that's most likely the case. But new leadership is going to have their work on their form."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, it's interesting too because you talked about JCPenney and I've been watching the different swings they've been taking. First they thought they were going to really aim at busy suburban moms. They came up with this Athleisure line. They said that's our core customer. Now they've gone more back toward their roots and being value and trying to make that work. I think with Macy's, it's interesting because they're still primarily a department store. They've got a good online experience, but there's so much competition there. You've got the rewards membership, they've got a really good rewards program, it drives around 72% of their sales at this point. They're doing some store in store stuff with Toys R Us. It seems they're trying a lot of things. But the core question is, do we still need department stores?"", ""Jason Moser: I think that that is the core question. You make a good point there in regard to their Star Boards program is somewhere in the neighborhood, 35 or so million members give or take the day. Like you said, they drive such a majority of sales. That does matter. They do have some brand loyalty there, but the department store just doesn't carry the same weight as it once did. We talk about places like Target and Walmart that are becoming those everything stores. You've got obviously Amazon, which ultimately is the everything in store. But think about Amazon, Target, and Walmart. What's one thing all three of those concepts have in common that Macy's, to my knowledge does not, grocery. You can go get virtually anything you want, including groceries at all of these different retailers now. For something like a Macy's, you're going there with intent. You may be going there just to shop around and find something. You may not even know what it is, but you're going there with some intent. We've definitely seen concepts like Target and others benefit from the store, with a store concept Dick Sporting Goods, same thing. Opening those Ultas or those Under Armour, Nike stores within in their stores. JCPenney tried it to an extent with Sephora as well. Listen man, I think the easy solution here, Macy's links up with Trader Joe's. You open up Trader Joe's within the Macy's store, and problem solved."", ""Deidre Woollard: I like that. JCPenney tried with Sephora and they've lost that deal and now Kohl's has it. The Sephora stores have been basically holding Kohl's up at this point. They're putting Sephora anywhere they can at this point."", ""Jason Moser: Cosmetics are just a phenomenal business. We've seen it with Ulta too. Ulta has really rebounded from the challenges over the past few years. Cosmetics and beauty, just a resilient, very attractive part in the bond. A very attractive market, very difficult to disrupt."", ""Deidre Woollard: I want to talk about one more sort of acquisition that wasn't, we were following this last week. Potentially a huge mega deal between Cigna and Humana would have been this massive deal in the healthcare space went from being a rumor and then over the weekend Cigna said, we're doing a buyback of $10 billion instead. They didn't reference the deal, but definitely the message was like, hey, we have a better place to put our money. The market up Cigna has been up on the news. What killed the deal? Do you think it was the fear of the fact that it never would have gone through?"", ""Jason Moser: I have to believe that they were batting that around to me. I mean, this would have been a field day for regulators. This would have absolutely been put through the ringer. I'm not saying it couldn't have happened, but maybe the line is that it was price. The companies couldn't agree on price and so just amicably part ways and I'm sure there was something to that as well. But I think that they just ultimately maybe saw the deck stacked against them, all things considered and said, now is not the time. I will say this understanding today that they say they couldn't agree on price. I think you and I and probably everybody else under the sun knows that this would have been just field they for regulators as well. I wouldn't be shocked. Not saying this will happen, but I wouldn't be shocked to at least see this deal back on the table in some form or another, depending on the outcome of next year's election. That's just something to keep in mind. 2024 is going to be probably a crazy year on the political side. Who knows how things are going to shake out. But we do know that the current administration is keeping a very close eye on big deals like this. If the White House switches over next year, that perspective could change. If it does, then maybe you see companies feeling the landscape for consolidation is a little bit more friendly and they start to entertain deals like this. It's just something to keep in mind."", ""Deidre Woollard: It may not even need to be a shift in leadership. It may just be that the tide shifts already. We've already seen some deals that we thought wouldn't go through actually go through. So it may end up being that you don't need that shift in order for things to change."", ""Jason Moser: Maybe not. Ultimately you want deals like this to prove value. But you have be careful. There are plenty of examples out there where the big get bigger, and ultimately they get so big that it really starts to limit the options for consumers, and that's what we don't want."", ""Deidre Woollard: Cigna has talked a little bit too, or there have been stories about potential smaller acquisitions and little tuck-ins and bolt on. So you never know what could happen in terms of maybe Humana spins off something or some part of it ends up being in there. So it doesn't have to be the full thing in order for these companies to keep talking."", ""Jason Moser: Exactly. If Microsoft and Activision Blizzard figured out a way to make it work. I think anything's possible at this point."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to ask a related question about that. Thinking about stock buybacks, we want to see a stock buyback when shares are cheap. Cigna saw 10 billion, they said they're going to buy back five billion before the middle of 2024. So they put a relatively short time line on it. It's cheap now, but it's not super cheap. And certainly today it's not as cheap because it's [laughs] gone up on the news. But is this buyback a signal that they don't see anything else worth spending capital on and do you want them to buy back no matter what, even if the shares maybe aren't as cheap as they were?"", ""Jason Moser: I'm sure employees of the business could probably make a case for some of that capital being diverted to them. I think that's always something that I think is worth entertaining for these businesses, particularly as they get larger. But with that said, to your point on valuation on the shares. They're down around 10% year to date, 15 times earnings, around two times book value, seven times free cash flow. It's absolutely not an expensive-looking stock, and this is a company with a long history of repurchasing shares. Share counts down over 23%. Over the last five years alone, they've spent $22 billion on repurchases since then. So this is not their first rodeo, so to speak. So I think this is something you get with a business like this. They are looking for ways to return value to shareholders. Share repurchases are one of the ways they can do that. And at least the repurchases are having the intended effect. The share count down 23%. That's nothing to seize at."", ""Deidre Woollard: We've talked about two deals that weren't. Do you think there's going to be one or two more big deals before the year ends?"", ""Jason Moser: Honestly deal that I'm following, which is just to me a fascinating soap opera, is this entire PGA Live Tour thing. Bringing in this new consortium of sports owners who are trying to figure out their way to participate in this along with Pith and the Saudis. And they set the target for December 31st. Well that's not something that should have a big impact on public markets. It could have second-order implications on the content that we're getting and whatnot. So that's the one I'm really keeping my eye on."", ""Deidre Woollard: How awesome we'll have to talk to you after the year ends to figure out what happened next with that one."", 'Jason Moser: You got it.', 'Deidre Woollard: Thanks for the time today, Jason.', 'Jason Moser: Thank you.', ""Dylan Lewis: Hey Motley Fool Money Listeners, host Dylan Lewis here.

Matt Frankel and Ricky Mulvey they explore the potential of this conglomerate in the making.', 'Ricky Mulvey: So Matt, Boston Omaha has its arms in a number of different businesses. It can be a little bit of a difficult business to understand. Can you do the quick introduction?', ""Matt Frankel: It's an interesting company because Boston Omaha itself doesn't really do a whole lot. It's a holding company. In the sense that Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company. It doesn't really have much of its own businesses, but owns a lot of other things. So there's four main parts of Boston Omaha's business. It has its billboard rental business, which is called Link Media. It's pretty widespread in the Midwest area. If you're ever driving through Omaha itself, you'll see a bunch of link billboards. They have an insurance business called General Indemnity which sells surety bonds. They have a fiber-to-the-home broadband business, which goes under a few different brand names depending on where it's located. And they also have Boston Omaha asset management, which is a collection of other assets the company owns. It owns a minority stake in a few businesses. It owns as the name implies an asset manager, and it owns a few other little interesting investments that it bundled into one division."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's focus on the asset management business. I think that's where at least I have some confusion. It has major projects and build-to-rent housing, broadband Internet, but it also has a lot of exposure in commercial real estate. I think that may be something that investors are reacting to right now. If you look at the website, it does say it has office investments, but I have trouble finding the story beyond that. So what's the commercial real estate story for Boston Omaha right now?"", ""Matt Frankel: They owned a minority stake in an investment manager called 24th Street Asset Management and recently acquired the rest of it. They acquired the whole thing. It's included in Boston Omaha asset management. Now they had minority exposure, now they have direct exposure. 24 Street asset management operates to closed end funds today. As you mentioned, there is some office exposure. It's not a ton. Are the investments a concern? We don't really know the details. It's been a private business till now, so they don't have to report what the funds are doing to anybody. There's a lot that we don't know about it, which I think is more than the office performance itself. I think the fact that we really don't know a whole lot about their commercial real estate dealings so far, is giving investors concern."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It goes back to, what's the old saying? I'm not mad because of what you did, I'm mad because you didn't tell me."", ""Matt Frankel: Right. There's a lot of that with Boston Omaha. I'm sure we'll talk about this a little more, but they don't communicate very well with investors. They don't host earnings calls, they don't do things like that, and I think that plays a lot into the stock performance. They're trying to be very Buffetesque, which I get, [LAUGHTER] but it doesn't seem to be working."", ""Ricky Mulvey: We'll get to that. We're in a little bit of a negative place, and they don't communicate well, they have unknown commercial real estate exposure, but I know you're a Boston Omaha bull, so what's your long term thesis then for Boston Omaha?"", ""Matt Frankel: For me, the asset management business is the big potential area. I like the billboard business. The billboard business and broadband businesses especially have fantastic economics. Their broadband business. They're doing fiber to the home broadband, so it's essentially a one time capital outlay and then it's a great cash flow generator, so that business can have 90% gross margins over time. Those are three great businesses that they participate in. The asset management business is really the X factor here. They own a stake in a company called Sky Harbor. That's the biggest investment the company has made to date. But the real potential is what they're trying to do in built for rent housing and broadband, which you alluded to earlier in the sense that they're trying to raise outside capital to invest. This can be a home run source of revenue if things go correctly. It's a big if. But for example, let's say you raise $100, million from outside investors to invest in built for rent housing, you end up doubling that over a period of five years. If you agree to get, say 10 percent of any investment profits, that's a $10 million windfall that you didn't have to put up any of your own capital or assets for. Now, imagine if you're doing that over time with $1 billion of investor money, your $10 billion of investor money like some of the bigger players do. If you establish a track record in asset management, that's where the real X factor lies because it's really asset capital, and then all the other businesses can generate capital to help grow that side of the business because they do want to invest alongside all of their outside investors."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Right now the biggest revenue driver is the billboard business, but the key part with the asset management that I do give them props for is that they invest a lot of their own money alongside the folks who are in those funds.', ""Matt Frankel: That's a big part of their thesis, is that they want to benefit when their investors do well, but also to share if their investors go down, a lot of skin in the game, which we really like to see here."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Right now the company is in a little bit of an interesting spot especially as a asset management business, a collection of businesses because the price is trading below its book value, which is just the accounting value of its assets minus its liabilities. We'll get back to Boston Omaha in a sec, but why is it significant, in general, for any business, especially one like this to trade below its book value?"", ""Matt Frankel: One, book value doesn't do a great job of valuing a business like this. I mentioned Berkshire. Berkshire has said that book value is garbage right now. It used to base its buyback plan off book value, and it doesn't use that anymore, for example, but it usually underestimates the company's value. For a company like this to be trading below its book value, it's odd. Boston Omaha hasn't traded below book value as a public company, even during the initial COVID crash, it never got below its book value. I'm shaking my head a little bit on this as well. A lot of it's that the market doesn't know how to value it, a lot of it's because the market doesn't know about its office assets and things like that like you mentioned. It's a rare case because the stocks have been drawn down about 50% this year while the market's done well, so I'm shaking my head a bit."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I know you've written about this a couple of times where, what is it? There's two Wall Street analysts who follow this company, so maybe it's tough to tell what investors are discounting about it. I have to think there's something beyond just it being in the two hard pile in potentially a little bit of office real estate."", ""Matt Frankel: A lot of people do put it in the two hard pile. It's a very long term focused investment to an extreme case. A lot of companies I invest in say, Bank of America, that's definitely a long-term investment, but in the meantime, they pay me a dividend, they hold quarterly earnings calls, they make money, things like that. This is an extreme long term investment, which a lot of people don't really know how to value. I do think a lot of people put it in the two hard basket and I'm hoping they'll regret being wrong."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Right now while the market's been up, this company has taken a downturn in 2023. One move for these capital allocators. To be transparent, I own some shares in Boston Omaha, but it also has me shaking my head a bit, which is that they're issuing shares for cash right now. They're building up their cash reserve, and as the stock has gone down, they're issuing more and more shares to grow that cash pile. What's going on here? What's the capital allocation strategy that I don't understand?"", ""Matt Frankel: To be fair, I'll push back a little bit on that. They haven't issued any new shares for the past two quarters. As the bulk of the 2023 drawdown has happened, they've stopped issuing shares. I spoke to a Alex Rozek, the CEO, recently, and he specifically said that's not a desirable way to raise capital right now. Credit where it's due. I wish they would do a buyback or a tender offer or something to put investors in the other direction who feel the same way you have because you're right, in the past, say year, they've done a lot more of selling shares for cash than buying back shares without any clear use for the money because at the time they sold shares, say in the first quarter, they already had something like $50 million in the bank, which for a sub $500 million company is a lot. Why? Did they think the stock was too expensive at that point? Which is where investors heads go. I don't think that was their rationale, and they addressed this at their annual meeting a little bit, but it does make you question why they're selling shares."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Especially, what was it? A year ago, what was it? I think the leaders said this, where it was like, we have simply too many opportunities.', ""Matt Frankel: That was the whole rationale behind launching Boston Omaha asset management, like the raising outside capital. They mentioned broadband specifically. They see $500 million of opportunities to attack, and they obviously can't do that with their own capital. Instead of raising $500 million by selling shares, raising outside capital to help invest in that is more desirable."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Speaking of investor communication, you mentioned you had a conversation with Co-CEO Alex Rozek, what did you learn?', ""Matt Frankel: Apparently instead of having earnings calls, they just talk to me for an hour or so. No, all jokes aside, I love that they're very approachable CEO's, even at their annual meeting. It's not like the Berkshire annual meeting. Anyone can walk up to the CEO's, and just have a conversation. It's very open communication in that sense. But like you said, the company does not host earnings calls. They generally don't talk to analysts, maybe me, but they really don't talk to analysts. They don't give commentary in their earnings reports. They issue quarterly earnings reports, but there's no like management quotes that are usually at the top of earnings reports. Alex even acknowledged to me that they need to do a better job of communication, but he doesn't really know what that should look like. How do you increase communication while still saying, don't worry about the quarterly numbers and things like that as much? It is a balancing act, but he agrees the market really doesn't know how to value the stock. Just to give you a fun example, I mentioned they own a lot of Sky Harbor. Sky Harbor makes up almost 30% of Boston, Omaha's market cap right now. There was a three day period a couple of weeks ago where Sky Harbor went up 40% and Boston Omaha stock didn't budge. It should have been up like 15% in that time because if Apple went up by 20 to 30%, Berkshire Hathaway stock would probably go up too because it own so much of it. It's just a head scratcher in a lot of ways because the market really doesn't seem to know what to do here."", 'Ricky Mulvey: To backtrack just a sec. Sky Harbor, they own private hangers for private jets going in and out at different airports.', ""Matt Frankel: Sky Harbor, to my knowledge, I don't know if you know any Ricky, but out of the big SPACs boom, I don't know any SPACs that are trading for more than their $10 initial price other than Sky Harbor. That's one of their few success stories."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I'd have to start Googling and that's terrible podcasting. I think I want to leave it with this question. Boston Omaha, really? I would say there is a welcome comparison to Berkshire Hathaway. They got Omaha in the name. There's the familial connection with Warren Buffett, but I don't know, do you think it's earned that swagger to not host quarterly earnings calls, not talk to analysts? Why not pre-announce your earnings date and make it a little bit easier for the investors trying to follow your company?"", ""Matt Frankel: I would have to say no, they have not earned that type of swagger yet. With Berkshire it certainly makes sense. Buffett's mentality is, I've doubled the annualized returns of the S&P for over 50 years, shut up and trust the process. He's earned the right to say that. But even when the sky is falling, Buffett's out on CNBC, calming investors down. I feel you need to earn some track record to get to that point.

The MSCI index tracking Latin American stocks edged down 0.3% by 1452 GMT. The equity index is set for an annual gain of 25%, its best year since 2016. A basket of regional currencies was down 0.2% against the dollar and set for annual gains of about 23%, its best year since 2009. The dollar index, however, is set to fall 2%, snapping a two-year winning streak. Latin American assets are set for a strong end to the year after the U.S. Federal Reserve's dovish stance was followed by positive economic data, which bolstered hopes of rate cuts as early as March. Across emerging markets, the Colombian peso is set to be the best-performing currency with annual gains of 25%, its best year since 2004, while the Mexican peso is on track for a yearly gain of 15%, taking the title of the second-best performing currency and set for its best year since 1990. Among stocks, Brazil's Bovespa index, the Peruvian Lima Index and Mexico's IPC stocks index are set to post yearly gains of 22%, 21% and about 19% respectively. Argentina's Merval index rose 1.5%, while one of the most influential workers unions in Argentina has called for a national strike next month as opposition to the government's overhaul of the economy builds. Earlier this week, Argentine President Javier Milei sent a reform bill to Congress proposing far-reaching changes to the country's tax system, electoral law and public debt management. On the data front, Brazil's jobless rate fell to 7.5% in the three months through November, in line with market expectations. Copper output in Chile, the world's largest producer of the red metal, decreased 3.1% year-on-year in November to 444,905 metric tons. For the day, among regional bourses, the Bovespa index was muted, Chilean stocks fell 0.7% and Colombia's Colcap index was up 0.6%. The Brazilian real was down 0.5%, the Mexican peso ticked up 0.3% and the Chilean peso climbed 1.5% for the day.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$145.0m', 'US$721.3m', 'US$798.3m', 'US$855.7m', 'US$904.5m', 'US$946.6m', 'US$983.8m', 'US$1.02b', 'US$1.05b', 'US$1.08b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 7.20%', 'Est @ 5.70%', 'Est @ 4.66%', 'Est @ 3.93%', 'Est @ 3.41%', 'Est @ 3.06%', 'Est @ 2.81%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% ', 'US$132', 'US$594', 'US$597', 'US$580', 'US$557', 'US$529', 'US$499', 'US$468', 'US$438', 'US$409', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.8b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

Given that we are looking at Macy's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.594. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Zoetis ', 'The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Zoetis had US$6.59b in debt in September 2023; about the same as the year before. However, it also had US$1.75b in cash, and so its net debt is US$4.84b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Zoetis had liabilities of US$1.61b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$7.42b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.75b as well as receivables valued at US$1.26b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$6.02b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', 'Of course, Zoetis has a titanic market capitalization of US$90.5b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.', ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Zoetis's net debt is only 1.4 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 23.0 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Zoetis has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Zoetis can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Zoetis produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 53% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""The good news is that Zoetis's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And its net debt to EBITDA is good too. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Zoetis takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that  Zoetis is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about..."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

The S&P 500 bounced back sharply from a tough 2022, rallying by about 25%. ', 'Unfortunately, not all stocks rode that rally, and for some, 2023 was an abysmal year. That was certainly the case for NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) and Medical Properties Trust (NYSE: MPW), both of which lost more than half their value in the past 12 months. ', 'But I believe 2024 will be much better for those two. In fact, they are my highest-upside stock picks for the coming year. ', 'NextEra Energy Partners has been under tremendous pressure over the past year. Previously, the renewable energy producer had been growing briskly by acquiring cash-flow-generating renewable energy assets from its parent, leading utility NextEra Energy, as well as third-party sellers. It funded those deals with cheap financing.', ""Among the types of funding vehicles it used were convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF) arrangements with institutional investors. Those CEPFs have started maturing at a time when NextEra Energy Partners' cost of capital has risen due both to soaring interest rates and its slumping stock price. As a result, selling shares to redeem its CEPFs was becoming too dilutive, and it didn't have the balance sheet strength to issue debt at attractive rates to buy back those funding vehicles."", 'This forced NextEra Energy Partners to shift gears. It decided to sell its natural gas pipeline assets and use the proceeds to redeem its CEFPs and fund new renewable energy investments. The company also pivoted its growth strategy from acquisitions to organic investments, primarily repowering existing wind farms. These actions slowed its growth, leading management to reduce its dividend growth outlook through 2026 from a range of 12% to 15% annually to a range of 5% to 8% annually with a target of 6%. ', 'NextEra Energy Partners has already made solid progress on its plan. It recently agreed to sell its STX Midstream business to Kinder Morgan for $1.8 billion in cash. That deal will enable it to pay off project-related debt, pay down its credit facility (which it used to fund the recent buyouts of $582 million worth of CEPFs), and complete the $1.1 billion of remaining buyouts of its NEP Renewables II CEPF by June 2025. The company plans to sell its remaining gas pipeline assets by 2025 to buy out the rest of its CEPFs as they mature and fund acquisitions. ', 'Meanwhile, a major headwind for NextEra Energy Partners (rising interest rates) should lift in 2024 as the Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting them. That should make it less expensive to roll over maturing debt, which will in turn lift some of the weight off its stock price.', ""Medical Properties Trust has faced a couple of major headwinds: higher interest rates and tenant-related issues. Rising rates are making it more expensive for the real estate investment trust (REIT) to refinance its maturing debt, while tenant issues have impacted the company's cash flow."", ""The healthcare REIT has taken several steps to address its issues. It has worked directly with troubled tenants to help them get through their financial issues. For example, it restructured its investment in Prospect Medical, exchanging a stake in that company's managed care business for some hospital properties. Medical Properties Trust has also sold several properties to repay debt. In addition, it cut its dividend by roughly 50% to retain additional cash to repay debt. "", 'These moves have enabled the company to raise all the money needed to repay its upcoming debt maturities through 2024. Meanwhile, its cash flow has started to improve now that Prospect is making partial rental payments on the California hospitals it leases from the REIT (with full rent payments scheduled to resume in March). ', ""Medical Properties Trust plans to sell additional assets in 2024 to help fund future debt maturities. Meanwhile, with interest rates likely to fall, it won't be quite as expensive to refinance debt in the future. As its cost of capital declines, the REIT will be able to start growing its portfolio again by making new investments. Those catalysts could drive its stock price skyward in 2024. "", ""NextEra Energy Partners and Medical Properties Trust were under a lot of pressure in 2023 due in part to higher interest rates. However, that headwind should fade in 2024. On top of that, they're both making moves to address their issues. Because of that, their shares could bounce back big time in the coming year. While they're certainly higher-risk stocks, they have significant upside potential. Add in their big-time dividends (with yields currently in the double-digit percentages), and they could produce monster total returns in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy Partners wasn't one of them.

It offers classic and boneless wings, tenders and chicken sandwiches, which are cooked to order and hand sauced-and-tossed in 11 different flavors.', 'It also has signature sides including fresh-cut, seasoned fries and ranch and bleu cheese dips.', 'On Nov 1, 2023, Wingstop reported its fiscal third quarter 2023 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus for the 6th consecutive quarter. Earnings were $0.69 versus the consensus of just $0.52, for a $0.17 beat.', 'Domestic same-store-sales, a key metric in the restaurant industry, rose 15.3% year-over-year primarily due to transaction growth.', 'System-wide sales increased 26.5% to $885 million.', 'Wingstop saw a benefit as the cost of bone-in chicken wings fell 13.5% compared to the year ago quarter.', '""We are measuring record levels in brand health metrics, demonstrating the underlying momentum at Wingstop, and putting us on a path to deliver our 20th consecutive year of domestic same-store sales growth,"" said Michael Skipworth, President and CEO.', 'The board had previously approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $250 million of the outstanding shares. Pursuant to that program, Wingstop also entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""ASR Agreement"") to repurchase $125 million of its common stock.', 'During the fiscal third quarter, Wingstop made the initial payment of $125 million and retired 567,151 shares of its common stock under the ASR Agreement. This represented about 75% of the total shares expected to be delivered under the ASR agreement.', 'The delivery of the remaining shares is expected to take place in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. But as of Sep 30, 2023, the company had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases under the program of about $125 million.', ""Wingstop said it continued to see momentum in its business. It raised domestic same-store-sales growth to approximately 16% from its previous guidance of 10% to 12%.

The shares are not cheap. Wingstop trades with a forward P/E of 109 and has a PEG ratio of 5.0.

The Federal Reserve's intention to trim interest rates in 2024, following signs that inflation is ebbing, gave the stock market the wherewithal to scale northward."", ""The U.S. economy, meanwhile, registered the best quarterly gains in almost two years in the third quarter, while the labor market remained strong and consumer outlays picked up.

However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.', 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon ', ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the General Counsel, Jane McCarthy, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$46.33 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$52.05, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign.

The higher interest rate regime propelled the banks’ top-line growth in 2022.', 'However, as higher interest rates hurt bond values, many banks with notable portfolios of bond investments were affected. Hence, as the year progressed, the fallout from the central bank’s ultra-aggressive monetary policy started emerging. Moreover, increasing funding costs, potential recession, asset-liability mismatches, high exposure to fixed-rate mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans and uninsured deposits on the balance sheet resulted in the regional banking crisis in early March with the fall of three large banks, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. These lenders were part of the S&P 500 Index.', 'Such challenges turned investors bearish toward the banking stocks. As the ultra-aggressive pace of rate hikes turned counterproductive for banks that generally perform well in the higher interest rate regime, the Fed pausing the interest rate hike at the June FOMC meeting helped regain some confidence in bank stocks.', 'Now, at the end of the two-day FOMC meeting earlier this month, the Fed signaled an end to rate hikes this cycle. In fact, the central bank is now expected to cut rates thrice in 2024. With this, bank stocks navigated choppy waters and investors gradually turned optimistic toward banks.', 'So far this year, the S&P Banks Select Industry Index has risen 3.5%, lagging the S&P 500 Index’s rally of 25.1%. Today, we will discuss the three best-performing S&P 500 banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, Wells Fargo & Company WFC and Bank of New York Mellon Corporation BK or BNY Mellon.', 'Before we proceed to check out these three top-performing banks in detail, let’s see how they have fared. The chart below shows the price performance of these banks in the year-to-date period.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'JPMorgan Chase: This banking behemoth tapped an opportunity to strengthen its balance sheet amid turbulence in the banking space. JPMorgan acquired First Republic Bank, the third largest bank to collapse in 2023, for $10.6 billion in an FDIC-assisted deal.', 'Following the transaction, JPMorgan’s balance sheet has swelled to almost $3.9 trillion. The deal resulted in increased penetration within the high-net-worth clients and added prime locations in wealthy markets.', 'While high interest rates hindered net interest income (NII) for numerous banks on higher funding costs, First Republic Bank’s acquisition drove robust improvement in JPM’s NII. In the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, the company’s NII jumped 40% to $65.2 billion.', 'Given the encouraging momentum, JPMorgan kept on raising its 2023 NII outlook. It expects 2023 NII to be roughly $88.5 billion, up from the prior guidance of $87 billion. The increase is driven by higher rates and slower-than-expected deposit repricing across both consumers and wholesale.', 'Coming to investment banking (IB) activities, despite the muted deal-making scenario, JPMorgan continued to rank #1 for global IB fees with an 8.6% wallet share in the first nine months of 2023. The company is seeing encouraging signs in the IB business, which is likely to rebound and grow at a decent pace once the macroeconomic and geopolitical ambiguity is over. Improvement in the macro scenario, along with a healthy IB pipeline and active merger & acquisition (M&A) market, will likely facilitate IB fee growth.', 'Also, JPMorgan Chase’s efforts to embrace new technologies and make investments in fintech companies are positive.', 'Lastly, the company increased its dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share in 2023 and announced its intention to repurchase shares worth $12 billion this year. This, too, is likely to have driven investors’ confidence in the stock.', 'The stock has gained 26.9% this year. The company’s earnings are projected to witness a year-over-year rise of 38.4% this year on 22.9% growth in revenues. It currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).', 'Wells Fargo: Operating with an asset cap that is limiting balance-sheet growth, WFC has made impressive efforts in regard to expense management. Efforts such as streamlining organizational structure, closing branches, and reducing headcount undertaken from third-quarter 2020 have been aiding expense reduction. With this, it witnessed a declining trend in expenses in the first nine months of 2023.', 'Similar to JPM, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank revised its NII outlook upward. It now expects 2023 NII to increase about 16% compared with the previous forecast of 14% growth.', 'Also, Wells Fargo’s capital deployment activities continue to impress shareholders. Following the clearance of the 2023 stress test, the company increased its dividend by 16.7% to 35 cents per share in July. Also, on Jul 25, 2023, its board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program worth $30 billion. As of the third-quarter end, it had $29 billion authorization remaining.', 'So far this year, shares of WFC have gained 19.8%. The earnings estimate for WFC for 2023 has witnessed a downward revision of 2.3% over the past week to $5.08. Nonetheless, it indicates year-over-year growth of 61.8%. Also, revenues are projected to be up 11.7% in 2023. The company currently has a Zacks Rank of 3.

The company’s net interest revenues (NIR) and margins witnessed an uptrend in the first nine months of 2023. Encouragingly, for 2023, management expects NIR to be up 20% year over year.', 'Also, global expansion initiatives, robust assets under management balance, business restructuring efforts, solid balance sheet and digitization of operations have aided performance.', 'BNY Mellon’s capital distribution activities seem impressive.

The dollar index, however, is set to fall 2%, snapping a two-year winning streak. Latin American assets are set for a strong end to the year after the U.S. Federal Reserve's dovish stance was followed by positive economic data, which bolstered hopes of rate cuts as early as March. Across emerging markets, the Colombian peso is set to be the best-performing currency with annual gains of 25%, its best year since 2004, while the Mexican peso is on track for a yearly gain of 15%, taking the title of the second-best performing currency and set for its best year since 1990.

As consumers continue their transition journey toward digital methods of payments, payment processing companies stand to benefit from higher transaction volumes and improved transaction processing fees. Per Fidelity Information Service’s Global Payments Report, cash is estimated to account for less than 13% of overall payments across the globe.', 'Continued innovation, enhanced security of transactions and expansion initiatives should continue to benefit payment companies like Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc.\xa0V, American Express Company AXP and Global Payments Inc. GPN.', 'Per Mastercard Economics Institute (MEI), the year 2024 will be characterized by easing inflation and a relatively stable labor market fueling consumer spending. As inflation pressure softens across most global economies, consumers will be able to expend more, benefiting companies in the payments space. MEI expects the consumer price index, measuring inflation, to cool down to 4.9% globally in 2024 from 6% in 2023. Although this number will be higher than the pre-pandemic trend of 2.7%, consumer spending should not take a hit as signaled by improved travel-related spending post-pandemic and growth in U.S. retail sales in the 2023 holiday season amid inflationary pressures.', 'Companies in the payments space often resort to mergers and acquisitions strategy, reaping the benefits of diversification. Diversifying around products or geographical markets protects them from resorting to a few selected products or geographies, insulating their top line from unfavorable shocks. Visa and Mastercard undertake several opportunities to expand their geographical reach to new regions and expand business inorganically. The industry has also been undertaking significant technological investments aimed at modernizing the digital payments space.', 'Companies dealing with billions of transactions have the responsibility to protect data. Hence, enhanced security turns out to be an important value proposition for payment companies.

Tap to Pay and virtual cards introduced by the companies should act as a key innovation, enhancing its offerings and providing better security. Per Mastercard, virtual cards should bring in savings of 50 cents to $14 per transaction.', 'Amid the looming tensions in the regulatory environment of reducing swipe fees, companies have held their positions firm. Mastercard believes if the swipe fees are reduced, it will have a negative impact on small businesses and consumers. Companies in the payments space utilize the funds generated from swipe fees to enhance security measures and provide reward programs. Curtailing on such a source of revenue might impact the security of transactions, thereby impacting these companies’ core value proposition. Firms in the payments industry are also keeping up with the trends by aiming to gain from technologies like Generative AI, which would transform fraud detection measures.', 'Although the regulatory environment and high interchange fee pressures still linger, a strong labor market and stable inflation level should help in improving the purchasing power of the consumer, benefiting payment companies.', '4 Top Stocks to Watch', 'Here we have picked four payment stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and have the potential to retain a purple patch going forward.

For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.', ' See our latest analysis for Expedia Group ', ""We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$2.15b', 'US$2.42b', 'US$1.94b', 'US$2.10b', 'US$2.08b', 'US$2.07b', 'US$2.08b', 'US$2.10b', 'US$2.13b', 'US$2.16b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x10', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x3', 'Est @ -1.36%', 'Est @ -0.29%', 'Est @ 0.47%', 'Est @ 0.99%', 'Est @ 1.36%', 'Est @ 1.62%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% ', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$1.5k', 'US$1.5k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.3k', 'US$1.2k', 'US$1.1k', 'US$1.0k', 'US$956', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Expedia Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.258. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

It's no surprise then to see a number of attractive holdings that have passed through the portfolio of the company he leads, Berkshire Hathaway. For investors looking for inspiration, it's a good idea to peek at Berkshire's holdings occasionally."", ""Let's look at two positions -- one current and one former -- that have made it into Buffett's portfolio at various times and are worth considering today: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)."", ""Johnson & Johnson has already passed the test of time. The healthcare giant has been around for over 100 years. While it's no longer in Buffett's portfolio, the drugmaker still has many of the qualities that allowed it to succeed in the past."", ""First, it has been incredibly picky with its leaders. Johnson & Johnson has had seven CEOs since it became a publicly traded company in 1944. A corporation's leadership team is one of the most important factors for its success. The drugmaker has always made sure to select qualified leaders who have generally served for a long time. The current CEO, Joaquin Duato, officially took that post in January 2022."", ""Second, J&J is a highly innovative company. It continues to develop newer and better medicines and medical devices. Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical pipeline includes 94 ongoing programs, some of which are brand-new therapies. These often lead to new approvals, such as that of Akeega, a cancer medicine that hit the shelves for the first time this year."", ""Johnson & Johnson's late-stage pipeline includes such products as potential stroke prevention medicine milvexian, and AAV-RPGR, a potential gene therapy for a rare eye disease. With the company having recently spun off its consumer health unit, it plans to dedicate even more funds to research and development in its pharmaceutical and medical device units, which should pay off down the line."", 'Third, Johnson & Johnson has deep footprints in the healthcare industry, which is highly regulated and challenging to navigate. Those factors, and others, should allow the company to remain in business -- and perform relatively well -- for many more years.', ""Of course, investors can't ignore J&J's incredible dividend track record. The company has now raised its payouts for 61 consecutive years as part of the elite club of Dividend Kings. There aren't that many better income stocks on the market, whether investors want passive income on the side or to boost their returns over long periods by opting to reinvest their dividends."", ""Johnson & Johnson's current dividend yield of 3.07% is notably higher than the S&P 500's average of 1.62%, while its cash payout of 75% looks a little high but should be manageable. Johnson & Johnson has had its share of legal issues, which, in my view, the company will be able to handle. Over the long run, the drugmaker is still in an excellent position to deliver stability, solid returns, and competitive dividends."", ""There's no way to know for certain, but perhaps these legal troubles partly explain why Berkshire Hathaway recently shed its position in the healthcare stock. However, Berkshire has bought and sold the stock on several occasions before. Buffett has generally focused on the sectors he knows best, and healthcare stocks have never been a large part of his company's portfolio."", ""Still, due to its solid position in an industry that won't die out anytime soon, not to mention its amazing dividend program, Johnson & Johnson remains a top pick for long-term investors."", ""Apple has been one of Buffett's favorite stocks for a while. The tech giant accounts for a large percentage of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Several factors make Apple such an outstanding stock for long-term investors. Despite selling electronic devices that aren't necessary items and have plenty of substitutes, Apple has made itself hard to replace."", ""Besides the company's strong brand name and high customer loyalty, Apple has a thing for adding its ingenious spin on existing technologies, starting new trends, and drawing customers in. In addition, it offers a set of perks to those who use its devices, including a range of entertainment services, many of which they would have to give up if they decided to drop Apple. In other words, the company benefits from high switching costs."", ""Apple's large installed base of more than 2 billion devices is arguably where its most lucrative long-term opportunities lie. The company will increasingly seek to come up with new and improved ways to monetize its customer base -- the possibilities here are practically endless. Apple is dabbling in healthcare, fintech, and several other areas."", ""Further, Apple is also an excellent dividend stock. Though it isn't a Dividend King, it has raised its payouts by 120% in the past 10 years. Apple also has a great track record of improving its revenue, earnings, and cash flow."", ""While the iPhone no longer generates the attention it once did, it is still the company's biggest earner while it continues to expand its high-margin services segment. Apple seems to have some of the tools necessary to succeed in the next 10 years and beyond."", 'A solid economic moat, multiple growth paths, and the ability to generate plenty of free cash flow to reinvest into its business.

Psychedelics have the potential to alter or intensify sensory perceptions, thought processes, and energy levels, often facilitating spiritual experiences. They are classified into two main groups: empathogens and dissociative drugs (e.g., PCP) and serotonergic substances (e.g., LSD).

It was founded more than a century ago in 1896 by Charles Dow, the editor of the Wall Street Journal at the time. Originally, the Dow comprised just twelve companies that were commodity-focused. In 1928, the index was expanded to 30 stocks. It is a price-weighted index, unlike other market indexes which weigh businesses on their market capitalizations of businesses.\xa0', 'In a stock market filled with uncertainty, investments in the Dow are great for stability and defense. However, in a bull market, the Dow cannot always compete with the growth of other indexes that are more tech heavy. For example, so far this year, the market has responded positively to steady interest rates and slowing inflation. The benchmark S&P 500 has returned more than 24% to investors year-to-date. The NASDAQ Composite has outplaced even the S&P 500, returning over 44% to investors. The Dow has returned around 13%.\xa0', 'However, these numbers do not tell the whole story. The Dow has actually shined for value investors over the long term, unlike the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. For example, despite stellar returns in 2023, the S&P 500 is still slightly off the peak it achieved in early 2022. The NASDAQ is actually down by 5%.

Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share.

Psychedelics have the potential to alter or intensify sensory perceptions, thought processes, and energy levels, often facilitating spiritual experiences.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average, also known as Dow Jones or Dow, is one of the oldest and most followed equity indexes of the United States stock market. It was founded more than a century ago in 1896 by Charles Dow, the editor of the Wall Street Journal at the time. Originally, the Dow comprised just twelve companies that were commodity-focused. In 1928, the index was expanded to 30 stocks. It is a price-weighted index, unlike other market indexes which weigh businesses on their market capitalizations of businesses.\xa0', 'In a stock market filled with uncertainty, investments in the Dow are great for stability and defense. However, in a bull market, the Dow cannot always compete with the growth of other indexes that are more tech heavy. For example, so far this year, the market has responded positively to steady interest rates and slowing inflation. The benchmark S&P 500 has returned more than 24% to investors year-to-date. The NASDAQ Composite has outplaced even the S&P 500, returning over 44% to investors. The Dow has returned around 13%.\xa0', 'However, these numbers do not tell the whole story. The Dow has actually shined for value investors over the long term, unlike the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. For example, despite stellar returns in 2023, the S&P 500 is still slightly off the peak it achieved in early 2022. The NASDAQ is actually down by 5%. The Dow sits handsomely above both these indexes with returns of around 3% during this time span.

By the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at Optum Health, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on Optum Rx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third-quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year."", 'The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models. This year, we expect Optum Health will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago.

But then along came SpaceX.', 'Advertising launch prices as low as $67 million to put 22 tons of cargo in low Earth orbit with its Falcon 9 rocket, and developing a Starship vehicle that could launch 5 times more cargo for $2 million or less, SpaceX is making real progress toward its goal of lowering the cost of space travel by a factor of 100.', ""Granted, Starship still hasn't conducted a successful test flight to orbit. But it's getting close. And for rival launch company United Launch Alliance -- a joint venture between Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)\xa0-- time is running out to field a rocket that can compete with SpaceX on cost."", ""But here's the good news for Boeing and Lockheed Martin shareholders: ULA may have done just that. It now appears to have a rocket that can compete with SpaceX on cost."", 'And its name is Vulcan Centaur.', 'If you recall, ULA\'s Delta IV Heavy was the ""$400 million rocket"" that SpaceX ridiculed in Congressional hearings back in 2015. But the Delta IV family has since been shut down, and the rocket ULA chose to replace it, the Vulcan Centaur, costs quite a bit less.', 'In 2016, ULA CEO Tory Bruno set a goal of building and launching Vulcan Centaur for less than $100 million. On the face of it, that might not seem particularly aspirational. It fails to match, much less beat, the $67 million launch price that SpaceX advertises. On the other hand, getting costs down from $400 million to $100 million would still be a vast improvement. And in the context of the U.S. government national security launches -- which usually cost more than commercial launches -- that ULA specializes in, $100 million might be good enough to keep ULA competitive with SpaceX.', 'Case in point: Last month, the U.S. Space Force announced a series of 21 launch contracts awarded to both SpaceX and ULA. Totaling $2.5 billion in value, the contracts were split between the leading space companies, with ULA winning 11 launches for $1.3 billion, and SpaceX bagging 10 launches for $1.2 billion.', ""Do the math. That's $120 million per launch for SpaceX... and only $118 million per launch for ULA."", ""Abracadabra: ULA just matched SpaceX's prices."", 'Well, sort of.', ""As CNBC pointed out last month, all 11 of ULA's launches will utilize the company's newer, cheaper Vulcan Centaur offering. SpaceX will launch seven Falcon 9s, and three Falcon Heavies -- jumbo-sized rockets equipped with two additional Falcon 9 boosters each, for which SpaceX charges an extra $30 million."", ""And, for those curious, here's the rundown of the 21 mission assignments: https://t.co/kuWSHzzr3q pic.twitter.com/0hLEknRGwf"", '-- Michael Sheetz (@thesheetztweetz) November 1, 2023', ""So the prices launches aren't 100% comparable. If all 10 SpaceX missions were slated to launch atop Falcon 9s, the cost would probably be closer to $1.1 billion total, or $110 million apiece. That means SpaceX launches still probably cost at least a little bit more than ULA."", ""But we're approaching the point where the difference in price is a mere rounding error."", 'Now, it remains to be seen what a first-time-ever parity in pricing between SpaceX prices and ULA will mean for Boeing and Lockheed Martin stocks, not least because Boeing and Lockheed Martin might sell ULA to another company in the next few weeks.', ""Still, for the sake of argument, assume that Boeing and Lockheed don't sell ULA -- or at least don't sell it right away. In that case, you might assume that lower launch prices will mean less revenue and less profit for these two defense giants, which own ULA, to split in the future."", ""That's not necessarily the case, however. True, S&P Global Market Intelligence data show that Lockheed's space revenue has declined over the past couple of years as competition from SpaceX forced prices down. Also true, Lockheed's space profit margins have eroded,\xa0 down from 12.6% in 2015, before SpaceX began competing on national security missions, to just 8.8% last year. The same is probably true for Boeing, but Boeing doesn't break out the numbers for its space business."", ""But if Vulcan Centaur costs less to build and operate than ULA's older Atlas and Delta rockets, then revenue might stop falling -- and profit margin might even rise once Vulcan starts launching."", ""That's the outcome Boeing and Lockheed investors should be hoping for, and thanks to Tory Bruno for delivering on his promise to cut launch prices, it's a realistic hope."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lockheed Martin wasn't one of them.

Peter, it's great to speak with you. I'd love to get your insights around this. Because if you're a purchaser of Boeing 737 MAX planes-- and they have just come off of a stretch of a few months where they've seen a good amount of orders come through, both internationally and domestic airline operators too. All that considered, do you look at news like this and say ultimately, OK, that would deter us from exercising the options that they have later on down the line to take even more delivery?"", ""PETER MCNALLY: Well, I think the bigger issues were a few years ago with the 737 Max and the accidents of the disasters that they did happen. This could be a limited issue. But look, it's a single aisle plane. They compete with Airbus' 321. And it's the workhorse for leisure travel. So it's unlikely, I think at this point, based on what we know that there's any impact on the order book or anyone exercising orders. Because it's difficult to get a plane these days as supply chains have been stretched."", ""And I think we've seen that post-pandemic, people really do want to travel, and they want to travel by air. And that has made it a tremendous comeback. And airlines have invested in a lot of future capacity."", ""BRAD SMITH: Peter, I think you make a great point in that. Much of the-- and we were giving Boeing credit for this the other day too. Much of the pattern of negligence that existed under former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, now under Dave Calhoun instead, a lot of that's been erased. They've been able to get back into favor with many of their airline operator purchasers."", ""So for Boeing, which has seen the stock climb over the course of this year on some of those new orders, is this a company that's back in good favor with many of the operators? And now, how do they position themselves against A321neo that really is that head-to-head match-up, if you will, on the 737 MAX side?"", ""PETER MCNALLY: Well, there's a few things to unpack there. I think customers do have a lot more confidence in this management team. But there are a lot of growth expectations, and deliveries have been an issue. It can create some amount of frustration."", ""United Airlines, let's say, in particular have been particularly aggressive two-and-a-half years ago in ordering planes. They expected a lot more than they got this year, but they still got a lot. And that's expected to grow in the future. But the constraints really are there on Boeing suppliers at this point."", ""Now, as far as competition with Airbus, I mean, Boeing has lost ground. It's hard to see, talking to our experts at Third Bridge, how they're able to really make those big recoveries with lost customers. In Asia in particular, which is going to be a growth market for this industry, Airbus dominates orders."", ""And a lot of the supply chain is trained, pilots are trained, and it's going to be a lot more difficult for Airbus to make ground-- or I'm sorry, for Boeing to gain ground. Now that said, in the developed world Europe and the US, Boeing does great. And we would expect Boeing's 737 MAX to continue to serve those leisure travel clients.""]"

(NASDAQ:ILMN). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Illumina’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for Illumina ', 'According to our valuation model, Illumina seems to be fairly priced at around 11% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Illumina today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $159.56, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Illumina’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 97% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Illumina. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ILMN’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ILMN, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', 'Diving deeper into the forecasts for Illumina mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

It was the first time that has been done in over three decades. And the utility is about to do it again, in early 2024, when it attaches a second nuclear power plant to the grid. This is a huge event for investors looking at Southern, but there's a bigger story here that needs to be discussed before you buy the stock."", ""To say that Southern opening up Vogtle 3 and Vogtle 4, the two nuclear power plants it is building, is a big deal is an understatement. That's only partly because of the 30-plus year pause in the construction of new nuclear power plants in the United States. The other reason is that the path to achieving this was rocky at best."", ""Not only did the project face massive cost overruns, but it was also long delayed. At one point the company's primary contractor (Westinghouse) declared bankruptcy, effectively forcing Southern to take on that role. Then add in a global pandemic for good measure. In some regards, it is a miracle that the Vogtle project (as the two plants are collectively known) was completed at all. In fact, after the Westinghouse bankruptcy, a utility peer chose to stop construction of the nuclear plant it was building."", ""Southern's stock performance over the past year reflects the success it has achieved. Notably, shares have fallen just 3% or so versus the broader utility industry's decline of roughly 12%, using Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) as a proxy. That's a pretty impressive showing, though the stock spent a fair amount of time underperforming the energy sector during the troubled Vogtle construction process."", ""But there are big changes that will come about once Vogtle 4 is actually up and running. First off, the capital investment will end and the project will stop being a cash drain. Second, Vogtle 3 and 4 will start to generate cash flow, increasing Southern's cash flow from operations by around $700 million. Third, the company's fairly lofty dividend payout ratio (projected to be around 77% in 2023) will start to come down, which should eventually allow for a higher dividend growth rate at some point in the next few years. In other words, the investment story around Southern is changing dramatically."", ""But given the stock's relatively strong performance, it isn't the same deal it once was. While the 4% dividend yield is still higher than what's on offer from the average utility, it is now toward the low end of the company's yield range over the past decade. The big value opportunity is clearly past. The story now is about what the future will hold, which is likely more rapid dividend growth. The goal is to match dividend growth to earnings growth, but that likely won't happen for at least a year or two."", ""If you are a value investor, Southern probably won't interest you. If you are a dividend growth investor, Southern is more interesting, but the growth probably won't show up for a bit. That said, conservative dividend investors focused on dividend consistency might still like the stock given the opportunity for stronger dividend growth ahead and the company's seven-decade-plus streak of holding the dividend steady or increasing it. Southern probably won't excite you, but that's the point. And if you can handle collecting a still above-average 4% yield while you wait for the more rapid dividend growth that appears on tap, this reliable dividend stock could be a good fit for you."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Southern Company right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Southern Company, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Southern Company wasn't one of them.

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool Analyst, Jason Moser. Jason, how was your weekend?"", 'Jason Moser: It was a good weekend, Deidre. How about yours?', ""Deidre Woollard: Pretty good. Every Sunday though, I start looking at the laptop, I start wondering what the news is. Last few Sundays have been pretty good for me as a news junkie and did not disappoint this weekend. The hot rumor, the rumor that is dominating the stock market today too, is that Macy's might be acquired and taken private for $5.8 billion. This is with a couple of private equity funds, including Arkhouse management and Brigade Capital Management. The deal would be for premium of 32% for shareholders based on when the deal was brought up at the end of November, stock has been battered around for a bit. That is a premium based on where we were, but from where the stock has been over time, but then today the stock has been up practically to the level of $21 a share. Is this a deal that shareholders should want?"", ""Jason Moser: If I were a shareholder, which I'm not. But if I were, I would think so. Yes. We've talked about Macy's, I think for a number of years on these shows, we've always just come back to the same ultimate conclusion. It's a business that just remains challenged because maybe it's not really necessarily a Macy's world anymore. I think Ron Gross years back, asked the question, does the world really need JCPenney? When we were talking about JCPenney's woes. I feel that question more or less applies here to at least to a degree. Macy's has more or less been treading water here over the last several years, trying to figure out the most sensible path forward. I mean, when you look at the metrics, the numbers, it really does tell you a tale of a challenge business. You go back to 2014, a helped up revenue just under $28 billion. Today that's $23 billion. The margin picture just continues to get incrementally worse. Very concerning to me, cash and short term investments. Going back 10 years, it stood at 2.3 billion dollar today, $364 million. That is a massive cash burn and the stock is down 60% over that stretch. That's what the share account being down 25% as well. They bought back shares, brought that share account down. In theory, it's supposed to have the opposite impact. But this really goes back to just what we've been talking about Macy's. It's just a business that's living in a different retail world. I'm not necessarily certain the world needs it. Maybe it does, but if I'm a shareholder of Macy's today, I'm feeling pretty good about this offer and hoping that it goes through."", ""Deidre Woollard: That is a question I'm asking myself too is, do we still need department stores? I think we'll get into that in a little bit. I wanted to talk first about why this deal, and I feel like part of it is, it's the real estate and a lot of that is that Herald Square location, the famous big Macy's. Everyone knows the big Macy's. In 2021, they announced this plan to redevelop it. They've got a whole website dedicated to it. They're going to put this giant 900 foot office building on top of and in 2021, the office buildings. But real estate is part of the play here. What do you think? We saw the Lord and Taylor building in New York become this beautiful workspace for Amazon. But what do you think the odds are of Macy's eventually becoming a skyscraper here?"", ""Jason Moser: It reminds me a bit of the Sears thesis back in the day. Sears was really kind of going through the same process in the general thesis, therefore investors was the real estate. I think that certainly something that comes into play here may be the back of the envelope valuations. You've got Macy's real estate value anywhere from $6 billion to potentially $8 billion or more. There's an asset there that certainly could be exploited. But Macy's is a retailer. They're not a real estate company per se. It's hard to imagine how all of the real estate would be used. I'm sure it ultimately would vary by location. I'm not sure office space is the most obvious option in every case, but depending on certain locations, it absolutely could be a part of it. We are seeing slowly but surely offices haven't completely gone the way the Dodo bird yet. But there are other use cases like fulfillment and distribution. I'm talking about converting some of these types of locations into more residential use cases. Whether that schools or apartments, or condos or whatever. I think ultimately that's the attraction with such a real estate portfolio is there a lot of different ways they could go with it. I think that goes back to the fact that really when we're looking at Macy's as a company, they're not the company. This really isn't the leadership team that would be able to exploit the value in that real estate portfolio as much as say, the acquirers that are certainly more real estate-focused."", ""Deidre Woollard: Absolutely. Interesting that you brought up Sears because thinking about what they tried to do we had Seritage the spin off of all of the properties, they were going to develop that they got whacked during the pandemic. They couldn't build things fast enough to really satisfy the debt there. Now they're just basically, they're just winding down in that at they're just selling everything off. The problem with having the development be part of the thesis is you just never know what those external factors are going to be."", 'Jason Moser: Exactly.', ""Deidre Woollard: I think it's interesting you mentioned the leadership, because Macy's is right about in the midst of this leadership transition. Jeff Janette, he's been there, he's been with the company for over 20 years, I think. But he's been in the CEO seat since 2017. You've got this new CEO, Tony Spring stepping, and this has been that long transition. We've known about this one for a while. They've talked a lot about the ways that they're pivoting. Getting away from being that anchor location. They're trying out smaller stores and they've been talking on the last couple of earnings calls, they're seeing great success with this. Better sales per square foot and things like that. If this gets taken over, it sounds it's going to be a whole different strategy. It's hard to know because we won't get the earnings calls, we won't be privy to it. But it seems like it would be a strategy shift."", ""Jason Moser: I think it would have to be. Macy's was born in a different time when retailers just in a very different place. Malls aren't necessarily this massive growth opportunity that they once were. Retailers across the board focusing now more on omni channel, lighter cost structures, being able to do more with less as we as consumers just have a number of different ways we can ultimately get our stuff. There's definitely something to the brand. There's some brand equity here that matters. Ultimately is this just something where Macy's continues to exist, just in a smaller form? I think that's most likely the case. But new leadership is going to have their work on their form."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, it's interesting too because you talked about JCPenney and I've been watching the different swings they've been taking. First they thought they were going to really aim at busy suburban moms. They came up with this Athleisure line. They said that's our core customer. Now they've gone more back toward their roots and being value and trying to make that work. I think with Macy's, it's interesting because they're still primarily a department store. They've got a good online experience, but there's so much competition there. You've got the rewards membership, they've got a really good rewards program, it drives around 72% of their sales at this point. They're doing some store in store stuff with Toys R Us. It seems they're trying a lot of things. But the core question is, do we still need department stores?"", ""Jason Moser: I think that that is the core question. You make a good point there in regard to their Star Boards program is somewhere in the neighborhood, 35 or so million members give or take the day. Like you said, they drive such a majority of sales. That does matter. They do have some brand loyalty there, but the department store just doesn't carry the same weight as it once did. We talk about places like Target and Walmart that are becoming those everything stores. You've got obviously Amazon, which ultimately is the everything in store. But think about Amazon, Target, and Walmart. What's one thing all three of those concepts have in common that Macy's, to my knowledge does not, grocery. You can go get virtually anything you want, including groceries at all of these different retailers now. For something like a Macy's, you're going there with intent. You may be going there just to shop around and find something. You may not even know what it is, but you're going there with some intent. We've definitely seen concepts like Target and others benefit from the store, with a store concept Dick Sporting Goods, same thing. Opening those Ultas or those Under Armour, Nike stores within in their stores. JCPenney tried it to an extent with Sephora as well. Listen man, I think the easy solution here, Macy's links up with Trader Joe's. You open up Trader Joe's within the Macy's store, and problem solved."", ""Deidre Woollard: I like that. JCPenney tried with Sephora and they've lost that deal and now Kohl's has it. The Sephora stores have been basically holding Kohl's up at this point. They're putting Sephora anywhere they can at this point."", ""Jason Moser: Cosmetics are just a phenomenal business. We've seen it with Ulta too. Ulta has really rebounded from the challenges over the past few years. Cosmetics and beauty, just a resilient, very attractive part in the bond. A very attractive market, very difficult to disrupt."", ""Deidre Woollard: I want to talk about one more sort of acquisition that wasn't, we were following this last week. Potentially a huge mega deal between Cigna and Humana would have been this massive deal in the healthcare space went from being a rumor and then over the weekend Cigna said, we're doing a buyback of $10 billion instead. They didn't reference the deal, but definitely the message was like, hey, we have a better place to put our money. The market up Cigna has been up on the news. What killed the deal? Do you think it was the fear of the fact that it never would have gone through?"", ""Jason Moser: I have to believe that they were batting that around to me. I mean, this would have been a field day for regulators. This would have absolutely been put through the ringer. I'm not saying it couldn't have happened, but maybe the line is that it was price. The companies couldn't agree on price and so just amicably part ways and I'm sure there was something to that as well. But I think that they just ultimately maybe saw the deck stacked against them, all things considered and said, now is not the time. I will say this understanding today that they say they couldn't agree on price. I think you and I and probably everybody else under the sun knows that this would have been just field they for regulators as well. I wouldn't be shocked. Not saying this will happen, but I wouldn't be shocked to at least see this deal back on the table in some form or another, depending on the outcome of next year's election. That's just something to keep in mind. 2024 is going to be probably a crazy year on the political side. Who knows how things are going to shake out. But we do know that the current administration is keeping a very close eye on big deals like this. If the White House switches over next year, that perspective could change. If it does, then maybe you see companies feeling the landscape for consolidation is a little bit more friendly and they start to entertain deals like this. It's just something to keep in mind."", ""Deidre Woollard: It may not even need to be a shift in leadership. It may just be that the tide shifts already. We've already seen some deals that we thought wouldn't go through actually go through. So it may end up being that you don't need that shift in order for things to change."", ""Jason Moser: Maybe not. Ultimately you want deals like this to prove value. But you have be careful. There are plenty of examples out there where the big get bigger, and ultimately they get so big that it really starts to limit the options for consumers, and that's what we don't want."", ""Deidre Woollard: Cigna has talked a little bit too, or there have been stories about potential smaller acquisitions and little tuck-ins and bolt on. So you never know what could happen in terms of maybe Humana spins off something or some part of it ends up being in there. So it doesn't have to be the full thing in order for these companies to keep talking."", ""Jason Moser: Exactly. If Microsoft and Activision Blizzard figured out a way to make it work. I think anything's possible at this point."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to ask a related question about that. Thinking about stock buybacks, we want to see a stock buyback when shares are cheap. Cigna saw 10 billion, they said they're going to buy back five billion before the middle of 2024. So they put a relatively short time line on it. It's cheap now, but it's not super cheap. And certainly today it's not as cheap because it's [laughs] gone up on the news. But is this buyback a signal that they don't see anything else worth spending capital on and do you want them to buy back no matter what, even if the shares maybe aren't as cheap as they were?"", ""Jason Moser: I'm sure employees of the business could probably make a case for some of that capital being diverted to them. I think that's always something that I think is worth entertaining for these businesses, particularly as they get larger. But with that said, to your point on valuation on the shares. They're down around 10% year to date, 15 times earnings, around two times book value, seven times free cash flow. It's absolutely not an expensive-looking stock, and this is a company with a long history of repurchasing shares. Share counts down over 23%. Over the last five years alone, they've spent $22 billion on repurchases since then. So this is not their first rodeo, so to speak. So I think this is something you get with a business like this. They are looking for ways to return value to shareholders. Share repurchases are one of the ways they can do that. And at least the repurchases are having the intended effect. The share count down 23%. That's nothing to seize at."", ""Deidre Woollard: We've talked about two deals that weren't. Do you think there's going to be one or two more big deals before the year ends?"", ""Jason Moser: Honestly deal that I'm following, which is just to me a fascinating soap opera, is this entire PGA Live Tour thing. Bringing in this new consortium of sports owners who are trying to figure out their way to participate in this along with Pith and the Saudis. And they set the target for December 31st. Well that's not something that should have a big impact on public markets. It could have second-order implications on the content that we're getting and whatnot. So that's the one I'm really keeping my eye on."", ""Deidre Woollard: How awesome we'll have to talk to you after the year ends to figure out what happened next with that one."", 'Jason Moser: You got it.', 'Deidre Woollard: Thanks for the time today, Jason.', 'Jason Moser: Thank you.', ""Dylan Lewis: Hey Motley Fool Money Listeners, host Dylan Lewis here.

Matt Frankel and Ricky Mulvey they explore the potential of this conglomerate in the making.', 'Ricky Mulvey: So Matt, Boston Omaha has its arms in a number of different businesses. It can be a little bit of a difficult business to understand. Can you do the quick introduction?', ""Matt Frankel: It's an interesting company because Boston Omaha itself doesn't really do a whole lot. It's a holding company. In the sense that Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company. It doesn't really have much of its own businesses, but owns a lot of other things. So there's four main parts of Boston Omaha's business. It has its billboard rental business, which is called Link Media. It's pretty widespread in the Midwest area. If you're ever driving through Omaha itself, you'll see a bunch of link billboards. They have an insurance business called General Indemnity which sells surety bonds. They have a fiber-to-the-home broadband business, which goes under a few different brand names depending on where it's located. And they also have Boston Omaha asset management, which is a collection of other assets the company owns. It owns a minority stake in a few businesses. It owns as the name implies an asset manager, and it owns a few other little interesting investments that it bundled into one division."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's focus on the asset management business. I think that's where at least I have some confusion. It has major projects and build-to-rent housing, broadband Internet, but it also has a lot of exposure in commercial real estate. I think that may be something that investors are reacting to right now. If you look at the website, it does say it has office investments, but I have trouble finding the story beyond that. So what's the commercial real estate story for Boston Omaha right now?"", ""Matt Frankel: They owned a minority stake in an investment manager called 24th Street Asset Management and recently acquired the rest of it. They acquired the whole thing. It's included in Boston Omaha asset management. Now they had minority exposure, now they have direct exposure. 24 Street asset management operates to closed end funds today. As you mentioned, there is some office exposure. It's not a ton. Are the investments a concern? We don't really know the details. It's been a private business till now, so they don't have to report what the funds are doing to anybody. There's a lot that we don't know about it, which I think is more than the office performance itself. I think the fact that we really don't know a whole lot about their commercial real estate dealings so far, is giving investors concern."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It goes back to, what's the old saying? I'm not mad because of what you did, I'm mad because you didn't tell me."", ""Matt Frankel: Right. There's a lot of that with Boston Omaha. I'm sure we'll talk about this a little more, but they don't communicate very well with investors. They don't host earnings calls, they don't do things like that, and I think that plays a lot into the stock performance. They're trying to be very Buffetesque, which I get, [LAUGHTER] but it doesn't seem to be working."", ""Ricky Mulvey: We'll get to that. We're in a little bit of a negative place, and they don't communicate well, they have unknown commercial real estate exposure, but I know you're a Boston Omaha bull, so what's your long term thesis then for Boston Omaha?"", ""Matt Frankel: For me, the asset management business is the big potential area. I like the billboard business. The billboard business and broadband businesses especially have fantastic economics. Their broadband business. They're doing fiber to the home broadband, so it's essentially a one time capital outlay and then it's a great cash flow generator, so that business can have 90% gross margins over time. Those are three great businesses that they participate in. The asset management business is really the X factor here. They own a stake in a company called Sky Harbor. That's the biggest investment the company has made to date. But the real potential is what they're trying to do in built for rent housing and broadband, which you alluded to earlier in the sense that they're trying to raise outside capital to invest. This can be a home run source of revenue if things go correctly. It's a big if. But for example, let's say you raise $100, million from outside investors to invest in built for rent housing, you end up doubling that over a period of five years. If you agree to get, say 10 percent of any investment profits, that's a $10 million windfall that you didn't have to put up any of your own capital or assets for. Now, imagine if you're doing that over time with $1 billion of investor money, your $10 billion of investor money like some of the bigger players do. If you establish a track record in asset management, that's where the real X factor lies because it's really asset capital, and then all the other businesses can generate capital to help grow that side of the business because they do want to invest alongside all of their outside investors."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Right now the biggest revenue driver is the billboard business, but the key part with the asset management that I do give them props for is that they invest a lot of their own money alongside the folks who are in those funds.', ""Matt Frankel: That's a big part of their thesis, is that they want to benefit when their investors do well, but also to share if their investors go down, a lot of skin in the game, which we really like to see here."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Right now the company is in a little bit of an interesting spot especially as a asset management business, a collection of businesses because the price is trading below its book value, which is just the accounting value of its assets minus its liabilities. We'll get back to Boston Omaha in a sec, but why is it significant, in general, for any business, especially one like this to trade below its book value?"", ""Matt Frankel: One, book value doesn't do a great job of valuing a business like this. I mentioned Berkshire. Berkshire has said that book value is garbage right now. It used to base its buyback plan off book value, and it doesn't use that anymore, for example, but it usually underestimates the company's value. For a company like this to be trading below its book value, it's odd. Boston Omaha hasn't traded below book value as a public company, even during the initial COVID crash, it never got below its book value. I'm shaking my head a little bit on this as well. A lot of it's that the market doesn't know how to value it, a lot of it's because the market doesn't know about its office assets and things like that like you mentioned. It's a rare case because the stocks have been drawn down about 50% this year while the market's done well, so I'm shaking my head a bit."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I know you've written about this a couple of times where, what is it? There's two Wall Street analysts who follow this company, so maybe it's tough to tell what investors are discounting about it. I have to think there's something beyond just it being in the two hard pile in potentially a little bit of office real estate."", ""Matt Frankel: A lot of people do put it in the two hard pile. It's a very long term focused investment to an extreme case. A lot of companies I invest in say, Bank of America, that's definitely a long-term investment, but in the meantime, they pay me a dividend, they hold quarterly earnings calls, they make money, things like that. This is an extreme long term investment, which a lot of people don't really know how to value. I do think a lot of people put it in the two hard basket and I'm hoping they'll regret being wrong."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Right now while the market's been up, this company has taken a downturn in 2023. One move for these capital allocators. To be transparent, I own some shares in Boston Omaha, but it also has me shaking my head a bit, which is that they're issuing shares for cash right now. They're building up their cash reserve, and as the stock has gone down, they're issuing more and more shares to grow that cash pile. What's going on here? What's the capital allocation strategy that I don't understand?"", ""Matt Frankel: To be fair, I'll push back a little bit on that. They haven't issued any new shares for the past two quarters. As the bulk of the 2023 drawdown has happened, they've stopped issuing shares. I spoke to a Alex Rozek, the CEO, recently, and he specifically said that's not a desirable way to raise capital right now. Credit where it's due. I wish they would do a buyback or a tender offer or something to put investors in the other direction who feel the same way you have because you're right, in the past, say year, they've done a lot more of selling shares for cash than buying back shares without any clear use for the money because at the time they sold shares, say in the first quarter, they already had something like $50 million in the bank, which for a sub $500 million company is a lot. Why? Did they think the stock was too expensive at that point? Which is where investors heads go. I don't think that was their rationale, and they addressed this at their annual meeting a little bit, but it does make you question why they're selling shares."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Especially, what was it? A year ago, what was it? I think the leaders said this, where it was like, we have simply too many opportunities.', ""Matt Frankel: That was the whole rationale behind launching Boston Omaha asset management, like the raising outside capital. They mentioned broadband specifically. They see $500 million of opportunities to attack, and they obviously can't do that with their own capital. Instead of raising $500 million by selling shares, raising outside capital to help invest in that is more desirable."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Speaking of investor communication, you mentioned you had a conversation with Co-CEO Alex Rozek, what did you learn?', ""Matt Frankel: Apparently instead of having earnings calls, they just talk to me for an hour or so. No, all jokes aside, I love that they're very approachable CEO's, even at their annual meeting. It's not like the Berkshire annual meeting. Anyone can walk up to the CEO's, and just have a conversation. It's very open communication in that sense. But like you said, the company does not host earnings calls. They generally don't talk to analysts, maybe me, but they really don't talk to analysts. They don't give commentary in their earnings reports. They issue quarterly earnings reports, but there's no like management quotes that are usually at the top of earnings reports. Alex even acknowledged to me that they need to do a better job of communication, but he doesn't really know what that should look like. How do you increase communication while still saying, don't worry about the quarterly numbers and things like that as much? It is a balancing act, but he agrees the market really doesn't know how to value the stock. Just to give you a fun example, I mentioned they own a lot of Sky Harbor. Sky Harbor makes up almost 30% of Boston, Omaha's market cap right now. There was a three day period a couple of weeks ago where Sky Harbor went up 40% and Boston Omaha stock didn't budge. It should have been up like 15% in that time because if Apple went up by 20 to 30%, Berkshire Hathaway stock would probably go up too because it own so much of it. It's just a head scratcher in a lot of ways because the market really doesn't seem to know what to do here."", 'Ricky Mulvey: To backtrack just a sec. Sky Harbor, they own private hangers for private jets going in and out at different airports.', ""Matt Frankel: Sky Harbor, to my knowledge, I don't know if you know any Ricky, but out of the big SPACs boom, I don't know any SPACs that are trading for more than their $10 initial price other than Sky Harbor. That's one of their few success stories."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I'd have to start Googling and that's terrible podcasting. I think I want to leave it with this question. Boston Omaha, really? I would say there is a welcome comparison to Berkshire Hathaway. They got Omaha in the name. There's the familial connection with Warren Buffett, but I don't know, do you think it's earned that swagger to not host quarterly earnings calls, not talk to analysts? Why not pre-announce your earnings date and make it a little bit easier for the investors trying to follow your company?"", ""Matt Frankel: I would have to say no, they have not earned that type of swagger yet. With Berkshire it certainly makes sense. Buffett's mentality is, I've doubled the annualized returns of the S&P for over 50 years, shut up and trust the process. He's earned the right to say that. But even when the sky is falling, Buffett's out on CNBC, calming investors down. I feel you need to earn some track record to get to that point. It sounds like Alex agrees somewhat, he just doesn't really know what communication look at this point, and it feel like they're trying to be a little too Buffetesque at times."", ""Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I'm Deidre Woollard. Thanks for listening. We'll see you tomorrow."", 'Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average, also known as Dow Jones or Dow, is one of the oldest and most followed equity indexes of the United States stock market. It was founded more than a century ago in 1896 by Charles Dow, the editor of the Wall Street Journal at the time. Originally, the Dow comprised just twelve companies that were commodity-focused. In 1928, the index was expanded to 30 stocks. It is a price-weighted index, unlike other market indexes which weigh businesses on their market capitalizations of businesses.\xa0', 'In a stock market filled with uncertainty, investments in the Dow are great for stability and defense. However, in a bull market, the Dow cannot always compete with the growth of other indexes that are more tech heavy. For example, so far this year, the market has responded positively to steady interest rates and slowing inflation. The benchmark S&P 500 has returned more than 24% to investors year-to-date. The NASDAQ Composite has outplaced even the S&P 500, returning over 44% to investors. The Dow has returned around 13%.\xa0', 'However, these numbers do not tell the whole story. The Dow has actually shined for value investors over the long term, unlike the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. For example, despite stellar returns in 2023, the S&P 500 is still slightly off the peak it achieved in early 2022. The NASDAQ is actually down by 5%. The Dow sits handsomely above both these indexes with returns of around 3% during this time span. Stocks on the Dow often lag behind the overall market during bull periods but are resilient against sell-offs during recessions.\xa0', 'Some of the top Dow stocks to buy now include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). These firms have established product lines and steady revenues, a quality that all Dow stocks are famous for. Andrew Witty, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), recently highlighted during the third quarter earnings call that the firm was focused on delivering well-balanced and durable growth for investors.\xa0', ""“As a direct result of mission-driven focus, this year, we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022. By the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at Optum Health, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on Optum Rx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third-quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year."", 'The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models. This year, we expect Optum Health will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources and until now, often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need.”', 'Our Methodology', 'These were picked from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and ranked by hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

If you can buy a quality stock at a relatively low price, though, so much the better."", 'Here are three high-quality, low-cost value stocks, meeting that description, that you could buy sizable stakes in now and hold on to for years.', ""While U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) is one of the 10 largest financial institutions in the country, it is smaller than the likes of JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America, and doesn't do as much business in certain areas the banking giants are best known for. For instance, corporate fundraising, institutional trading, and wealth management aren't major profit centers for U.S. Bank. This limits its revenue and earnings growth prospects, particularly when the economy is firing on all cylinders."", ""Yet in many ways, a simpler suite of product and service offerings is advantageous to U.S. Bancorp's investors. Primary among that -- the bank can better focus on doing the things it does (like consumer lending) well. And its results are more predictable because they're less cyclical."", ""That's what the graph below shows us. While the subprime mortgage meltdown and the COVID-19 pandemic clearly undermined its top and bottom lines, it's also clear that U.S. Bancorp quickly recovered from both and got back on its long-standing growth track. Not every bigger banking outfit can say the same."", ""Boring? A little. But that's the point -- if you're going to be sitting on a stock for many years, you want to be able to count on the underlying company's progress. U.S. Bancorp reliably logs it, even if never at tremendous speed. And shareholders collect decent dividends all the while. Its yield of 4.4% at the current share price is better than average."", ""Newcomers will be stepping into U.S. Bank's stock at 13.1 times earnings, and only 10.4 times its forward earnings."", ""Shares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) may not be as cheap as U.S. Bancorp's are -- the drugmaker's price-to-earnings ratio stands at 15.5, while its forward price-to-earnings ratio is a little under 12. Still, those valuations are cheap, and certainly below average pharmaceutical stock valuations right now."", ""There's no sense in ignoring the 800-pound gorilla in the room here: Governments are effectively winding down their intense efforts to combat COVID-19. Although new variants continue to surface, and a seasonal surge in new cases is underway, demand for vaccines and treatments is waning. Pfizer's third-quarter revenue fell 42% year over year, with slumping sales of the company's COVID products responsible for the entirety of that dip. Don't be surprised to see this weakness linger at least a little while longer."", ""Just don't tarry too long if you're considering eventually opening a new position in Pfizer stock. The current quarter should be the last one to show a major year-over-year sales tumble due to people's fading concerns about the virus. Beginning in early 2024, Pfizer's business results will largely reflect demand for everything else in its portfolio and pipeline."", ""And that's exciting, to be sure."", ""Among other things, Pfizer owns blood thinner Eliquis, cardiomyopathy treatment Vyndaqel, pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, and cancer-fighting Ibrance, to name just a few. These are all blockbuster drugs, but they haven't realized their full potential yet because of the pandemic. Never even mind its pipeline, where you'll find sickle cell disease treatment Oxbryta, multiple myeloma therapy Elranatamab, and hemophilia drug Marstacimab. All told, Pfizer believes its current pipeline could be producing $20 billion worth of annual revenue by 2030, contributing to up to $84 billion worth of annual companywide sales that year thanks to its recent acquisition of Seagen. From here, the company will put its focus back on these longer-lived opportunities."", 'The kicker: There are credible plans to simultaneously begin culling at least $4 billion worth of annual costs.', ""There's not a lot not to like here if you're truly looking a few years down the road."", 'Last but not least, add Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) to your list of value stocks to buy now and hold for years.', ""It's not exactly a household name. In fact, there's a decent chance you've never even heard of the company, which also goes by TSMC. There's also a strong chance, however, that you're using technology manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor right now without even realizing it."", ""Although tech giants like Intel and Nvidia are starting to handle more of their own manufacturing, the bulk of this work is still farmed out to third parties capable of cranking out silicon designed by more familiar players. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company isn't just one of these contract manufacturers. It's the world's biggest, with more than half of the third-party semiconductor fabrication market."", 'The company was hit as hard as any other by the COVID-19 pandemic, which not only crimped demand, but banged up supply chains as well (coming and going). The turbulence is still bumping the business around, too. Analysts believe Taiwan Semiconductor is on pace to fall nearly 9% for the full year.', 'The supply headaches of the pandemic have also inspired several big tech names to become more self-sufficient. Intel is investing billions of dollars to build two different chip foundries in the United States, for example, while Micron has budgeted up to $100 billion to build what it refers to as a ""megafab"" in central New York.', ""Yet, despite these initiatives, the world still needs third-party chip foundries. This is going to remain the case for a long while, too, if not forever. In fact, Taiwan Semiconductor is so certain its advanced capabilities and services will remain in demand for the foreseeable future that it's building its own production facility in Arizona. And, given the 19.5% revenue growth expected of the company in the coming year, that's arguably the right call. It's a sign that the chip business is recovering, and bringing Taiwan Semiconductor along for the ride."", ""Trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6, TSMC isn't exactly a screaming value. However, it's below this ticker's recent average earnings ratio, and below the valuations many of its peers are sporting right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them.

Last year, it made a third of its sales with its lung cancer treatment Tagrisso under the spotlight.\xa0AstraZeneca also holds key drugs in cardiovascular health and immunology, but even “rare disease” drugs made almost 16% of its top line last year. These so-called orphan drugs are margin-boosting specialty products due to their higher prices and exclusivity, so it is only natural that AstraZeneca continues to go deeper into this area, which also includes its purchase of rare-disease therapies from Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE).\xa0Back in September, AstraZeneca completed the purchase and license agreement for early-stage rare-disease gene therapy portfolio from\xa0Pfizer\xa0for a total consideration of $1 billion. Also, several of the Pfizer employees associated with the portfolio joined Alexion as employees. With the tools gained from Pfizer, these new resources will build on the combined capabilities of Alexion and AstraZeneca in genomic medicine.', 'Earlier this month, Pfizer received approval for its $43 billion acquisition of cancer drug maker Seagen. Along with the acquisition, Pfizer also revealed its plans to create a new oncology division early next year. Back in August, Pfizer also received the approval from US FDA for its blood cancer therapy. With Elrexfio, Pfizer\xa0targeted\xa0multiple myeloma, a\xa0cancer that is very difficult to treat.', 'The experimental vaccine that Moderna and Merck developed is to be used with Merck’s blockbuster treatment Keytruda. Although earlier clinical trial results were encouraging, latest data from December showed the combined treatment is even more effective than initially thought. When the cancer vaccine from Moderna and Merck is combined with Keytruda, midstage trial data revealed it\xa0reduced the risk of deadly skin cancer\xa0melanoma\xa0returning after three years by 49%\xa0compared to those who received Keytruda alone after three years. This treatment duo also\xa0reduced the risk of melanoma spreading to other parts of the body by as much as 62% over the same time frame.', 'The latest\xa0results build on midstage trial data Moderna and Merck released earlier this year, which examined the efficacy of the combination over a shorter period.\xa0Earlier trial results showed that\xa0after two years, the vaccine and Keytruda\xa0lowered the risk of a lethal outcome and relapse by 44% while also lowering the\xa0risk of the cancer\xa0spreading in the body by 65%.\xa0Moderna and Merck are also testing their protocol for treating other cancer types, including non-small lung cancer.', 'But pharma has also advanced on the field of cancer prevention and early detection. For example, Mainz Biomed (NASDAQ: MYNZ), a\xa0molecular genetics diagnostic company that specializes in the early detection of cancer,\xa0reported optimistic results for its flagship product, colorectal cancer screening test, ColoAlert® this year. With its U.S. eAArly DETECT multi-center study, Mainz Biomed reported the test’s sensitivity for colorectal cancer as high as 97% with specificity of 97%. Also, by integrating novel mRNA biomarkers, Mainz Biomed achieved an 82% sensitivity for advanced adenoma, which is a known precursor to CRC.\xa0These\xa0positive results from ColoFuture confirmed the positive results that Mainz Biomed released from its European study earlier in October.\xa0Mainz Biomed already commercialized its\xa0efficacious and easy-to-use CRC screening test across Europe and in select international territories.', 'This year may not go down in pharma history, but it is the year when AstraZeneca, Mainz Biomed, Pfizer, Moderna and Merck clearly set their intention to redefine cancer treatment.', 'DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The diversification of product portfolios of alcohol companies has been helping boost their top lines. Companies are expected to benefit from the momentum in spirits and ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails. Investments in product innovations, premiumization and technology platforms bode well for players like AnheuserBusch InBev BUD, Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, Brown-Forman (BF.B), Molson Coors TAP and The Boston Beer Company SAM.However, companies in the alcohol space have been witnessing higher commodity and logistics costs due to escalated input and packaging costs. The industry participants have been keen on spending on advertising and marketing, which has resulted in higher operational costs. These elevated costs are likely to persist and may hurt the margins of alcohol makers.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry mainly comprises producers, importers, exporters, marketers and sellers of alcoholic beverages like beer, craft beer, ciders, wine, rum, whiskey, liqueurs, vodka, tequila, champagnes, brandy, amaretto, RTD cocktails and malt. Some industry players also produce and sell non-alcoholic beverages like carbonated soft drinks, sparkling waters, bottled water, energy drinks, powdered and natural juices and RTD teas. The companies sell products through wholesalers and retailers like supermarkets, warehouse clubs, grocery stores, convenience stores, package stores, drug stores and other retail outlets. The industry participants also sell beer directly to consumers in cans and bottles at restaurants, pubs, bars and liquor stores. Some brewers operate brewpubs or taste rooms at breweries, offering consumers the freshest beer.', ""What's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Alcohol Industry?"", 'Premiumization & Product Diversification: Premiumization has been a key growth driver for players in the alcohol space due to consumers’ continued desires for refreshing and newer tastes. Many beverage companies are diversifying their product offerings to capture more sales. Alcohol companies have also been witnessing robust demand trends for premium and high-end products. From the rise of craft spirits to the increasing demand for low-alcohol and non-alcoholic options, the landscape of the alcoholic beverage market is undergoing a notable transformation. As a result, players have been exploring opportunities beyond the traditional beer, whiskey, spirits and wine categories. Some popular variations that have gained traction include RTD spirits like canned wine and cocktails, hard seltzers, cider and flavored malt beverages. To capitalize on the priority and consumer trends, companies have been resorting to innovative products. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing alcohol segment. Many companies in the industry have collaborated to grow their shares in the fast-growing RTD category.E-Commerce Development & Pricing Gains: Alcohol companies have been benefiting from the rise of e-commerce and the recovery across markets and channels, boosting volume. Investments in online and e-commerce portals have gained prominence. Companies have been investing in the latest capabilities and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers. With a recovery in markets and channels and the expansion of digital capabilities, players in the alcohol space look well-poised for growth. Additionally, companies have been benefiting from price increases and supply productivity savings, offsetting the effects of cost inflation. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting sales of alcohol companies.Elevated Costs: Players in the alcohol industry have been enduring pressures from the ongoing impacts of inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. The industry players have been experiencing elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees and secondary packaging materials, leading to increased costs of sales and higher operating costs. These have been resulting in adverse gross and operating margins for beverage companies.Apart from elevated input and packaging costs, players in the alcohol industry are anticipated to witness higher advertising and promotional expenses and SG&A costs, further threatening profitability. Rising brand investments, particularly in media, advertising, production and local marketing, and increased freight to distributors due to higher volumes are resulting in elevated advertising, promotional and selling expenses. Growing external costs, increased compensation expenses and higher discretionary spending are expected to drive SG&A deleverage. Most industry players expect the trend to continue in the near term, impacting profitability to some extent.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry is a 19-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

Yet, amid this resurgence, the sector grappled with challenges, witnessing a slowdown in electric vehicle (EV) development and setbacks in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology.', ""Amid these industry-wide currents, one story took center stage and captured the collective attention — the United Auto Workers' (UAW) landmark strike against the Detroit 3 automakers. A year ago, not many knew who Shawn Fain was. But six months into his UAW presidency, Fain made a resounding impact. Upon assuming office, he called on his constituents to brace themselves for a war against the automakers."", 'True to his unwavering commitment, Fain embarked on a mission to secure equitable wages and benefits for UAW workers, setting the stage for intense contract negotiations. This ultimately resulted in a six-week strike against the Detroit 3 automakers.', ""As we bid farewell to 2023, let's delve into the top auto stories and trends that made waves this year."", 'The UAW initiated an unprecedented simultaneous strike against Detroit 3 automakers —\xa0General Motors\xa0GM,\xa0Ford\xa0F\xa0and\xa0Stellantis\xa0STLA — after the contract expired on Sep 14 at midnight. For the first time in its more than 80-year history, the UAW concurrently called a strike on GM, F and STLA. Central to this dispute was the wide gap between union demands and automaker offers. The UAW called for a 36% increase in hourly wages and a reduced workweek, along with other demands.', 'After extensive negotiations and a six-week strike, the UAW reached record agreements with Detroit 3 automakers. The new labor agreements until 2028 featured a 25% boost in base wages, including an immediate 11% rise. This cumulative increase will elevate the top wage by 33%, incorporating estimated cost-of-living adjustments, reaching over $42 per hour. Additionally, the agreements will eliminate wage tiers in factories and streamline the progression to earn the top wage from eight years to three years.', ""Labor negotiations and production interruptions resulted in a substantial financial impact on the Big 3 automakers, amounting to approximately $3.6 billion. GM estimated an EBIT-adjusted loss of $1.1 billion, while Ford anticipated strike-related lost profits of $1.7 billion ($1.6 billion of which pertained to the fourth quarter). STLA's CFO, Paul Jacobson, projected that the strike would impact the company with an approximate pre-tax earnings reduction of around $800 million."", 'Following the UAW record-setting deals with the Detroit Three automakers, auto giants with production facilities in the United States responded by raising wages for their non-unionized workforce. Companies, including Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Hyundai and other nonunion automakers, swiftly implemented substantial salary increases for their manufacturing employees.', 'The efficacy of these wage hikes in deterring unionization efforts will unfold in 2024 and beyond. Fain, attributing these raises to the ""UAW bump,"" initiated a campaign to organize 13 automakers (BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Lucid, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Rivian, Subaru, Tesla, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo). This strategic move aims to capitalize on the momentum gained in Detroit, seeking to bolster the union\'s influence and power, reversing decades of declining membership. If successful, the union would nearly double its representation, as the 13 companies collectively employ around 150,000 U.S. manufacturing workers, compared to the UAW\'s current membership of approximately 146,000 members at the Detroit 3.', ""The EV charging landscape underwent a seismic shift, with a major move toward the adoption of\xa0Tesla's TSLA North American Charging Standard (NACS) port.It was Ford that got the ball rolling. In May, Ford announced that it would make its charging cords compatible with Tesla's NACS cables, granting Ford EV owners access to Tesla's vast Supercharger network. General Motors followed suit with a similar announcement in June. Subsequently, a wave of major automakers, including Rivian, Toyota, Honda, and others, embraced Tesla's NACS port, signaling a broad industry transition."", ""In response to the industry-wide evolution,\xa0leading charging equipment manufacturers\xa0Blink Charging, ChargePoint,\xa0EVgo\xa0and\xa0Wallbox announced plans to offer chargers featuring Tesla's connector, marking a significant turn away from the standard Combined Charging System connector. This shift positions Tesla to potentially generate billions of dollars by opening up access to its Supercharger network."", 'Despite a rise in EV market share to 7.4% of the U.S. market through the third quarter of 2023, the pace of adoption has not matched initial expectations. A letter from nearly 4,000 dealerships to President Joe Biden emphasized concerns about federal EV mandates. Dealerships are of the view that customer apprehensions about range, reliability and pricing are resulting in lower-than-expected EV sales. Tesla, though still dominant, saw its market share decrease from almost two-thirds to 57.4% despite multiple rounds of price cuts, indicating increased competition.', 'While significant investments were announced by automakers in EV production last year, 2023 witnessed obstacles in the EV boom, prompting manufacturers to exercise caution and reconsider some of those massive investments. In December, Ford revealed plans to slash production of its Lightning Pro model by 50%, reducing the weekly output at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, MI, from 3,200 trucks to 1,600.', ""Additionally, GM faced a setback in its EV strategy, announcing a significant nine-month delay in the launch of EV drive production at the Toledo Propulsion Systems plant. Originally scheduled for early 2024, production is now rescheduled for the end of 2024, following GM's October announcement of postponing the production of electric trucks, including the Chevy Silverado RST and GMC Sierra Denali EVs, to late 2025."", ""In 2023, autonomous vehicles encountered significant challenges, exemplified by GM's self-driving unit — Cruise. Following a San Francisco accident where a Cruise car injured a pedestrian, the company's permits to operate autonomous vehicles in California were suspended. This incident forced Cruise to retract its ambitious expansion plans, leading to CEO Kyle Vogt's resignation, the dismissal of nine leaders and a 24% employee layoff. With only nine months of cash left and losses exceeding $8 billion since 2017, Cruise's future appears uncertain, compounded by the reluctance of major investor Honda to inject more funds."", 'Tesla, a pioneer in autonomous technology, grappled with its issues in 2023. The company initiated the recall of 2 million vehicles, limiting the use of its Autopilot driver-assistance software. (Tesla Recalls 2M Vehicles to Fix Autopilot Features)', 'These setbacks underscore the elusive nature of the promise of full self-driving autonomy on public roads, pushing the industry further away from achieving this ambitious goal.', 'Apart from price caps, EV tax credits prioritize companies obtaining battery minerals from the United States or its trade allies and producing battery components in North America. Per the U.S. Treasury list in April, specific EV models of GM, F, TSLA and STLA qualified for the $7,500 tax credits in 2023. The credit is divided into two parts, with the first $3,750 related to sourcing of battery minerals, increasing from 40% to 80% by 2027. The other half involves U.S. assembly, escalating from 50% in 2023 to 70% in 2026.', ""Federal incentives have led automakers to rush to establish compliant supply chains. However, following guidance from the Biden administration restricting the use of China-made battery components, many EVs are now ineligible for the tax credit, impacting car manufacturers' ability to meet these stringent requirements. Many GM, F and TSLA models will be losing EV tax credit\xa0eligibility beginning Jan 1, 2024. Tesla's most affordable Model 3 is anticipated to lose its $7,500 tax credit starting Jan 1, as stricter sourcing rules come into effect."", ""This used car e-retailer made it to the top stories of 2022 with a drastic decline of 98% in its share price amid growing concerns about the company going out of business. In 2023, Carvana catapulted back into the spotlight, emerging as the year's auto stock champion.

The e-pickup will be offered in three different configurations — Single Motor RWD with 250+ miles of range and a startup speed of 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, Dual Motor AWD with 300+ miles of range and a startup speed of 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds, and Tri Motor AWD with 500+ miles of range and a startup speed of 0-60 mph in 2.9 seconds.

If you want to read about some more stocks to buy as interest rates remain high, go directly to 5 Biggest Stocks That Benefit From High Interest Rates.\xa0', 'The central bank in the United States has indicated that it will begin a massive change in monetary policy heading into the next year as inflation numbers cool and confidence grows about a soft landing for the economy. In the final meeting of the year, the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged for the third straight month, with officials even signaling that rate cuts might be on the horizon in 2024. Fed chief Jerome Powell pointed to strong growth numbers, a comeback in the labor market, and progress on inflation as some of the reasons for optimism.\xa0', 'News platform Fox Business reports that Federal Open Market Committee officials expect rates to fall to 4.6% by the end of 2024. This forecast envisions at least three rate cuts next year, each a quarter point. This policy will continue into 2025 and 2026. Even though some experts predict that the Fed may start cutting rates as early as March next year, others have more moderate expectations. For example, Kathy Bostjancic, the chief economist at financial services firm Nationwide, expects rate cuts to begin by May.\xa0', 'Higher interest rates are good for companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), who benefit from higher earnings on consumer and business loans, effectively increasing their revenues overnight. In a higher interest rates environment, rates rise across the board, from mortgages, to credit card debt, to auto loans. Over the past year-and-a-half, interest rates have climbed at a pace not seen in nearly fifty years.\xa0', 'However, investors should keep in mind that this is a gradual process. Even though inflation numbers are cooling, the prices of consumer items remain 3% above what they were last year. The prices of basic necessities like food, healthcare, and rent have all gone up in the past year and show no signs of slowing down. It will likely be a few months before the rate cuts promised by the Federal Reserve are announced. It will then take at least two years or more for the economy to fully stabilize following these cuts.\xa0\xa0', 'In this overall situation, even as rate cuts begin, investments in companies that benefit from rising interest rates are expected to return handsome profits. This is because these companies have diverse revenue streams and long-term plans in place for growth that shield them from macroeconomic volatility. One example of this is Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), whose CEO Jane Fraser, said during the third quarter earnings call that the firm was a bank for all seasons because of ample liquidity and a diversified earnings base for clients.\xa0', '“In terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past 5 years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection. Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% and which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100 bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buyback quarter by quarter, and I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board.”', 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that benefit when interest rates are high and have received positive analyst coverage were selected for the list.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Utility Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media.\xa0', 'The utility sector has been in the limelight on Wall Street as the energy transition away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy sources dominates new spending in the sector. Even though utilities have historically been shielded from pricing pressures, the conditions created by surging energy costs, geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, and supply chain issues have all impacted the industry. Clean energy remains the key theme, however, with estimates suggesting clean power will generate over 33% of all US power within the next two years.\xa0', 'Some of the key firms to monitor in this context include Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED), and American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP). These firms are spending billions in an effort to move towards wind, nuclear, solar, and other clean sources of energy creation. By the end of this decade, corporate demand for clean energy is likely to add more than 94 GW of renewable energy capacity to the electricity grid in the United States.\xa0', 'In this exciting era of change, utility stocks offer investors a mix of growth and value. Traditionally, utility firms are value kings with reliable dividend payouts and steady share prices. However, the pivot away from fossil fuels adds a factor of growth to these firms that had been missing before. This has also led to activist investor interest in the sector. Even the US government is exploring options to put money into the utilities business that has suffered from historic underinvestment.\xa0', 'Lynn Good, the CEO of Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), recently underlined during the third quarter earnings call that her company was investing in modernizing the electrical grid to protect it against hazardous weather conditions. She also noted how annual rate updates were important to efficiently recover investments. Good identified renewables, battery storage, natural gas, and energy efficiency and demand side management as some of the resources Duke was using to meet the evolving power needs of customers.\xa0', ""“Our response to Hurricane Idalia in September, yet again demonstrated the value of our grid-hardening investments. The storm caused over 200,000 outages, and we restored power to 95% of customers within 36 hours. Further, our investment in self-healing grid technologies saved more than 7 million outage minutes for customers. Shifting to the Midwest, in October, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved the new rates in our electric rate case, which utilized a forecasted test year. And the commission approved a 9.75% ROE, a 50 basis point increase from the previous case as well as increasing the equity component of the capital structure to 52%. Across our footprint, we've built considerable momentum over the last year, and our long-term organic growth strategy has never been more clear."", ""This past year has made our company stronger and more agile as we've responded to macroeconomic headwinds. I'm confident we're well positioned to deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% earnings growth over the next five years.”"", 'Our Methodology', 'To select stocks for this list, we scoured the top stock picks in the utility world as recommended by prominent financial websites. The websites consulted for this purpose include Forbes, The Motley Fool, Business Insider, Morningstar, Kiplinger, The Street, and Investopedia. Only articles from 2023 were considered. The top twelve consensus picks were then selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices.

If you're looking for top growth stocks to buy right now, here are two names that have what it takes to continue rewarding investors in 2024 and beyond."", ""Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ: ISRG) da Vinci surgical robotics systems have been used in more than 13 million procedures since its first suite was approved over 20 years ago. The pandemic, a difficult macro environment, and financial challenges facing its hospital clients have all had an impact on growth. But this is still a highly profitable, revenue-producing business that controls a notable share of the surgical robotics space."", 'According to Grand View Research, the global surgical robotics market is on track to hit a valuation of $7.4 billion by the year 2030. This is a space that was valued at about $4 billion in 2023, giving this industry an anticipated compound annual growth rate of about 10% in the forecast period.', ""To give you an idea of Intuitive Surgical's considerable footprint in this space, consider that it generated $1.7 billion in robotics system sales in 2022 alone. It also generated $3.5 billion from sales of accompanying instruments and accessories, along with around $1 billion in revenue from related services it sold to customers in the 12-month period. In short, 79% of the company's revenue in the full year was from recurring revenue sources."", ""Moreover, Intuitive Surgical's installed base of systems soared 11% between 2019 and 2022, while the procedures performed globally using its products jumped 15% in that three-year period. In 2022 alone, Intuitive Surgical's procedure growth exploded 18% from the prior year."", 'The S&P 500 is up about 25% over the trailing 12 months, and Intuitive Surgical has delivered a steady return of just shy of 30% in that same period. The business has also expanded its top line by 67% over the last five years alone, while net income has risen by 17% in that same period. Not bad for a healthcare stock in a mature stage of its business growth story.', 'The surgical robotics space is expected to continue growing as adoption of these tools increases among healthcare providers globally. So long-term investors may want to scoop up a slice of this company before 2024 is underway.', ""Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is a household name that needs no introduction. But you might be surprised at just how reliable a business this well-known brick-and-mortar retailer has proven to be through the years. It's no secret that retailers across a range of industry segments, including big-box stores, have struggled in a macro environment where spending among wallet-constrained consumers remains heavily in flux."", ""Let's take a look at a few interesting figures. Over the trailing-five-year period, Costco's annual revenue has grown by a total of 60%, while its net income has risen by 72% in that same stretch of time. Meanwhile, cash from operations has soared to the tune of 74% in that five-year window. Oh, and there's Costco's dividend, which while yielding a modest 0.6%, has risen 2,500% in the last five years to help drive a total return of 242% in that time frame."", ""Some of the keys to Costco's continued success are its membership-fee based model and its low-cost bulk products. Both are integral to Costco's business, and are also interrelated. Because most shoppers need to be members to enter a store warehouse, this means that 1) if a shopper is in store they are likely there to make a purchase, thereby weeding out simple foot traffic, and 2) Costco generates consistent, recurring revenue from membership dues."", ""In fact, most of Costco's net income is entirely attributable to the money it makes from membership fees. And those membership fees are one of the key reasons Costco is able to offer such competitive prices on its products. For the end consumer, the ability to access the wide range of Costco's products and services at below-average costs is a sticky buying proposition in any economic environment, and even more so in a murky one."", ""Costco does operate a growing e-commerce segment that non-members can use. But the considerable price differences between some products found online versus in-store continue to drive buyers to its flagship warehouse locations. Case in point: Membership renewal rates are 93% in the U.S. and Canada, where Costco operates most of its locations. In short, if you're looking for a steadily growing and profitable business that serves a consistent consumer need and offers dividends to boot, Costco is a no-brainer buy to add to your basket as you kick off the new year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intuitive Surgical wasn't one of them.

But the tech trade is not the only industry that has benefitted this past year.', 'Yahoo Finance Live examines several other outperformers across industries, including cruise operators Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Carnival Corp. (CCL), and even retail chain Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF). Solar energy stocks disappointed in 2023 as significant players saw big annual losses.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '- Tesla, NVIDIA, and Apple among the best performers in our top trending tickers of the year. All of these names having a lot of excitement on the AI play, also part of the Magnificent Seven when you look at an NVIDIA and an Apple.', ""Interesting too. I've been seeing some charts comparing Tesla's performance to Bitcoin. And they fall in very similar highs and lows throughout the year. So maybe a similar investing profile there."", 'But not surprising to see these names doing well in a year where we were looking for some safe haven trades in these big tech names that were powered by the AI boom.', '- Yeah, so Tesla and Apple having their best years since 2020. Interesting because as Steve Sosnick mentioned to us a little while ago. Revenue was declining for Apple. And yet the stock still managed to gain. NVIDIA not surprisingly, best year ever in terms of its performance, powering it to a new record.', 'What I find interesting about these three names as well is that they are all well-known. NVIDIA has become a well-known consumer name, even though it is not a directly consumer facing product obviously. But it goes into a lot of products that consumers use.', ""So it's interesting, the intersection between them being of most interest to Yahoo Finance users, them being top performers. And hopefully for people, they were long these names. And they ended up having a good year."", ""- Hopefully, they were happy. I mean, I'm really interested to see how the Tesla double clickers on our platform feel heading into next year. We know that UBS is anticipating that electric vehicle sales were about 47% this year and growth. That's going to go down to 11% growth next year."", ""That's not necessarily a good leading indicator if you're long on a name like Tesla. But maybe the AI boom, maybe if they can mention that enough times on an earnings call. That'll help them."", ""- Well, and also Elon Musk has tried to manage expectations around that as well and tried to set the bar kind of low going into next year. Let's also take a look at some of the other stocks that we've been watching closely this year."", 'Cruise stock sort of a surprise here at the top of the S&P 500 along with these large cap tech stocks. Royal Caribbean, the third best performer in the S&P 500. Carnival coming in at number 6 here.', ""So it's been very interesting to see these cruise stocks really perform well and finished the year strong, as well as we got the so-called revenge travel boom. And we just recently spoke to Josh Weinstein, who's the CEO at Carnival. And he talked about the visibility that they have into 2024 is remarkable."", 'The bookings. The strength in bookings that they are seeing at this point in the year he says is basically the best that it has ever been at this point looking out into next year. And so investors really paying attention to that.', ""Debt is still an issue for some of these cruise line operators. But they're working to address it. That's something also that investors have been happy about."", ""- It's another one of those surprising names because I keep waiting to see evidence of this shift away from services over to goods. So you see a Royal Caribbean performing well in the stock market, you see a Nike down. I'm not seeing the big shift from service spending to goods spending in that exact comparison dynamic."", ""So I wonder whether or not that prediction is going to play out is inflation making consumers maybe think, OK, a cruise, you can get a little bit more bang for your buck in that type of travel.

I do want to talk about Abercrombie & Fitch. Not to really pull away from Brian Sozzi here by talking about this name. I know he loves to talk about it.', 'But this name is up 300%. If you look at the S&P 1500 index. So a little bit of a stretch there. But outperforming NVIDIA, if you look at their 260% year to date returns, Julie.', 'So I just found that really interesting. This is one of those names where the CEO Fran Horowitz has been able to really rebrand the company. Having obviously a lot of public relations challenges over the years. Expanding also into things like athleisure, workwear, event wear, and that kind of product diversification has been rewarded by the street and by consumer sales.', ""- Something I found so fascinating about Abercrombie is it's sort of grown with its customer base. I think of Abercrombie or I thought of Abercrombie as largely a teen brand. But I know many of the 20 and 30 somethings at the office who love it going back to our anecdata, right?"", '- Yeah.', ""- So I think that's kind of a fun thing about Abercrombie.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Regions Financial (NYSE:RF). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' See our latest analysis for Regions Financial ', 'If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Recognition must be given to the that Regions Financial has grown EPS by 45% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.', ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Our analysis has highlighted that Regions Financial's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. While we note Regions Financial achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 10% to US$7.3b. That's encouraging news for the company!"", ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart."", ""In investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Regions Financial's forecast profits?"", ""Owing to the size of Regions Financial, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. To be specific, they have US$50m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. While their ownership only accounts for 0.3%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders."", ""Regions Financial's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Regions Financial for a spot on your watchlist. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Regions Financial   you should know about."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

If Visa (NYSE: V) reached this threshold, it would be a big deal. However, with Visa worth about $535 billion now, it would have to nearly double to join this exclusive club.', ""But could Visa do this by 2030? Let's find out."", ""Visa is a company nearly anyone in the U.S. would recognize. Many consumers carry its credit or debit cards, but Visa doesn't manage the debt or bank accounts behind them. Instead, Visa processes the transactions every time a card is used. This business model is similar to competitor Mastercard's business but different from American Express, which holds consumers' debt on its balance sheet."", ""Visa's toll-booth business model, which takes a small fee each time its network is used, is one of the best out there. Once the network is set up, it requires little additional cost to operate, allowing the company to post top-notch profit margins. Visa's business exemplifies this, as its margin profile is among the widest of any company."", ""With Visa turning more than half of every dollar it takes into pure profit, it's one of the most efficient businesses around. This also allows Visa to produce a lot of cash, which it uses to pay a dividend and repurchase shares."", 'Visa pays only a modest dividend, with the company recently raising its payout to $0.52 per quarter. That works out to about a 0.8% yield, far from a best-in-class dividend. However, this 0.8% yield is better than nothing and adds to its long-term return potential.', 'Visa mostly uses its cash to repurchase shares. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Visa spent $12.1 billion on repurchases versus $3.75 billion on dividends. This has been a long-term strategy for Visa, as it has drastically reduced its share count during the past decade.', 'Time Frame', 'Shares Outstanding Reduction', '1 year', '(2.4%)', '5 year', '(7.8%)', '10 year', '(18.4%)', 'Data source: YCharts.', ""This plan will continue for Visa, as the board just authorized a new, multiyear $25 billion repurchase program. Both dividends and repurchases help boost Visa's long-term return potential, but is it enough for the company to cross the $1 trillion threshold?"", ""From today's prices, Visa's stock would have to rise almost 90% or have a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 9.8%. Over long periods, stock price rises are highly correlated to earnings growth. So, assuming Visa needs to increase its earnings by essentially 10% each year is reasonable. The dividend provides about a 0.8% yield, which knocks the required return down to 9%."", ""If Visa can also repurchase about 2.4% of it shares (as it did in 2023), that will provide an automatic 2.46% earnings boost, even if net income doesn't increase that year. That would reduce the required earnings growth to about 6.5%."", ""In FY 2023, Visa's net income rose 15% to $17.3 billion. So, if Visa maintains this growth rate, it will not just meet this required rate of return -- it will crush it. Visa expects to increase its earnings per share in the high-teen percentages in FY 2024, so it's on track to continue this growth rate. Meanwhile, the average Wall Street analyst expects Visa's revenue to rise by about 13.9% annually during the next five years."", 'Visa will clearly be a $1 trillion market-cap company by 2030 as long as these projections hold. Additionally, based on growth forecasts, it should provide market-crushing returns, making it a top stock to buy now. Furthermore, Visa is trading below its decade-long average price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation.', 'Visa has been an incredible investment during the past decade, and all future indications point to another great one to come.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

The widely followed blue chip index declined as much as 22% during the year as recession fears rippled through Wall Street. But with confidence in the economy on the rebound, the Dow recently hit a new record high, signaling the onset of a new bull market. That portends more upward momentum.', 'Historically, the average Dow bull market has lasted almost five years, during which time the index has returned 172%. Investors looking to tap into those gains should consider adding a few shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Visa (NYSE: V) to their portfolios. The stocks have a consensus ""buy"" rating among Wall Street analysts, and neither has a single sell recommendation at the present time.', ""Here's what investors should know about these highly recommended growth stocks."", 'Microsoft has a presence across multiple industries. Its businesses include Xbox consoles and other devices, as well as video games and subscription gaming services. But enterprise software and cloud computing are its core growth engines, and the company has a strong position in both markets.', 'Microsoft collected an industry-leading 16.4% of worldwide software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue in 2022, nearly twice as much as its closest competitor Salesforce. And its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure, accounted for 23% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue in the third quarter, putting the company firmly in second place behind Amazon Web Services.', 'Microsoft sees growth opportunities surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in both markets. For instance, the company recently launched Microsoft 365 Copilot, a natural language interface that automates workflows across office productivity applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Similarly, Microsoft Azure has an exclusive partnership with OpenAI, making it the only cloud provider that offers access to machine learning models like GPT-4, one of the driving forces behind ChatGPT.', ""Microsoft posted impressive financial results in its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30), beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 13% to $56.5 billion on particularly strong sales growth in cloud services, though enterprise software also contributed to top-line momentum. And GAAP net income climbed 27% to $2.99 per share due to disciplined expense management, though the company continued to invest in AI infrastructure."", 'Looking ahead, the enterprise SaaS and cloud computing markets are projected to expand at 14% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Microsoft should be able to match that pace given its strong presence in both spaces, meaning the company has a good shot at low-double-digit revenue growth through the end of the decade.', 'In that light, its current valuation of 12.8 times sales seems tolerable, despite being a premium to the three-year average of 11.4 times sales. Microsoft is a blue chip business that\'s well positioned to monetize AI. In fact, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss sees Microsoft as the software company ""best positioned"" to benefit from growing demand for generative AI.', 'Investors who want a piece of that action will probably have to pay a premium, and now is a reasonable time to buy the stock.', 'Visa operates the largest payments network in the world. Its platform accounted for nearly 39% of card-based purchase transactions in 2022, about five percentage points more than UnionPay and 15 percentage points more than Mastercard. That scale not only creates a powerful network effect, but it also affords the company a significant cost advantage.', 'Specifically, Visa can spread expenses across more transactions than its peers, so the company consistently earns higher margins. That strong profitability allows Visa to reinvest more aggressively in growth, which effectively reinforces its leadership. Some of that reinvested capital is funneled into consumer payments innovations, but the company is also pursuing opportunities in what management calls ""new flows"" (e.g., account-based commercial payments and employee payouts) and value-added services (e.g., risk management solutions).', 'Visa reported wrapped its fiscal 2023 in September with solid financial results. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 11% to $8.6 billion, reflecting modest sales growth in consumer payments and more pronounced sales growth in new flows and value-added services. Visa also reported non-GAAP net income of $2.33 per share, up 21% from the prior year.', 'Looking ahead, global payments revenue is projected to rise at 7% annually through 2027, according to McKinsey & Co. Visa has historically grown more quickly than the broader industry, and investors should expect similar outperformance in the future. Analysts at Morningstar expect annual revenue growth of 10% over the next five years.', ""Visa's current valuation of 16.5 times sales is lower than its three-year average of 18.1.

GPN.', 'Per Mastercard Economics Institute (MEI), the year 2024 will be characterized by easing inflation and a relatively stable labor market fueling consumer spending. As inflation pressure softens across most global economies, consumers will be able to expend more, benefiting companies in the payments space. MEI expects the consumer price index, measuring inflation, to cool down to 4.9% globally in 2024 from 6% in 2023. Although this number will be higher than the pre-pandemic trend of 2.7%, consumer spending should not take a hit as signaled by improved travel-related spending post-pandemic and growth in U.S. retail sales in the 2023 holiday season amid inflationary pressures.', 'Companies in the payments space often resort to mergers and acquisitions strategy, reaping the benefits of diversification. Diversifying around products or geographical markets protects them from resorting to a few selected products or geographies, insulating their top line from unfavorable shocks. Visa and Mastercard undertake several opportunities to expand their geographical reach to new regions and expand business inorganically. The industry has also been undertaking significant technological investments aimed at modernizing the digital payments space.', 'Companies dealing with billions of transactions have the responsibility to protect data. Hence, enhanced security turns out to be an important value proposition for payment companies. With the changing landscape of digital payments, contactless payments or virtual cards are gaining popularity. Per Juniper Research, the global transaction value of contactless payments is expected to be $10 trillion by 2027. Tap to Pay and virtual cards introduced by the companies should act as a key innovation, enhancing its offerings and providing better security. Per Mastercard, virtual cards should bring in savings of 50 cents to $14 per transaction.', 'Amid the looming tensions in the regulatory environment of reducing swipe fees, companies have held their positions firm. Mastercard believes if the swipe fees are reduced, it will have a negative impact on small businesses and consumers. Companies in the payments space utilize the funds generated from swipe fees to enhance security measures and provide reward programs. Curtailing on such a source of revenue might impact the security of transactions, thereby impacting these companies’ core value proposition. Firms in the payments industry are also keeping up with the trends by aiming to gain from technologies like Generative AI, which would transform fraud detection measures.', 'Although the regulatory environment and high interchange fee pressures still linger, a strong labor market and stable inflation level should help in improving the purchasing power of the consumer, benefiting payment companies.', '4 Top Stocks to Watch', 'Here we have picked four payment stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and have the potential to retain a purple patch going forward.

The company's stock performance is consistently driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.Visa's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Shares of Adobe have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+81.5% vs. +60.4%). The company's Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products drove the top-line growth. Further, rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps were positives.Growth in emerging markets, robust online video creation demand and solid adoption of Acrobat are tailwinds. The Zacks analyst remain optimistic about Adobe's market position, compelling product lines, continued innovation, strategic acquisitions and solid adoption of cloud applications. Also, the company's growing generative AI efforts remain a plus.However, the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine remain headwinds for Digital Media segment. Also, high acquisition expenses do not bode well for its margin expansion.(You can read the full research report on Adobe here >>>)Shares of TotalEnergies have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+14.9% vs. +12.2%). The company continues to benefit from startups, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to rapidly growing hydrocarbon-producing regions. Multi-energy portfolio acts as a tailwind for TotalEnergies.The company streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. TotalEnergies is steadily investing to expand its renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.However, the company's production has been impacted by security-related production cuts in some regions. The company remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. A natural decline in production and its withdrawal from Russia might affect profitability.(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include General Electric Co. and Waste Management, Inc.."", ""Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has gained 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.33 per share, indicating a change of +6.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $9.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.14 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $8.51 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.2%.

The MSCI index tracking Latin American stocks edged down 0.3% by 1452 GMT. The equity index is set for an annual gain of 25%, its best year since 2016. A basket of regional currencies was down 0.2% against the dollar and set for annual gains of about 23%, its best year since 2009. The dollar index, however, is set to fall 2%, snapping a two-year winning streak. Latin American assets are set for a strong end to the year after the U.S. Federal Reserve's dovish stance was followed by positive economic data, which bolstered hopes of rate cuts as early as March. Across emerging markets, the Colombian peso is set to be the best-performing currency with annual gains of 25%, its best year since 2004, while the Mexican peso is on track for a yearly gain of 15%, taking the title of the second-best performing currency and set for its best year since 1990. Among stocks, Brazil's Bovespa index, the Peruvian Lima Index and Mexico's IPC stocks index are set to post yearly gains of 22%, 21% and about 19% respectively. Argentina's Merval index rose 1.5%, while one of the most influential workers unions in Argentina has called for a national strike next month as opposition to the government's overhaul of the economy builds. Earlier this week, Argentine President Javier Milei sent a reform bill to Congress proposing far-reaching changes to the country's tax system, electoral law and public debt management. On the data front, Brazil's jobless rate fell to 7.5% in the three months through November, in line with market expectations. Copper output in Chile, the world's largest producer of the red metal, decreased 3.1% year-on-year in November to 444,905 metric tons. For the day, among regional bourses, the Bovespa index was muted, Chilean stocks fell 0.7% and Colombia's Colcap index was up 0.6%. The Brazilian real was down 0.5%, the Mexican peso ticked up 0.3% and the Chilean peso climbed 1.5% for the day.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average, also known as Dow Jones or Dow, is one of the oldest and most followed equity indexes of the United States stock market. It was founded more than a century ago in 1896 by Charles Dow, the editor of the Wall Street Journal at the time. Originally, the Dow comprised just twelve companies that were commodity-focused. In 1928, the index was expanded to 30 stocks. It is a price-weighted index, unlike other market indexes which weigh businesses on their market capitalizations of businesses.\xa0', 'In a stock market filled with uncertainty, investments in the Dow are great for stability and defense. However, in a bull market, the Dow cannot always compete with the growth of other indexes that are more tech heavy. For example, so far this year, the market has responded positively to steady interest rates and slowing inflation. The benchmark S&P 500 has returned more than 24% to investors year-to-date. The NASDAQ Composite has outplaced even the S&P 500, returning over 44% to investors. The Dow has returned around 13%.\xa0', 'However, these numbers do not tell the whole story. The Dow has actually shined for value investors over the long term, unlike the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. For example, despite stellar returns in 2023, the S&P 500 is still slightly off the peak it achieved in early 2022. The NASDAQ is actually down by 5%. The Dow sits handsomely above both these indexes with returns of around 3% during this time span. Stocks on the Dow often lag behind the overall market during bull periods but are resilient against sell-offs during recessions.\xa0', 'Some of the top Dow stocks to buy now include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). These firms have established product lines and steady revenues, a quality that all Dow stocks are famous for. Andrew Witty, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), recently highlighted during the third quarter earnings call that the firm was focused on delivering well-balanced and durable growth for investors.\xa0', ""“As a direct result of mission-driven focus, this year, we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022. By the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at Optum Health, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on Optum Rx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third-quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year."", 'The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models. This year, we expect Optum Health will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources and until now, often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need.”', 'Our Methodology', 'These were picked from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and ranked by hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

I'm Dylan Lewis joining me over the airwaves. Motley Fool Senior analysts Bill Mann and Jason Moser. Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Bill Mann: Hey, nice to see you.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got to look back at 2023 Some of the winners, losers, and things that you might have even forgotten happened this year. We are going to kick off looking at how the market has done this year and some of the stats that paint a picture of 2023. As we tape in mid December, the S&P 500 is up 20% year to date. The Nasdaq is up almost 40% year to date. Bill, if I had told you nothing else and that was all I'd given you, you'd say wow, pretty good year for stocks. Economically, things must be going really well. People must be thrilled."", 'Bill Mann: The 100% chance of recession in 2023 seems to have been a little high.', 'Dylan Lewis: I think so. [laughs].', 'Bill Mann: I thought he was introducing us with a weather report. [laughs]. Back to you, Dylan?', ""Dylan Lewis: Back to me. I think it's just surprising to me, you know, based on all the headlines that we've seen this year, to see those market numbers be as strong as they are. Especially because it seems there's been so much uncertainty and so many things working against strong market returns. Jason, what do you think?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, 7.95% Dylan. That is my statistic. That is my number. That is what I want you to remember for this year. I just googled current 30 year fixed mortgage rates and that's the number I got. Now let's not hall over this, I know that we can all get, or most of us at least, get a mortgage rate a little bit lower than that. But I think that really does tell the tale for what 2023 has been all about. I mean, when you look at the impact that interest rates have on virtually everything else that we do in our lives, it starts to make a lot more sense. But taking a look at the housing market and really how this interest rate environment has ground the housing market to a halt. It's just, it's been, I mean, I'm sure we all probably could have predicted it to an extent, given that we knew that the Fed was going to push rates up like this. But when you look at the data out there. I mean, sales now sit at their lowest level since 2010, according to the latest monthly data from the National Association of Realtors. I mean, you've got median existing home sale price $391,800. That's a 3.4% increase from the previous year, and a new record for October. Understanding that housing kind of underpins so much of what goes on in our economy, it just starts to make a lot more sense that this year of interest rate increases has just had an impact on virtually everything that we do. It's not something that's going to correct itself quickly, I think for folks looking for maybe three, 4% interest rates. Listen, I don't know, those days are ever coming back. Maybe they will one day, but it's not going to be any time soon. I think 2024 will be very lucky to get back to something like 6.5% or something like that if things go well. But to me, the mortgage rate story really has been front and center for 2023."", 'Dylan Lewis: Bill, you took a different angle on this one for your stat of the year, what do you got?', ""Bill Mann: Interestingly enough, the average profit margin for an S&P500 company this year has been 11.9% which is higher, other than 2017, since 1992. It has actually, from a corporate standpoint, been a very good year, despite higher interest rates, despite all of the headwinds that we thought that we were going to be facing. But there is actually another stat that I think is interesting. There is a cliche on Wall Street where analysts come on to the quarterly conference calls, they say great quarter and there's some sociopath out there who tracks this. In this last quarter, analyst praises were down 29% to the lowest level since the first quarter of the pandemic. Great news on one hand and nobody is given anybody any credit."", 'Dylan Lewis: I love that. The technical term there is analyst praises. [laughs] That is the metric that we are tracking. We will add it to the dashboard. That is an absolutely fantastic one.', ""Jason Moser: I was just going to say, I think that may be the first time in motley full money history that the word sociopath has ever been used with you. [laughs] I could be wrong. I think it's at least a possibility."", ""Bill Mann: Who is the person who said, hey, [laughs] I think I'm going to find some Alpha out of this [laughs]."", ""Dylan Lewis: Bill when you see that though is that, in some way, what you're seeing with the profits and expression of the inflationary environment we've been in and companies being able to benefit from it? Or what do you think's been driving that?"", ""Bill Mann: I think that's at least partially true and there are some accounting conventions that allow companies to value the cost of goods sold based on stuff that they've held in inventory for a long time. But I think a lot of it really has to do with the fact that when we think about inflationary environments, we forget about the fact that a lot of times companies are the ones who are benefiting from, or at least they are the ones who are increasing the prices. It tends to work out more OK for them at least in the short run."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's talk about some of the winners and losers of 2023. We're going to dig into some of the best and worst performers so far this year. Jason, let's start out Rosie, I mentioned the S&P500 returns to kick off the show, a couple companies in the S&P 500, a very large part of why the index has done so well this year."", ""Jason Moser: Well, I mean, we've seen, I mean, obviously we talk about the Magnificent Seven a lot. That's something we'll get into a little bit later on here in the show. But I think the one that really stands out in video shares up better than 220% for the year so far. I mean, really it all boils down to, I mean, we know the AI theme. I mean, 2023 has been a year of artificial intelligence. We've talked a lot about where AI can take us. I mean, it is obviously still very early innings, but when you look at the numbers, that NVidia continues to chalk up revenue up 34. The most recent earning score earnings report revenue up 34% from the previous quarter but up to 206% from a year ago. Looking at data center revenue. Which data center? I don't know if you've heard dealing with the data center is a big trend in a lot of tail ones there."", 'Dylan Lewis: Think so.', ""Jason Moser: That revenue up 279% from a year ago. I understand the enthusiasm, I understand the optimism, and I understand why the market is buying this stock handover fist. I think one thing to keep in mind, obviously we talk about a lot. The market is very forward looking. Of course, you have to at least ask yourself, at what point does the enthusiasm start to winter? At what point do we get to where you know that's enough enthusiasm. Now let's see what results this company can bring, because next year I'd be willing to bet those growth rates probably aren't going to be quite as strong as this year. But again, I mean a great company doing a lot of great things, it's no surprise it's performed so well."", ""Dylan Lewis: Given how tech dominated the year and thematically, AI really dominated the year. Looking at the S&P 500 components, I think two companies that jumped out to me as surprises as winners were Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean. I just was amazed to see that those two companies were up 100% year to date. They are off highs from before the pandemic and even some of the highs they hit early in the pandemic. But Bill was just a little amazed to see that they had risen as much as they had. I don't know if that's a return to normal type narrative that we're seeing there or what that might be."", ""Bill Mann: Well, that's definitely true. One thing that we talk about from time to time is that you can find really good investing ideas with companies that simply forget to die. Those were very much two companies that had during the pandemic. The cross-hairs were on them. They had massive assets that weren't being used at all. I mean, good for them, you know, none of it is any laughing matter. But that's where that level of our performance came from. We talked about 2023 as being the year of artificial intelligence. It was also the year of human cause stupidity. At the bottom of the S&P 500 in terms of performance is a company called Dollar General. Dollar General is America's largest retailer, buy outlets. Bloomberg very helpfully says that it has 19,000 locations, the same amount as Walmart and Wendy's combined, which seemed like an odd set of companies to combine. But there you go. One of the biggest problems at Dollar General this year has been self-checkout, which I don't know if I could have predicted anymore that self-checkout was going to be an area where companies that have tiny profit margins, it's probably not going to work out very well. Dollar General almost cut in half this year. Had some terrible storylines about the quality, you know, and the safety in the stores. It has not been a very good year for Dollar General long term, this has been a very good retailer. But I think when you get to the edge of a growth rate for any company, decisions have to be made. A lot of the decisions that Dollar General seems to be making have not worked out at all."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got some stories from 2023 you may have forgotten about and the themes that dominated the year. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined over the airwaves by Bill Mann and Jason Moser. Earlier we talked about the things that jumped out. In 2023 now we're going to talk about some of the things that people may need to get a little reminder of that happened during the year. Jason, what jumps out to you is something that maybe flew under the radar in 2023?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, Dylan, I like food. I like to cook food, I like to eat food. I love to invest in food. Chipotle has been one of my greatest investments, and I just mean, listen, back in June 14th, we saw an IPO. It had been a very IPO thin year. But Cava IPO on June 14th and leading up to that IPO and then really in the subsequent months after, we keep on asking is this the next Chipotle? I think that's a fair question to noodle, right? I mean, when you look at the numbers the company has chalked up, you look at revenue from 2016 up to fiscal 2022, they grew at a 49% compound annual growth rate. They're talking about average unit volumes in 2022, each store pushing through around $2.4 million annually in Chipotle. Around $3,000,000 I mean, they acquired Zoe's before they went public, of course, but they gave them this rich portfolio of real estate to basically open additional covers. They're converting those Zoe's into Vas."", ""They see a market where they can get beyond 1,000 stores and they're going to crack through 300. At the end of this year. They continue to raise guidance talking around 15-16% same store sales growth for the full year here and then you add they're rebooting this loyalty program 3.7 million loyalty members going into this next quarter here, but they're going to revamp this program to try to make it a little bit more in depth, a little bit more rewarding, I think they're going to probably take some lessons learned from other reward programs out there. You start to wonder, is this something that could be the next goal? It is possible. They definitely have a very quality product. The stock has not performed so well since going public down 13% or so year to date. But this is one to keep an eye on. I think a lot of us out there we do like the product and it feels like they have room to open up a number of stores to go. In a very IPO light year, this was just an IPO that stood out as one that you could be wanted to keep an eye on."", ""Dylan Lewis: I like that one, Jason, because I feel there's a lot of fanfare on IPO day and then everything just kind of fades away. Sometimes we need to remind ourselves the company's still there doing its thing. Bill, what's jumping out to you from T 23?"", ""Bill Mann: I don't know if you guys remember COVID-19. Do you guys remember this? Does that ring a bell?"", 'Dylan Lewis: Yeah.', 'Bill Mann: It took up about 2.5 years of our lives in which every conversation it seemed we had with people. Outside of our homes or inside of our homes, it was at the center. Well, in May of this year, Tedroscabrasis, who is the head of the World Health Organization, declared that it was no longer a public health emergency due to COVID-19. In a time in which I seem to go weeks without thinking about it anymore, I just wanted to remind people that it has not been that long since this virus up ended our lives around the world, but 2023 should be remembered as the year in which things started to get back to normal.', ""Dylan Lewis: I think that's a great reminder there, Bill. For my money, I'm going in a different direction on things that we have forgotten about or may need a reminder of for 2023. Do you guys remember the launch of threads?"", ""Jason Moser: I do. I didn't participate, but I do recall."", ""Dylan Lewis: It was the fastest growing app of all time. Logged 100 million sign ups in the first five days, and I have to be honest, I don't know anybody that uses it."", 'Jason Moser: Does it still exist?', 'Bill Mann: It does. It has clubhouse energy. Do you remember clubhouse thread two?', 'Jason Moser: Yeah, mere cat, that was a mere cat.', ""Dylan Lewis: I am fascinated to see where this one goes because according to Meta's management team, it has 100 million monthly active users. I know none of them, and they are planning on expanding into Europe short to continue expanding that offering and I think it's just amazing because it was something that was really coronated as this great appalanche and so successful in the moment, but immediately faded from relevance."", ""Bill Mann: It shows the power, the number of network effects because it's not like the artist formerly known as Twitter has done itself any favors in the process."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, that's a really good point. Like Twitter has given them this market on a series."", ""Bill Mann: Take Twitter and yet take it. Yeah, go ahead. Can't be done."", ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, if you're using threads out there, we want to hear about it. Podcasts@fol.com is where you can sing it."", 'Bill Mann: Hit us up on Twitter ad. [laughs]', ""Dylan Lewis: That's too funny, writes itself. Let's get over to the unavoidable. I'm going to ask each of you to crown the winner of 2023. Jason. Complete the sentence for me here, 2023 was the year of blank."", ""Jason Moser: I mentioned it earlier. I think it was the year of the Magnificent 7. When you look at Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and NVidia, they all just had tremendous years. NVidia, obviously leading the way, but if you held a basket of all seven of these stocks, you did tremendously well, for obvious reasons. I know there's a lot of talk about this great rotation, I pull back on that maybe a little bit. There's no reason to not own really any of these seven business I don't think."", 'Dylan Lewis: Bill, what about you? 2023 was the year of?', 'Bill Mann: Taylor Swift.', 'Dylan Lewis: Has to be.', ""Bill Mann: It has to be. Jason's coming with companies that added $650,000,000,000 in market gap in a single year. Which I understand to be pretty good, but Taylor Swift's tour, her eras tour was so big that it was described by economists as one of the most successful wealth redistribution devices in the last decade. With wealth moving from the upper middle class to other parts of the wealth distribution curve, it's the first tour to earn over $1 billion and it is far from done. When tours earn that much money, that's just talking about what the tour itself is doing. The amount of economic activity that has happened because of Taylor Swift is going to be calculated for a long time and that number will be massive."", ""Dylan Lewis: Bill, so many of the things that Swift has done over the last couple of years seem unprecedented in a lot of ways. The massive concert tour, followed by the movie release, which people in my household saw and absolutely loved, it is on our viewing list as a group at some point soon, but also re recording all of her songs so that she owns them outright. It seems like there is a little bit of a new playbook in the music industry that she's establishing."", ""Bill Mann: Yeah, she's obviously a very talented businesswoman and it's to the point that when FTX collapsed, people were giving Taylor Swift credit that maybe not entirely deserved for not having gotten into NFT's because she was worried about contingent liabilities, but yes, obviously a very savvy businesswoman and a talented artist."", ""Dylan Lewis: Great foresight by Swift there. Bill, Jason, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next we're going to switch from stocks to real estate and talk about the state of housing in 2023. Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, U Sectors caught quite as many headlines in 2023 as the real estate market, high rates and high prices made for a tough environment for buyers, and housing supply continued to lag demand. To get a sense of where the market is now, Motley Fool Money is Deidre Woollard caught up with Dave Meyer, the VP of Growth in analytics, and the host of the On the Market podcast at Bigger Pockets. Dave did talked through the insights from Bigger Pockets State of the Real Estate Investing report, in some interesting areas to watch in 2024."", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm excited to talk about this report and I wanted to figure out, what do you think the big story was in 2023?"", ""Dave Meyer: The big story in 2023 to me is all about inventory in the housing market. I know the predominant media narrative about the housing market is about interest rates. Those are certainly important because that's really impacted demand. But I think that really was predictable. Interest rates went up, that's going to make it less affordable for people to buy homes and therefore we have fewer people interested. But what was less obvious is to the extent that which supply in the market, which in real estate we call inventory, really declined. That has surprisingly held prices relatively steady in the housing market. If there's one thing that surprised me, and I think dictated the market this year, it was inventory levels."", ""Deidre Woollard: The impact of that, the housing affordability has just risen now. It's the lowest opportunity to the housing affordability is now at the lowest rate since the 1980s. It's a terrible situation for a lot of people trying to get in the market. Is there any way that can shift? We know that interest rates are probably going to stabilize next year. What about the inventory rates?"", 'Dave Meyer: I think that\'s the big question and I agree. I do think interest rates will probably peak sometime soon if they haven\'t already and we\'ll start to decline a little bit. I\'m not one at this point in December of 2023 thinking that the Fed is going to cut rates as much as certain people are forecasting. But I do think we\'ll see some mortgage rate relief. But to me, the thing in 2024 is like where does supply come from? Because I\'m having a hard time figuring out where it is. The big thing that\'s impacted supply so far is the ""lock in effect"" if you haven\'t heard of this term, It\'s basically that so many people, about 95% of people, have mortgage rates that are under today\'s current rates. When you think about that, it is not attractive for people to sell because most people who sell a home go on to buy a home as well. When buying conditions deteriorate, that means that people don\'t necessarily want to sell. There\'s been some studies into this by Zillow and another firm called John Burns Research and Consulting. They have found that mortgage rates would have to get to somewhere around five to 5.5% before we start to break this log jam and people start to sell again. Personally, I don\'t see that happening in 2024, so I don\'t really see supply getting that much better. The other places it could come from are potentially foreclosures, which are rising from pre pandemic lows, but are still way below where they were before the pandemic construction has been up or down. But it would take a lot of years of accelerated construction to alleviate the housing shortage. I don\'t personally see any huge increases in supply next year. It will probably go up a bit, but to pre pandemic levels, I don\'t really see that happening anytime soon.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, and it's really been this way since the great financial crisis. They had a report a few years out that predicted the silver tsunami of all the retirees that we're going to sell didn't happen yet. May happen at some point, but in the report, you did note the new listings which usually fall in the second half of the year. They weren't following the usual pattern. They're up a little bit, not a lot. I think the latest NR report was like 3.6 months, which is still way below what we need. But it brings up another question for me, which I've noticed over the last few years, is that the traditional real estate cycles of April through October being the time when everything's on the market. We seem to be getting away from that are kind of is the seasonal dynamic shifting in real estate."", ""Dave Meyer: It does seem to be that way and I think it will be interesting to see what happens this year, but for the last two or three years, it has really bucked a lot of trends. As you said, normally what we see is housing prices for the year bottom out around January, February, and then they steadily rise through the end of the second quarter, usually peaking somewhere in May or June. Then they gradually decline a little bit through the end of the year. Now we're just seeing all different things happen. It's hard to nail that down. I do think we'll probably still see some deviation from normal seasonal patterns until interest rates come back down a little bit, and probably until we have a little more economic certainty. There's just been so many anomalous economic events over the last three years. I think they're still rippling through the housing market and it's going to be a little while until they settle back into the normal patterns."", ""Deidre Woollard: I think that makes it challenging for buyers who have been taught that they don't, you know, so the thing has always been maybe you'll get a better deal in January or October after everybody else has sort of stopped looking because school's back in session, doesn't seem to be the case anymore, which I think makes it tougher for people trying to get in the market."", ""Dave Meyer: Definitely. I think normally it's somewhere around two or 3%. If you're buying them medium price home, which in the US is $400,000 it'll save you eight or $12,000 by waiting to the winter, which is great. On top of just the financial gain, I think a lot of people like the decreased competition, where you don't have to make these offers sight unseen or you're not bidding against a lot of people. That is the benefit of typically buying this time of year. Even though there's sometimes less options for you to see. Right now I think most behavior is really rate driven. You just see even when there's slight deviations in mortgage rates right now, the demand for mortgages, which is sort of how we measure demand in the housing market. You look at how many people apply for a mortgage in a given week. It's really sensitive right now. Like if you go back to 2018, 2019, if mortgage rates changed by 20 basis points, nothing happened. It really just wasn't that big of a deal. Now people who want to buy are waiting and say, OK, drop from 7.2 to 7.3 Like now we're going to jump in. It's not like a huge rush of people, but you do see those slight deviations dictating demand in the market."", ""Deidre Woollard: The home builders have been talking a lot about that, is they've seen that massive fluctuation in terms of people coming in and then changing their mind as soon as rates shift. I wanted to talk about a phrase I heard recently I can't get off inside of my head and that was that the single family rental is the new starter home for many Americans. If you're a real estate investor, that should be good news, right?"", 'Dave Meyer: What does that mean that the single family rental, so most people are buying a single family rental instead of their starter home?', ""Deidre Woollard: No. Most people can't get into the starter home, so they're getting the single family rental. They're going from like you get your first apartment as a young person, then you move up to the single family rental and you may or may not be able to eventually afford because of the housing affordability problem."", 'Dave Meyer: Okay. I think that housing affordability is a huge issue and I am an investor, but I don\'t think it\'s great that people can\'t afford homes. I would rather more people be able to afford a starter home. That said, I do think a lot of this narrative that everyone is turning to a renter is a little bit overblown. If you look at the data for the home ownership rate going back like 50 or 60 years, it is very stable in the United States. It\'s always between 63-68% and right now it\'s 66. It\'s right where it normally is. Now I do think there is danger that gets worse, but just right now, you hear that phrase ""Renter nation."" But I think honestly it makes sense. I know culturally in the United States, we\'ve created this narrative that to be successful, you need to own a home. And it is a good way to build some wealth. But if you actually do the math right now, it is better to rent than to buy in almost any city.', ""I am a real estate investor, I rent my home, because I think I'm better off putting that would be down payment into investments like rental properties rather than into my own property right now. I do think there is a little bit of truth to that and I think that's just generally true, but I also think this goes to the home building situation as well, which is that we just don't build starter home size properties in the United States anymore. The average home built, I don't know the exact number so correct me if I'm wrong here, excuse me if I'm a little off, but I think it used to be, like in the '90s it was 1,400 square feet and now it's like 2,400 square feet. What makes money for builders is bigger homes, and unfortunately, that's not things that first time home buyers can afford so there is this mismatch between the product that is being built and what people in our country actually want and need. That's probably creating more demand for the single family rentals."", ""Deidre Woollard: Let's talk a little bit about next year and what might happen. Personally, I'm hoping that 2024 is the year we break our obsession with the Fed, that maybe we get limited moves in either direction. What do you think of that? Will that create a better investing environment?"", ""Dave Meyer: I would love to go a week without talking about the Fed in my life. [laughs] You and I think talk on podcast a lot is a very common topic these days. I do think it's going to be a more quiet year. I think a lot of what's going to happen next year in the housing market, is going to be determined by the Fed pausing. Not necessarily what happens with the federal funds rate. Because mortgage rates obviously are impacted by the federal funds rate, but it really has a lot more to do with bond yields and what's going on with the mortgage backed securities markets so those things are obviously impacted by the Fed, but are also highly influenced by what's going on in the stock market and what is going on in the broader economy and recession risk. I think as the economy, and hopefully gets a little bit more clear, we will get some stability in the mortgage market and my hope is that, housing volume starts to pick up and we can no longer be talking about the Fed every six weeks."", ""Deidre Woollard: I would like that as well. It's interesting because, one of the things the report mentions and one of the things that I've seen over the years is not all types of real estate investing works in all markets. So as we think about 2024, I've noticed an uptick in lending in private credit, but what do you think about a strategies that are more attractive next year?"", ""Dave Meyer: Lending is great. Obviously, in a high interest rate environment, the people who benefit are people who lend so that is always good. It's not necessarily the easiest way to get into real estate investing unless you are an accredited investor where you can do funds, which is a good way to do it. I think there's a couple strategies. One is a term called house hacking. If you haven't heard that, it's basically an owner-occupied strategy. This is great because as we were talking about rentals, it is expensive to buy your first home. Basically, if you buy a duplex or a triplex or a quadplex, live in one unit and rent out the other ones, it can either help you cash flow or greatly reduce your cost of living, your housing costs, and you get the benefit of residential financing. You can actually buy three or four units, putting 10% down and getting those better rates. Actually just this year, there are some rules now that have made that a little bit easier so I just said that you can buy four units and put five or 10% down. Last year, that wasn't possible. That is a new thing that is coming out and is making it easier for people to do this house hacking strategy. There's also a new rule that allows investors to count revenue from an ADU, which is an accessory dwelling unit. It's like an apartment over your garage or a mother in law suite toward your mortgage qualification. Previously if you had an extra unit on your property and you rented it out, that didn't count toward your debt to income ratio. Now it will, so that will make it easier for people to qualify for those types of loans. I think house hacking in general really works in almost any market in the country and really in any type of economic conditions because its aim is really to just reduce your housing cost, which you can use to invest in more real estate or in equities or something else."", ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, if you want to dive into the insights from Dave and his team at Bigger Pockets, there's a link in the show description.

We saw food chains continue to bring new and different things for us to taste. McDonald's had the grimace birthday meal complete with a purple shake, Burger King brought out the fiery nuggets and Italian royal crispy sandwich, and Wendy's brought back their strawberry frosty due to popular demand. Jason, of those four that I just threw out there, which one is going in your takeout order?"", ""Jason Moser: Holy cow, man. They're all really good choices. You know what? I'm already looking forward to spring and summer and golf, strawberry Frosty just has me feeling the vibe. Let's go strawberry Frosty."", 'Dylan Lewis: Jason is going strawberry Frosty, Bill what about you?', 'Bill Mann: How do you not go with fiery nuggets?', 'Dan Boyd: I like fiery nuggets.', 'Dylan Lewis: If i can play mediator here. I think those two would go pretty well together.', 'Bill Mann: Do you dunk your nuggets into the frosty?', 'Dylan Lewis: Absolutely.', 'Jason Moser: Scared to try.', ""Dylan Lewis: Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Bill, you're up first. What are you looking at?"", ""Bill Mann: I am looking at a company called CRISPR Therapeutics, ticker is CRSP. They accomplished something phenomenal this last week in which their treatment for sickle cell anemia was passed. It's them along with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. This is one of the few companies that has a Nobel Prize winning technology attached to it. It is gene editing. I don't really expect there to be a huge amount of revenues to CRISPR from this, but it's a little bit like the Tesla Roadster. Something that has come out that maybe is not economically going to be beneficial, but it is an incredible proof of concept. CRISPR Therapeutics, very little revenue, highly speculative company, but a company that I think should take a bow for what they have achieved in the area of scientific discovery."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about CRISPR.', 'Dan Boyd: Bill, so this stock, if you held it for a long time, has been basically flat if you go.', ""Bill Mann: If you're lucky."", ""Dan Boyd: Four years. Is this the stock that you're more of like invest in how you want the world to be stock or the kind of stock that you actually expect to make returns?"", ""Bill Mann: It's a little bit of both. Obviously, gene editing is a Holy Grail technology and there are so many different implications that we will be able to have personalized medical treatment for so many different therapies. If you can literally go in and almost like a Word document, go in and edit someone's DNA in order to fix a number of genetic problems, it's going to take a while, but I think that this company will be a stock success before it is a commercial success because people will see it coming."", 'Dylan Lewis: Jason, what is on your radar this weekend?', 'Jason Moser: Well, we all know the Internet is full of bad actors looking to steal identity, data information. Identity security represents an $80 billion total addressable market opportunity today, globally speaking. Okta is a company that sells its software and services to businesses of all sizes in order to help companies stay secure and making sure that access to their systems and services are available to the right people at the right time, in the right place. As you may guess Dylan, Dan, I\'m going with Okta, ticker is OKTA. Okta\'s business it\'s supported at the top by the Okta identity platform that ultimately helps empower the workforce identity cloud and their customer identity cloud. They claim over 18,800 organizations as customers today, revenues continue to grow at very impressive rates. Even in this day and age Dylan of elongated sales cycles, we\'ve talked about that a few times on this show, there\'s a little bit of a last ""have at thee"" vibe, the recent security breach. But honestly I think with companies like these, you have to assume breaches are a matter of when, not if it\'s a matter of how they respond to these breaches. I think Okta has done a very good job. But I do think the pullback in shares here represents an opportunity for investors.', 'Dylan Lewis: Dan a question about Okta.', ""Dan Boyd: Not a question, more of a comment.

But the tech trade is not the only industry that has benefitted this past year.', 'Yahoo Finance Live examines several other outperformers across industries, including cruise operators Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Carnival Corp. (CCL), and even retail chain Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF). Solar energy stocks disappointed in 2023 as significant players saw big annual losses.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '- Tesla, NVIDIA, and Apple among the best performers in our top trending tickers of the year. All of these names having a lot of excitement on the AI play, also part of the Magnificent Seven when you look at an NVIDIA and an Apple.', ""Interesting too. I've been seeing some charts comparing Tesla's performance to Bitcoin. And they fall in very similar highs and lows throughout the year. So maybe a similar investing profile there."", 'But not surprising to see these names doing well in a year where we were looking for some safe haven trades in these big tech names that were powered by the AI boom.', '- Yeah, so Tesla and Apple having their best years since 2020. Interesting because as Steve Sosnick mentioned to us a little while ago. Revenue was declining for Apple. And yet the stock still managed to gain. NVIDIA not surprisingly, best year ever in terms of its performance, powering it to a new record.', 'What I find interesting about these three names as well is that they are all well-known. NVIDIA has become a well-known consumer name, even though it is not a directly consumer facing product obviously. But it goes into a lot of products that consumers use.', ""So it's interesting, the intersection between them being of most interest to Yahoo Finance users, them being top performers. And hopefully for people, they were long these names. And they ended up having a good year."", ""- Hopefully, they were happy. I mean, I'm really interested to see how the Tesla double clickers on our platform feel heading into next year. We know that UBS is anticipating that electric vehicle sales were about 47% this year and growth. That's going to go down to 11% growth next year."", ""That's not necessarily a good leading indicator if you're long on a name like Tesla. But maybe the AI boom, maybe if they can mention that enough times on an earnings call. That'll help them."", ""- Well, and also Elon Musk has tried to manage expectations around that as well and tried to set the bar kind of low going into next year. Let's also take a look at some of the other stocks that we've been watching closely this year."", 'Cruise stock sort of a surprise here at the top of the S&P 500 along with these large cap tech stocks. Royal Caribbean, the third best performer in the S&P 500. Carnival coming in at number 6 here.', ""So it's been very interesting to see these cruise stocks really perform well and finished the year strong, as well as we got the so-called revenge travel boom. And we just recently spoke to Josh Weinstein, who's the CEO at Carnival. And he talked about the visibility that they have into 2024 is remarkable."", 'The bookings. The strength in bookings that they are seeing at this point in the year he says is basically the best that it has ever been at this point looking out into next year. And so investors really paying attention to that.', ""Debt is still an issue for some of these cruise line operators. But they're working to address it. That's something also that investors have been happy about."", ""- It's another one of those surprising names because I keep waiting to see evidence of this shift away from services over to goods. So you see a Royal Caribbean performing well in the stock market, you see a Nike down. I'm not seeing the big shift from service spending to goods spending in that exact comparison dynamic."", ""So I wonder whether or not that prediction is going to play out is inflation making consumers maybe think, OK, a cruise, you can get a little bit more bang for your buck in that type of travel. Or is revenge travel just here to stay. People got used to traveling a lot. And now they're going to continue."", ""- We'll see."", ""- Yeah, we'll see. As always, Julie."", ""- Well, and to round things off, we've got some surprising performances of the year."", '- We do have some surprising performances of the year, Julie. Thanks for that. I do want to talk about Abercrombie & Fitch. Not to really pull away from Brian Sozzi here by talking about this name. I know he loves to talk about it.', 'But this name is up 300%. If you look at the S&P 1500 index. So a little bit of a stretch there. But outperforming NVIDIA, if you look at their 260% year to date returns, Julie.', 'So I just found that really interesting. This is one of those names where the CEO Fran Horowitz has been able to really rebrand the company. Having obviously a lot of public relations challenges over the years. Expanding also into things like athleisure, workwear, event wear, and that kind of product diversification has been rewarded by the street and by consumer sales.', ""- Something I found so fascinating about Abercrombie is it's sort of grown with its customer base. I think of Abercrombie or I thought of Abercrombie as largely a teen brand. But I know many of the 20 and 30 somethings at the office who love it going back to our anecdata, right?"", '- Yeah.', ""- So I think that's kind of a fun thing about Abercrombie. The big surprise for me this year, one of the big surprises has been the underperformance of solar stocks, right? The Invesco Solar ETF seeing a decline of about 26% this year."", ""Tan is the ticker on that. Why has it been surprising? Well, and we've seen some individual stocks do really lousy as well."", 'Because we had the IRA, right? The Inflation Reduction Act that was supposed to really inject a lot of incentives into this industry. One of the things that has hurt the industry has been California has sort of changed the way it subsidized, rooftop solar panels, that was a setback for the industry.', ""And we've seen residential solar installations according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance which tracks this industry very closely. Residential solar installations in the US rose an average of 32% per year from 2019 through 2022."", ""Now they're looking for only 5% annual growth for the rest of the decade. So there's just been a real slowdown there. And we have seen the stocks follow suit. Although, there is some bullishness from the street on solar going into 2024. Again, we'll see."", ""- Again, we'll see. And again, I feel like that's another one of those baskets that kind of depends on where things go with the Fed because of the way those contracts are financed.

To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

Although there's some concern that Amazon could struggle if the U.S. economy weakens in 2024, the segments that matter most for this juggernaut are still firing on all cylinders."", ""Most consumers are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2022, Insider Intelligence (formerly known as eMarketer) estimated that Amazon brought in nearly 40% of all online retail sales in the United States. However, online retail sales yield razor-thin margins. While its online marketplace is a big-time revenue producer, Amazon's operating cash flow and income are predominantly derived from its ancillary segments."", ""None of these divisions is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS). According to estimates from tech-analysis company Canalys, AWS accounted for 31% of global cloud infrastructure service share in the September-ended quarter. Enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure is still very early in its ramp, which suggests sustained double-digit growth is likely throughout the decade (if not beyond). AWS is consistently responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income despite the fact that it only accounts for about a sixth of the company's net sales."", ""Amazon's subscription services and advertising services segments are important cash flow drivers, too. Amazon has signed up more than 200 million people globally to a Prime subscription. Further, its online marketplace is attracting more than 2 billion people to its site each month. That's a recipe for strong ad-pricing power with merchants."", ""Though Amazon isn't inexpensive from a traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio standpoint, it's historically cheap relative to its future cash flow. Since the company reinvests most of its cash flow back into its business, this price-to-cash-flow metric is far more telling of how cheap Amazon stock is right now."", ""A second unsurpassed growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market decline is small-cap furniture stock Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE). While recessionary fears have the potential to weigh down the traditionally stodgy furniture industry, Lovesac's out-of-the-box innovations show it's not like its brick-and-mortar peers."", 'The differentiation between Lovesac and every other furniture company is readily apparent in its products. ""Sactionals"" -- modular couches that can be rearranged to fit most living spaces -- account for just shy of 90% of Lovesac\'s net sales. Sactionals have more than 200 different cover choices, and the yarn used in their production is derived entirely from recycled plastic water bottles. It\'s worth noting that sactionals have an abundance of upgrade options available, too, including built-in surround sound and wireless charging stations.', ""As you may have guessed, this differentiation does make sactionals costlier than a traditional sofa or sectional couch. But this priciness is actually a competitive advantage for the company. It's specifically targeting middle- and upper-income consumers who are less likely to alter their buying habits during economic downturns."", ""Lovesac's omnichannel sales platform is another key to its success. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lovesac was able to pivot its sales online easily. While it does have a physical presence in 40 U.S. states, it hedges its brick-and-mortar sales with popup showrooms, brand-name partnerships, and direct-to-consumer sales. This strategy lowers its overhead expenses and lifts its operating margin."", 'Considering its low double-digit annual sales growth, Lovesac looks like quite the bargain at 12 times forward-year earnings.', ""The third top-notch growth stock you'll regret not scooping up in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market drop is media company Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). Though the COVID-19 pandemic clobbered multiple facets of Disney's operations, such as its theme parks and film division, numerous catalysts are now set to act as tailwinds."", ""To build on the obvious, Walt Disney should see a steady rebound in its film entertainment division and theme park operations as life returns to normal and attendance picks up. These bread-and-butter segments, which are fueled by Disney's exceptionally valuable brand and strong pricing power, can sustain double-digit earnings growth over the next five years."", ""Even more important, Walt Disney's storytelling and engagement simply can't be duplicated by other companies.

Consumers will willingly pay a premium for the Disney experience."", ""Another catalyst for Walt Disney is the expected improvement in the company's streaming operations. Increasing monthly subscription prices on its various service tiers will bring in additional revenue that, along with mindful cost-cutting, should shift this segment to profitability toward the end of fiscal 2024."", ""A forward P/E ratio of 17 for an industry leader that's expected to deliver annualized earnings growth of 15.4% over the next five years is a screaming bargain."", ""The fourth unsurpassed growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is ultra-popular coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX).

Starbucks closed out fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 1) with 32.6 million active Rewards Members.

Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Brad Smith break down the 2024 plans for Starbucks (SBUX), Disney (DIS), and Gap (GPS)."", 'Starbucks has laid out a 3-year plan to unlock $3 billion in efficiencies while also trying to repair partner culture amid unionization efforts.', 'Disney has announced workforce reductions to control costs under returning CEO Bob Iger, who faces activist pressure to invest more in high-potential areas like parks.', 'Gap starts the year with new CEO Richard Dickson at the helm following store closures and sales declines. With a marketing background, Dickson may unveil a restructuring within 6-12 months to catalyze a turnaround.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '[AUDIO LOGO]', 'BRIAN SOZZI: 2023 was the year of change, with companies touting plans to evolve their business for the future.', ""Starbucks announced its triple shot reinvention back in November, as it strives for long-term growth. I guess that's a well named hat tip to the Starbucks marketing department for cooking that one up. But if you go back to this release on what this reinvention plan is, two things stick out to me or really stand out to me that Starbucks has to start delivering on next year, if this stock is going to come off the lows. Really dreadful year for Starbucks investors."", ""One, unlock efficiency. As part of this plan, Starbucks trying to generate $3 billion in savings over 3 years, $2 billion of that outside the store. So things it's doing outside of its own stores that are probably wasteful, make no sense, and should be cut."", 'And then number two, reinvigorate, Brad, the partner culture. And this is really speaking to I think the ongoing union issues that continue to plague Starbucks. I think some folks could easily make the argument they continue to get worse. Bottom line for me is that they are not going anywhere.', ""And like we said yesterday and even earlier in the week, Starbucks has to address this. Get it done and dusted once and for all whatever that might mean, but probably come at the expense of the company's bottom line."", ""BRAD SMITH: So here's some of the benchmarks that you can read Starbucks up against, especially for this reinvention plan-- the triple shot reinvention plan, as you mentioned a moment ago. As the company has set out some of these goals. Growing comps by 5% to 7%, with revenue growth at the low end of the 10% to 12% range. Earnings growth of 15% to 20%. You can grade them on that based on some of the prevailing trends that they set guidance for fiscal 2024."", ""Bottom line here though, you got to think about the international relevance of this brand as well. They're talking within this plan about what's the growth needs to look like both here domestically but as well as internationally and in the core market of China."", ""And so one of the huge things that is important to remember is especially across some of the plays that can be looked at like a Starbucks, where you still need to have a strong corporate and also relationship with the franchisees, the partners as they call them, where those partners might be tough to find, especially in a tough purchasing or tough financing environment like we're in right now. And perhaps that's only going to get more difficult for the company going into next year."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Just give me a cheaper iced coffee, Starbucks.', ""BRAD SMITH: I just want the unicorn frappe to come back. Also, let's talk about a magical place, Disney. Less magical this year. They launched a reinvention plan of its own with Bob Iger back at the helm, starting with job cuts. Those job cuts coming early in the year."", 'This was a way that Bob Iger was trying to signal to the activist campaigns that were coming out of nowhere like Dikembe Mutombo blocking a shot that was unexpected for any basketball players out there. You know the reference. The finger-wagging, the activist campaigns were essentially throwing at Disney as well as the statistics.', ""At the end of the day, that was his own type of efforts to try and say, hey, I've got a handle on costs. I have a handle on getting back to profit. And, oh, yeah, by the way, we might be thinking about a life without ESPN here at Disney. That's still some of the larger questions that lingered."", ""And even after that later on in the year you saw this company hit, what, eight year lows. So a lot of these questions still linger, as well as just I think longer leadership question at the company of who's after Iger at the end of the day because that's still unclear at this point."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: And what do you do with these legacy assets. Now, we're still watching Paramount reportedly shopping itself, whether they go to Warner Brothers Discovery. That is to be determined."", ""But it's one thing for investors to speculate and analysts to speculate, sure, sell off your legacy TV assets like ABC, Disney. But who is buying it? You have to have a willing buyer, and it has to come at a good price. You just don't say, hey, we're going to just unload these assets and they're just going to float out there in the ether sphere."", ""And I just think, Brad, it's going to be hard for Iger to do this because it would be him acknowledging that he didn't see this coming 10 years ago. And he would really I think hurt his legacy if he were to spin off these assets."", ""BRAD SMITH: And at the end of the day too, you've got to think about what they're going to do to continue to invest in some of the businesses that they've signaled that they're going to develop even more on top of, I think most notably at the parks and resorts business. More expansion internationally. More development upon the thousands of acres of land that they've got in Florida that are undeveloped at this point too. So that's more money that's potentially going out the door."", ""But to buy into or to spend into an experience where they're already going to be charging the customer more. And that's another element where the customer is going to have to grapple with how much are we comfortable to pay for those magical passes that allow us to skip the line when we go to Disney World."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: So true. All right. And lastly, and Gap. The company has struggled to connect with consumers, but its new CEO is looking to change that. And, Brad, look, I've been very critical of Gap for going on over 10 years, sales have just been dreadful. Margins dreadful. They've closed hundreds of stores."", ""And it's not just the Gap division. It's been the Old Navy division. The Banana Republic division sometimes call falls into favor with investors. But now the new CEO Richard Dickson, really the guy who saved Mattel now at the helm over at Gap."", ""And I've had the time, I've had a moment to just connect with Richard on just to get a sense of what he might be focusing on for 2024. I do think you will see an investor day from Gap at some point middle of next year, where they try to reset the investor narrative for the company."", ""But as I've learned covering CEOs for a long time, any new CEO is likely within their first 6 to 12 months come out with some form of restructuring plan. I think that is going to be a key initial playbook by Richard, whether it is closing more stores, fine tuning its manufacturing capacity. I do think that plan will hit in the first half of next year."", 'And then secondarily, what Richard does very well is marketing. He is a marketing whiz, but he also, I think he understands the apparel industry, having spent a long time over at Jones Apparel Group. I think he will bring more stylish things that human beings want to actually buy from a Gap and Republic inside of their stores next year. But again, a big turnaround in a tall ask to drive that turnaround over at Gap.', ""BRAD SMITH: Does it mean from your perspective because you've covered this company for a long time. Does it mean that they need to grow up another in-house brand? And I think about what they're doing that started off as a relevance and kind of collaboration partnership with Dapper Dan and starting Gap underneath of Gap and having a few hoodies there. But now they're expanding that into a kid's clothing line. Does it need another kind of reinvigoration of the brand with another subsidy within there?"", 'BRIAN SOZZI: All three a curveball. I think Gap and Richard, they have to go back and consider splitting the company back up now. This is on the table a couple of years ago. Prior management ultimately decided not to do it. I just think it would be more value creating for these brands to trade on their own merit, and ultimately that would drive more focus with each brand. Gap is focused on Gap. Banana is focused on Banana. And Old Navy of course, focused on Old Navy.', ""We also want to talk about one more stock that's striving for its own reinvention plan. That's Beyond Meat. My team letting me mention this yet again. Stock really shot up over 8% about a half an hour ago on our analysis. Of course, we had a really exclusive interview with Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown."", 'Stock pulling back a little bit. But nonetheless, I think Ethan is trying to figure out what gets more people back into the plant-based meat category and something that Peter McGinnis, his counterpart, the CEO of Impossible Foods, is trying to do as well.', ""BRAD SMITH: Got to just ask yourself, has it bottomed out? I mean, this is a company in Beyond Meat that it was really a gauge for another company in Impossible Foods, which at the time was a unicorn. I don't know what their valuation is at this point. It's kind of fallen into obscurity at this juncture."", 'But for Beyond Meat, still the closest thing that anybody in the market has to look at as an alternative meat play that is out there and has its own operations now and that is trying to get more partnerships, both on the wholesale partnership side, going into more of the retail footprints.', ""And then on the restaurant side, trying to drum up even more demand for beyond what beyond bacon, egg, and cheese in the morning or beyond sausage, egg, and cheese. I don't even know if they do bacon yet. But at the end of the day, it's going to require them to get into more meats."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. More meats.', 'BRAD SMITH: More meats.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: It's going to come."", 'BRAD SMITH: More meats for you.']"

The combination of its impeccable balance sheet, its market position, its product and service ecosystem, and its ability to generate tons of cash and buy back stock gives it the financial muscle needed to deliver shareholder value for years to come.', ""Meanwhile, Microsoft could become the most important stock in the Dow. Like Apple, it has the balance sheet and cash flow to fuel growth. More than any other major company, it has a clear path toward generating near-term returns from artificial intelligence. Microsoft's balance of short-term and long-term potential makes it an attractive stock to buy, even after its blistering run-up this year."", ""The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average Trust (one of the largest Dow ETFs) has a price-to-earnings ratio of 22.1 -- which is slightly below the 23.9 ratio of the SPDR S&P 500 Trust.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average, also known as Dow Jones or Dow, is one of the oldest and most followed equity indexes of the United States stock market. It was founded more than a century ago in 1896 by Charles Dow, the editor of the Wall Street Journal at the time. Originally, the Dow comprised just twelve companies that were commodity-focused. In 1928, the index was expanded to 30 stocks. It is a price-weighted index, unlike other market indexes which weigh businesses on their market capitalizations of businesses.\xa0', 'In a stock market filled with uncertainty, investments in the Dow are great for stability and defense. However, in a bull market, the Dow cannot always compete with the growth of other indexes that are more tech heavy. For example, so far this year, the market has responded positively to steady interest rates and slowing inflation. The benchmark S&P 500 has returned more than 24% to investors year-to-date. The NASDAQ Composite has outplaced even the S&P 500, returning over 44% to investors. The Dow has returned around 13%.\xa0', 'However, these numbers do not tell the whole story. The Dow has actually shined for value investors over the long term, unlike the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. For example, despite stellar returns in 2023, the S&P 500 is still slightly off the peak it achieved in early 2022. The NASDAQ is actually down by 5%. The Dow sits handsomely above both these indexes with returns of around 3% during this time span.

Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share.

But we're going to start out talking about an item that might be on a lot of holiday gift lists this year, Tim, and that's the Apple watch. If you're in the market for one, if it is on your shopping list for someone for Christmas, you better act soon based on the current state of things because Apple will pause selling some of its latest models before Christmas, Tim."", ""Tim Beyers: Yeah, it's really interesting. Sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 are supposed to be halted. This is according to Fortune here at the company's online store as of the 21st. So we are recording on the 20th, so that is tomorrow. At its physical retail locations, apparently beginning on Christmas Eve, giddy up, hurry up and get in there and get one. Apparently, this is because of a ruling by the International Trade Commission from October that said that Apple has violated patents from Masemo that include in these watches a blood oxygen sensor. It looks like a software patent here that Apple has violated. I think it is interesting. I know that Apple has been very interested, and I have seen this myself. Apple is pinging me even on my old, my ancient iPhone SC to use the health features on my iPhone more often. It wants me to do things like learn to use walking speed on my iPhone. Apparently I have to download another app to do this. But the watch was really the entry point for Apple introducing more health related innovations into the ecosystem and making its devices much more attractive to the health conscious consumer.

Now, there's probably a lawyer out there who is yelling into their phone, and we want to hear that feedback. I want to hear why I'm wrong about this. It feels wrong to me, Dylan. But there's probably a very good legal reason why Apple has to go take a strident defense here. Especially since, to your point, Apple's going to sell these watches, they're going to move. I don't think anybody believes that come January 2nd, there's going to be a bunch of unsold, Ultra Apple watches just sitting on shelves or sitting in a back room somewhere like the Ark of the Covenant, in the back of some government warehouse somewhere.

I'm curious, how does the market, or how do investors look at a news piece like this? Because it sounds bad, but also the stock is totally unfazed."", ""Tim Beyers: That's probably because we expect nothing from Comcast. Is this surprising? No. This is the stock market often trades on expectations. The expectations for Comcast are like shrug of Mochi. They did it again. I'm disappointed. Shocker. Not I have Comcast. It's not like I am anti-Comcast or anything. I think Xfinity is actually a fairly good service here. But they just don't have a whole ton of competition here. We've come to accept that there are some sub optimal things that come with Xfinity. But I will say here, Dylan, this one is squarely on them. I think there's a larger narrative that we need to pay attention to. NetScaler, which is part of Citrix here, did put out a fix for this. Their Cloud Software Group released a build which affected the vulnerability here. This was on October 10th. The vulnerability was targeted at NetScaler application device controller and the NetScaler gateway. They warned that if this was exploited, you could end up with allowing your network to have unauthorized data access."", ""What Comcast said, and which really stinks here, and this is according to the Verge, that the exploit, there was unauthorized access between October 16th and October 19th. Almost a week later. There had been a patch that was issued. They said, hey, this is a problem, fix it. Please fix it to all customers. This is according to the blog post that the company put out. Comcast didn't fix it, apparently. We don't know. We don't really have all the details here. But it doesn't look like they fixed it. Because they said this happened between October 16th and October 19th, and if a fix was available on the 10th, what happened here? A shout out to my friend and a partner on this week in Tech, Tim White, who had been talking about for a while now, and I think made a pretty accurate prediction about we can expect there to be lawsuits around cybersecurity liability, or real focus on insurance, writing insurance policy around legal liabilities, having to do with cybersecurity breaches."", ""Because it's becoming more, and more, and more common. In this particular case, these breaches do appear to have something to do with just how you orchestrate what's called a virtual private network. A VPN is essentially, if you could think about, it's like going into your house, you enter your house and now, one key gets you in the front door, and now you can go anywhere inside your house. Unrestricted access, and that's like a VPN. You get into the corporate network, you enter through the front door, and once you're through the front door, you have mostly unrestricted access. And of course, these miscreants got access to a lot of customer data, and now that's a problem for Comcast. That's very different than what some of the other players have been talking about. The biggest one here that's been talking about it is Zscaler. We're talks about zero trust and the idea of no, let's not have just one door and you get access to everything. We're going to give you zero trust. Once you enter a door and you get into a space, when you want to go to another space, you got to ask for permission again. We're not going to trust you every time. You got to keep asking for more permission. I think this is the beginning. The more we see this, Dylan, the more this is going to change how companies think about security policy. If I'm an investor, I really don't want to be investing in a company that has access to a lot of customer data online and doesn't have a strategy for protecting that customer data. That's got to be part of my risk analysis now. I mean, it's a big deal."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tim Comcast is not alone in being hit by this, Boeing and Toyota also hit as well, and I think as investors we only have so much control over that. Companies only have so much control over that. To a certain extent, there's a sense of randomness to it is your view on this that what companies do have control over is the way they respond, and it sounds maybe Comcast did not respond in a way that you were particularly happy about. Also just the procedures they have in place and the data management network management procedures that they have to try to ensure that they can make things as secure as possible."", ""Tim Beyers: I just don't think you can be lazy here. I mean, if anything, I should be careful about making a judgment here because I don't want to call Comcast engineers lazy. That's not right. This is a mistake and I think we should label it as a mistake. But the environment is such that there isn't a lot of room for mistakes Dylan, if you've got to patch a piece of software and you're being told by your provider, hey, patch this piece of software and do it now, then do it now, no not wait. If that is a problem for you, then get a different system that doesn't require you to do patching in the same way that your existing system does. This is going to become an increasingly big deal, so it has some implications for security providers it's probably good for companies like Zscaler, CrowdStrike, lot of Cloud security providers. It gives them more ammunition for their argument as to why you should upgrade, and at the same time, it puts a lot of pressure on chief information officers, chief information security officers, CTO's to say like, look, what is our security policy? What is our posture? What do we need to upgrade? Let's do it now."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tim, our final story moves us away from digital goods and assets and over to the physical world. FedEx shares down almost 10% after the company released fiscal Q2 earnings and results came in a little bit below expectations. But it seems like Tim for me, the company's guidance showing another quarter of year over year declines is really what's getting the headlines and really what's moving the stock today."", ""Tim Beyers: It seems like it, I mean, so the reported earnings per share of $3.99 were well under the expectations of $4.19. Overall sales down from 22.8 billion the year prior to 22.2 billion. That's problematic. That's down not quite 3% but down enough. It just doesn't look quite right now. They've cut costs materially and overall operating profit margins were up here. The first thing I thought about when I saw these results is, is there a deep Amazon effect here? Because we've all seen it. We all see the Amazon delivery trucks every day. We can hear that weird noise that they all make when they're dropping off their packages. It does make you wonder. What's interesting to me is that FedEx had said in their comments that they had been getting share from say, their primary competitors, and we're not talking about Amazon there. We're talking about, the Postal Service, we're talking about UPS, we're talking about companies like that. There is an argument for that in terms of the ground business, FedEx ground, the operating margins. First of all, the operating income didn't double, but it was up massively from 598 million to about 900 million, and the operating margin went from 7.1% in the year prior, to 10.4% so there is an argument to be made that there might be some consolidation here."", ""It may not just be those weird Amazon delivery trucks. FedEx is actually doing significantly better in its ground business. The hard part is that this is a highly diversified business and international may not be going as well as we'd like to see the express business, it's not clear that that's going nearly as well as they want it to go, but in that core business in the US on the ground, FedEx does have something to build off of here. It's not clear to me whether or not this is a value yet, Dylan, but there is something to build on here and I found that to be interesting, so maybe put this one on your watch list and do a little more research because FedEx is probably not going away. It's still a big cash generator. We still rely on it for logistics around the globe and particularly here in the US, and Amazon does not want to do all of this either. I find it interesting it's getting whacked today, I think for good reason, but there's this small little glimmer of hope, who knew the white FedEx ground trucks? They're still out there."", 'Dylan Lewis: Love it and I love that we are wrapping the show with a stock idea there Tim. I think this might wind up being our final show together for 2023. As we wrap, I just want to thank you for joining me today and joining me throughout the year.', ""Tim Beyers: Thanks lot, Dylan, I appreciate it more caffeine on the way, for me I've only had one cup of coffee today. That is not nearly enough. But merry Christmas and happy holidays you to all of our listeners. Always a pleasure."", ""Dylan Lewis: Thanks, Tim. Our year-ahead outlooks worth investors' attention. Kristy Akullian is a senior member of the Shares investment strategy team at Black Rock. Mary Long caught up with a Cullen for a look at her team's 2024 outlook in one country to keep an eye on."", ""Mary Long: Your team just published a 2024 year ahead outlook we'll chat about that in just a moment. But before we get there, I want to address our audience because the Motley Fool we're about genuinely long term investing buying companies you believe in holding them for a minimum five years. Why should those individual buy and hold long long term investors even worry about the background economic picture at all?"", ""Kristy Akullian: I think that's a great starting point. One of the things that we like to say here is that it's not timing the market, it's time in the market. I think we would completely agree with that stance, that you're investing for the long term, and I think that staying invested and being invested, even when it maybe doesn't feel comfortable, those are our guiding principles too. I think that what you'll see and what comes out in the guide and what we're talking about is actually just that we see a lot of investors holding cash and probably too much cash. A lot of what we write about is really just the importance of stepping out of that and actually investing."", ""Mary Long: To your point, having an idea, even if it's rooted in prediction, having an idea of what to expect in the year ahead can help with that mindset piece, so when things go off the rails, we hope that that doesn't happen, but if that does, we're maybe more mentally and emotionally prepared to see our portfolios reflect that."", 'Kristy Akullian: Exactly.', ""Mary Long: With that, I'll give you the impossible task of predicting the future. [laughs] What does the Crystal Ball have in store for 2024?"", ""Kristy Akullian: Just a level set here too and think about things from the broad macro environment of what we expect to happen, and then translate to what that means for markets as well. At the macro and the economy level, I think that we expect that growth is going to slow down. It's been really stronger than investors and that everybody really anticipated in 2023. We think it's still going to be positive. We're not necessarily saying our base case isn't that we think we're heading into a recession. But that process of going from growing really fast, to growing a bit slower or something more normal that can be painful in and of itself. We want to be a little bit of downside protection in a portfolio. We want to be a little cautious while still remaining invested because we think that that could come. In terms of things like what the Fed is going to do for next year. We do think that we're probably at the end of the Fed's hiking cycle, but we actually don't think that they're going to cut interest rates as much or as soon as the market thinks right now. That could be another cross current at the macro level for investors to think about. Then translating that to what to do in markets is, our Crystal Ball for next year just like staying up in quality. I think that makes sense."", ""Mary Long: I think in the news we've seen more discussion recently about this tension between what data says the economy is like, and then how people feel the economy is like. When you're looking to the year ahead, how much are you weighing those classic economic data points, and are you at all seeking out more anecdotal feelings based stories from consumers and individual investors, people that are active in the economy as opposed to institutions?"", ""Kristy Akullian: Yeah, I think that's exactly right. This year, if you just look at the data of it all, it looks pretty good, and if you go talk to people, it felt pretty bad. I think a really big part of that was inflation, and I think that there is a sense maybe even outside of the investing community, but just like American public, that they feel like inflation falling should mean prices are falling. Of course we know that, that just means they're not going up by as much as they used to. I think that there's a little bit of a dissonance there just in terms of what people are experiencing, and I do think even though it's harder to get exact data on this, this isn't something that is like, perfectly measurable, but I think that there's a transmission mechanism between how people feel, and how the markets react to something. A lot of that can just be chalked up to animal spirits or how much risk appetite people have, and when people feel less wealthy and they feel less confident in the future, they're going to spend less. The risk of the consumer no longer powering the US stock market like it has this year, is one of the risks that we highlight for next year, just in terms of what performance could look like. There is a really real mechanism whereby how you feel about markets actually impacts how they perform."", ""Mary Long: Your outlook talks a lot about the yield curve that changes to it, make cash less appealing, got the shape of that curve. We'll determine what the best will be determined by all these various factors. What's the yield curve? Why should investors pay such close attention to it?"", ""Kristy Akullian: [laughs] I don't think we have said yield curve as much in the last 50 years as we have in the last one. It's such an important thing that we're thinking about. I think it first came into the public, and common conversation, if you will, when it inverted, and that was over a year ago now. What that means is that yields on longer dated bonds were actually lower than yields on shorter dated bonds. If you think about what that does in terms of an incentive structure, it inspires less people to actually invest for the long term, and to actually just play it really safe and do things like hold cash. That point that I started with in terms of the importance of staying in the market, what an inverted yield curve did was it, disincentivized people to do so, and so we still see that the yields on closer to cash or very short dated fixed income exposures are still higher than longer term ones. That to us, looks like something in the economy that isn't functioning exactly as properly. We still think that that needs to return to a normal upward sloping yield curve. Meaning that you get more interest rate or more interest and more yield on those longer dated exposures. We're waiting for that to happen before we think that we're in the all clear. But we do think that now is such an important time to step out of cash because we've seen that start to happen."", 'Mary Long: To step out of cash and into fixed income or other asset classes?', ""Kristy Akullian: I think both. The yield curve in particular though is telling us stepping out of cash and into something like core bonds. In the way that in finance there's so much jargon, they think of this as the intermediate or the belly of the curve if you will. Where we see the most opportunity is in the 3-7 year maturity range, so something like IEI, the iShares 3-7 year Treasury ETF is one that we're talking about a whole bunch with investors right now as an alternative to holding cash."", ""Mary Long: You outlook touches on this. I don't know that they mentioned demographics specifically, but you do talk a lot about international exposure. Which international markets do you have an ion and why?"", ""Kristy Akullian: A big one that started this year and I think can continue is Japan. They're really undergoing a sea change at the macro level. Japan has not had inflation for decades, but they did finally realize some. There have been some important changes to the way that their central bank is reacting to that, and back to the yield curve question, I think that there's some opportunities in Japan that we really haven't seen in multiple decades just because we're starting to see more normalized interest rates there. Inflation can inspire people to go out and actually invest as well. I think that looks relatively positive. One that's specifically on the demographic side is India. Well, we see really strong growth out of India, both as a partner in the front shoring and economic competition way, but also just in terms of how young their population is and how that can continue to drive even more. GDP and broad growth from that country as well. Those are two places we're keeping an eye on for next year and the years ahead."", 'Mary Long: This is perhaps unsurprising, but it sounds like there is a lot all over the world and in many different industries to keep our eyes on in 2024 and ahead. Kristy, thanks so much for the time and all of your insight. We really appreciate it.', 'Kristy Akullian: Awesome.

Therefore, investors should expect yet another dividend increase when the company announces its fourth-quarter results.', ""Chevron (NYSE: CVX) has increased its dividend for 36 straight years, managing through tough economic environments, including the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic before that.

The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$117 and falling to the lows of US$100. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Oracle's current trading price of US$105 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Oracle’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Oracle ', 'According to our valuation model, Oracle seems to be fairly priced at around 3.9% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Oracle today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $109.76, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Oracle’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 53% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Oracle. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? ORCL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ORCL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""If you want to dive deeper into Oracle, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Oracle and you'll want to know about it."", 'If you are no longer interested in Oracle, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.

GPN.', 'Per Mastercard Economics Institute (MEI), the year 2024 will be characterized by easing inflation and a relatively stable labor market fueling consumer spending. As inflation pressure softens across most global economies, consumers will be able to expend more, benefiting companies in the payments space. MEI expects the consumer price index, measuring inflation, to cool down to 4.9% globally in 2024 from 6% in 2023. Although this number will be higher than the pre-pandemic trend of 2.7%, consumer spending should not take a hit as signaled by improved travel-related spending post-pandemic and growth in U.S. retail sales in the 2023 holiday season amid inflationary pressures.', 'Companies in the payments space often resort to mergers and acquisitions strategy, reaping the benefits of diversification. Diversifying around products or geographical markets protects them from resorting to a few selected products or geographies, insulating their top line from unfavorable shocks.

Tap to Pay and virtual cards introduced by the companies should act as a key innovation, enhancing its offerings and providing better security. Per Mastercard, virtual cards should bring in savings of 50 cents to $14 per transaction.', 'Amid the looming tensions in the regulatory environment of reducing swipe fees, companies have held their positions firm. Mastercard believes if the swipe fees are reduced, it will have a negative impact on small businesses and consumers. Companies in the payments space utilize the funds generated from swipe fees to enhance security measures and provide reward programs. Curtailing on such a source of revenue might impact the security of transactions, thereby impacting these companies’ core value proposition.

Doing so before they take off is an entirely different story. However, it's not an impossible task."", ""Three Motley Fool contributors think they've identified stocks that could be monster winners in 2024. Here's why they picked CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MDGL), and Verona Pharma (NASDAQ: VRNA)."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (CRISPR Therapeutics): It's been a great year for the field of gene editing. Several companies that specialize in this area have made important progress. However, the most significant milestone arguably came from CRISPR Therapeutics, which, together with its partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals, earned approval for Casgevy."", ""This treatment for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia (two rare blood diseases) is the first gene-editing therapy on the market that uses the CRISPR technique, which earned its pioneers a Nobel Prize in chemistry. While CRISPR Therapeutics' shares haven't performed particularly well since Casgevy's U.S. approval in early December, next year could be different."", 'CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex are now launching this medicine. With a price tag of $2.2 million in the U.S., its boasts massive, multibillion-dollar potential.', ""It won't happen overnight, though. Gene-editing treatments are challenging to administer, and the process takes some time. However, the two partners will use the next 12 months to set a solid foundation for Casgevy's long-term success."", 'The exercise will include getting third-party payers on board -- something Vertex Pharmaceuticals has plenty of experience with -- and activating authorized treatment centers where the medicine can be safely and effectively administered. In the meantime, CRISPR Therapeutics will make progress on other CRISPR-based gene-editing treatments.', ""With the approval of Casgevy, the company's work no longer looks hypothetical. The rest of CRISPR Therapeutics' lineup uses the same CRISPR gene-editing technique with which Casgevy was developed. For all those reasons, CRISPR Therapeutics could be a major winner in 2024 -- and beyond."", ""Keith Speights (Madrigal Pharmaceuticals): With a market cap hovering around $4.7 billion, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals isn't a monster stock right now. The company's shares fell by a double-digit percentage in 2023 while the overall stock market soared. However, this biotech stock began to bounce back in late October, and I think this rebound could soon gain momentum."", ""I'm not the only one who's bullish about Madrigal. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of over 30%. All three of the analysts surveyed by LSEG\xa0in December who cover Madrigal rated the stock as a buy."", ""There's a simple reason behind this optimism. Madrigal hopes to win U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for resmetirom in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by March 14, 2024. The clinical data for the drug looks solid. Importantly, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for treating NASH, which has quickly become the top cause of liver transplants in the U.S."", 'Madrigal appears to be in a good financial position to fund the potential commercial launch of resmetirom. The company raised $500 million via a public stock offering in October.', 'SVB Financial Group\xa0analysts think that resmetirom can generate peak annual sales of around $2.5 billion. Jefferies Financial Group\xa0projects even higher peak sales of $3 billion. Whatever the actual amount is, Madrigal could soon begin to rake in significant revenue.', ""I look for new CEO Bill Sibold to channel some of its newfound riches into expanding the pipeline. Sibold's experience at Sanofi\xa0should give him a good foundation to lead Madrigal in its next stage of growth."", ""David Jagielski (Verona Pharma): One stock with tremendous potential heading into 2024 is Verona Pharma. It's a risky business to invest in as it doesn't have an approved product, revenue is inconsistent, and it has incurred net losses of just under $51 million over the trailing 12 months."", ""But Verona's financials and its prospects could soon get a big upgrade. That's because the company has a promising treatment in its pipeline for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Ensifentrine is an investigational drug that has demonstrated safety and efficacy in phase 3 trials, showing improvements in lung functions."", ""There are an estimated 380 million patients with COPD, which is the third-leading cause of death worldwide. While there are treatments available in the market, many patients are dissatisfied with the current options, and the majority continue to have symptoms even when they're receiving treatments. Ensifentrine gives patients a new alternative and has scored well in reducing symptoms for patients and improving their quality of life."", 'The FDA is reviewing the drug, with a PDUFA date set for June 26, 2024. If ensifentrine obtains approval, it would be a huge win for Verona. The drug could generate close to $1.5 billion in annual revenue by 2033. Approval could be a game changer for Verona, as it would give it a source of consistent revenue.', ""If you're willing to take a chance on this small biotech stock, the gains could be massive next year. The consensus price target is just under $33, implying a potential upside of close to 60% for investors who buy now. It's admittedly risky, but Verona offers an incredibly promising upside."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

Brookfield Renewable doesn't even need to hit the midpoint of that range to meet our required CAGR. But can the company pull it off? I think so."", ""It's no secret that the demand for renewable energy is soaring. Countries and major corporations have set ambitious carbon reduction targets. More electricity will be needed with the rising adoption of electric vehicles. Brookfield Renewable is ready to help meet that demand with its large and growing development pipeline."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) might seem to be an odd choice for our list. It's already the second-largest company in the world, with a market cap of nearly $2.8 trillion.

And I can sum up my rationale in two words: artificial intelligence (AI).', ""Arguably, no other company is in a better position to profit from the AI boom than Microsoft. The tech giant owns a large stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Microsoft has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 throughout its product lineup. As a major software developer, the company is also poised to benefit from productivity improvement by using AI."", ""Several AI leaders (including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman) predict that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be developed within the next decade. If they're right, any company that is at the forefront of AGI should be wildly attractive to investors. I'd bet that Microsoft will be one of them."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) commands a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). But CF isn't the main reason why investing the final one-third of an initial $300,000 and waiting 10 years can help you retire as a millionaire."", ""This big biotech is rapidly expanding beyond CF. Vertex has already won U.S. approval for Casgevy to treat (and effectively curing) sickle cell disease. It awaits a second approval decision for the gene-editing therapy in treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The consensus projection for Casgevy's peak annual sales is around $2.2 billion, but some analysts think it could make a lot more than that."", ""Vertex has high hopes for its experimental non-opioid pain drug VX-548. The company plans to report results from three late-stage studies in early 2024. It's evaluating inaxaplin in a pivotal clinical study targeting APOL1-mediated kidney disease, which affects more patients than CF. Vertex's pipeline also features multiple programs in early-stage testing that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes."", ""CF will still be important to Vertex's fortunes, though. The biotech is set to soon announce results from late-stage studies of a new triple-drug combo that could be its most powerful and most profitable CF therapy yet."", 'I believe that investing $300,000 spread equally across Brookfield Renewable, Microsoft, and Vertex and waiting a decade truly can help you retire with $1 million. However, there are always risks with investing in stocks that can cause problems.', ""The growth in renewable energy could be slower than many predict and hobble Brookfield Renewable's prospects.

Unfortunately the share price is down 7.4% in the last year."", ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average, also known as Dow Jones or Dow, is one of the oldest and most followed equity indexes of the United States stock market. It was founded more than a century ago in 1896 by Charles Dow, the editor of the Wall Street Journal at the time. Originally, the Dow comprised just twelve companies that were commodity-focused. In 1928, the index was expanded to 30 stocks. It is a price-weighted index, unlike other market indexes which weigh businesses on their market capitalizations of businesses.\xa0', 'In a stock market filled with uncertainty, investments in the Dow are great for stability and defense. However, in a bull market, the Dow cannot always compete with the growth of other indexes that are more tech heavy. For example, so far this year, the market has responded positively to steady interest rates and slowing inflation. The benchmark S&P 500 has returned more than 24% to investors year-to-date. The NASDAQ Composite has outplaced even the S&P 500, returning over 44% to investors. The Dow has returned around 13%.\xa0', 'However, these numbers do not tell the whole story. The Dow has actually shined for value investors over the long term, unlike the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. For example, despite stellar returns in 2023, the S&P 500 is still slightly off the peak it achieved in early 2022. The NASDAQ is actually down by 5%. The Dow sits handsomely above both these indexes with returns of around 3% during this time span. Stocks on the Dow often lag behind the overall market during bull periods but are resilient against sell-offs during recessions.\xa0', 'Some of the top Dow stocks to buy now include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). These firms have established product lines and steady revenues, a quality that all Dow stocks are famous for. Andrew Witty, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), recently highlighted during the third quarter earnings call that the firm was focused on delivering well-balanced and durable growth for investors.\xa0', ""“As a direct result of mission-driven focus, this year, we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022. By the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at Optum Health, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on Optum Rx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third-quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year."", 'The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models. This year, we expect Optum Health will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources and until now, often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need.”', 'Our Methodology', 'These were picked from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and ranked by hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.', 'We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential.

Over the past three months, it has gained 24.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 9.6%. AOS currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Let’s delve into the factors that have been aiding the firm for a while now.Business Strength: A. O. Smith has been benefiting from robust demand for residential water heaters and water treatment products in North America. The company expects water treatment sales in North America to increase 5-7% for 2023. Also, strong demand for commercial water treatment products bodes well for the Rest of the World segment. Within the segment, it expects sales in India to rise 15% year over year in 2023. Driven by strength in its businesses, management raised its 2023 adjusted earnings guidance to $3.70-$3.80 per share from $3.45-$3.60 expected earlier. The figure indicates 19% year-over-year growth at the mid-point.Acquisition Benefits: AOS remains focused on acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines. Its acquisition of Atlantic Filter in June 2022 boosted its position in the water treatment industry and strengthened its customer base in Florida and the adjacent regions.Also, the buyout of Canada-based Giant Factories in October 2021 expanded its commercial and water heater offerings. In 2022, the Giant Factories acquisition added $94 million to its North America sales.Shareholder-Friendly Policies: A. O. Smith remains committed to rewarding its shareholders through dividend payouts and share buybacks. For instance, in the first nine months of 2023, the firm rewarded shareholders with dividends of $135.7 million, reflecting an increase of 3.5% year over year. In the same period, AOS repurchased 2.4 million shares for approximately $161 million. Also, it hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 7% in October 2023.Strong Liquidity Position: The company’s sound liquidity position adds to its strength.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Brad Smith break down the 2024 plans for Starbucks (SBUX), Disney (DIS), and Gap (GPS)."", 'Starbucks has laid out a 3-year plan to unlock $3 billion in efficiencies while also trying to repair partner culture amid unionization efforts.', 'Disney has announced workforce reductions to control costs under returning CEO Bob Iger, who faces activist pressure to invest more in high-potential areas like parks.', 'Gap starts the year with new CEO Richard Dickson at the helm following store closures and sales declines. With a marketing background, Dickson may unveil a restructuring within 6-12 months to catalyze a turnaround.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '[AUDIO LOGO]', 'BRIAN SOZZI: 2023 was the year of change, with companies touting plans to evolve their business for the future.', ""Starbucks announced its triple shot reinvention back in November, as it strives for long-term growth. I guess that's a well named hat tip to the Starbucks marketing department for cooking that one up. But if you go back to this release on what this reinvention plan is, two things stick out to me or really stand out to me that Starbucks has to start delivering on next year, if this stock is going to come off the lows. Really dreadful year for Starbucks investors."", ""One, unlock efficiency. As part of this plan, Starbucks trying to generate $3 billion in savings over 3 years, $2 billion of that outside the store. So things it's doing outside of its own stores that are probably wasteful, make no sense, and should be cut."", 'And then number two, reinvigorate, Brad, the partner culture. And this is really speaking to I think the ongoing union issues that continue to plague Starbucks. I think some folks could easily make the argument they continue to get worse. Bottom line for me is that they are not going anywhere.', ""And like we said yesterday and even earlier in the week, Starbucks has to address this. Get it done and dusted once and for all whatever that might mean, but probably come at the expense of the company's bottom line."", ""BRAD SMITH: So here's some of the benchmarks that you can read Starbucks up against, especially for this reinvention plan-- the triple shot reinvention plan, as you mentioned a moment ago. As the company has set out some of these goals. Growing comps by 5% to 7%, with revenue growth at the low end of the 10% to 12% range. Earnings growth of 15% to 20%. You can grade them on that based on some of the prevailing trends that they set guidance for fiscal 2024."", ""Bottom line here though, you got to think about the international relevance of this brand as well. They're talking within this plan about what's the growth needs to look like both here domestically but as well as internationally and in the core market of China."", ""And so one of the huge things that is important to remember is especially across some of the plays that can be looked at like a Starbucks, where you still need to have a strong corporate and also relationship with the franchisees, the partners as they call them, where those partners might be tough to find, especially in a tough purchasing or tough financing environment like we're in right now. And perhaps that's only going to get more difficult for the company going into next year."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Just give me a cheaper iced coffee, Starbucks.', ""BRAD SMITH: I just want the unicorn frappe to come back. Also, let's talk about a magical place, Disney. Less magical this year. They launched a reinvention plan of its own with Bob Iger back at the helm, starting with job cuts. Those job cuts coming early in the year."", 'This was a way that Bob Iger was trying to signal to the activist campaigns that were coming out of nowhere like Dikembe Mutombo blocking a shot that was unexpected for any basketball players out there. You know the reference. The finger-wagging, the activist campaigns were essentially throwing at Disney as well as the statistics.', ""At the end of the day, that was his own type of efforts to try and say, hey, I've got a handle on costs. I have a handle on getting back to profit. And, oh, yeah, by the way, we might be thinking about a life without ESPN here at Disney. That's still some of the larger questions that lingered."", ""And even after that later on in the year you saw this company hit, what, eight year lows. So a lot of these questions still linger, as well as just I think longer leadership question at the company of who's after Iger at the end of the day because that's still unclear at this point."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: And what do you do with these legacy assets. Now, we're still watching Paramount reportedly shopping itself, whether they go to Warner Brothers Discovery. That is to be determined."", ""But it's one thing for investors to speculate and analysts to speculate, sure, sell off your legacy TV assets like ABC, Disney. But who is buying it? You have to have a willing buyer, and it has to come at a good price. You just don't say, hey, we're going to just unload these assets and they're just going to float out there in the ether sphere."", ""And I just think, Brad, it's going to be hard for Iger to do this because it would be him acknowledging that he didn't see this coming 10 years ago. And he would really I think hurt his legacy if he were to spin off these assets."", ""BRAD SMITH: And at the end of the day too, you've got to think about what they're going to do to continue to invest in some of the businesses that they've signaled that they're going to develop even more on top of, I think most notably at the parks and resorts business. More expansion internationally. More development upon the thousands of acres of land that they've got in Florida that are undeveloped at this point too. So that's more money that's potentially going out the door."", ""But to buy into or to spend into an experience where they're already going to be charging the customer more. And that's another element where the customer is going to have to grapple with how much are we comfortable to pay for those magical passes that allow us to skip the line when we go to Disney World."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: So true. All right. And lastly, and Gap. The company has struggled to connect with consumers, but its new CEO is looking to change that. And, Brad, look, I've been very critical of Gap for going on over 10 years, sales have just been dreadful. Margins dreadful. They've closed hundreds of stores."", ""And it's not just the Gap division. It's been the Old Navy division. The Banana Republic division sometimes call falls into favor with investors. But now the new CEO Richard Dickson, really the guy who saved Mattel now at the helm over at Gap."", ""And I've had the time, I've had a moment to just connect with Richard on just to get a sense of what he might be focusing on for 2024. I do think you will see an investor day from Gap at some point middle of next year, where they try to reset the investor narrative for the company."", ""But as I've learned covering CEOs for a long time, any new CEO is likely within their first 6 to 12 months come out with some form of restructuring plan. I think that is going to be a key initial playbook by Richard, whether it is closing more stores, fine tuning its manufacturing capacity. I do think that plan will hit in the first half of next year."", 'And then secondarily, what Richard does very well is marketing. He is a marketing whiz, but he also, I think he understands the apparel industry, having spent a long time over at Jones Apparel Group. I think he will bring more stylish things that human beings want to actually buy from a Gap and Republic inside of their stores next year. But again, a big turnaround in a tall ask to drive that turnaround over at Gap.', ""BRAD SMITH: Does it mean from your perspective because you've covered this company for a long time. Does it mean that they need to grow up another in-house brand? And I think about what they're doing that started off as a relevance and kind of collaboration partnership with Dapper Dan and starting Gap underneath of Gap and having a few hoodies there. But now they're expanding that into a kid's clothing line. Does it need another kind of reinvigoration of the brand with another subsidy within there?"", 'BRIAN SOZZI: All three a curveball. I think Gap and Richard, they have to go back and consider splitting the company back up now. This is on the table a couple of years ago. Prior management ultimately decided not to do it. I just think it would be more value creating for these brands to trade on their own merit, and ultimately that would drive more focus with each brand. Gap is focused on Gap. Banana is focused on Banana. And Old Navy of course, focused on Old Navy.', ""We also want to talk about one more stock that's striving for its own reinvention plan. That's Beyond Meat. My team letting me mention this yet again. Stock really shot up over 8% about a half an hour ago on our analysis. Of course, we had a really exclusive interview with Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown."", 'Stock pulling back a little bit. But nonetheless, I think Ethan is trying to figure out what gets more people back into the plant-based meat category and something that Peter McGinnis, his counterpart, the CEO of Impossible Foods, is trying to do as well.', ""BRAD SMITH: Got to just ask yourself, has it bottomed out? I mean, this is a company in Beyond Meat that it was really a gauge for another company in Impossible Foods, which at the time was a unicorn. I don't know what their valuation is at this point. It's kind of fallen into obscurity at this juncture."", 'But for Beyond Meat, still the closest thing that anybody in the market has to look at as an alternative meat play that is out there and has its own operations now and that is trying to get more partnerships, both on the wholesale partnership side, going into more of the retail footprints.', ""And then on the restaurant side, trying to drum up even more demand for beyond what beyond bacon, egg, and cheese in the morning or beyond sausage, egg, and cheese. I don't even know if they do bacon yet. But at the end of the day, it's going to require them to get into more meats."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. More meats.', 'BRAD SMITH: More meats.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: It's going to come."", 'BRAD SMITH: More meats for you.']"

Merchandise margin increased 340 bps on 180 bps of leveraged commodity costs and lower air utilization, as well as 160 bps of improved promotional activity from better inventory position and robust assortments. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin increased 290 bps to 6.8%, driven by an improved gross margin and adjusted SG&A leverage. Adjusted SG&A expenses also declined 7% year over year stemming from the organizational changes and other cost-control efforts.Going ahead, management expects the gross margin to expand in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This will be backed by merchandise margin expansion of 280 bps stemming from lower commodity costs and reduced air utilization. It anticipates promotional levels to be roughly in line year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPS’ fiscal 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $1.15, reflecting an increase of 387.5% year over year.

And let's think about those pandemic darlings-- Peloton, Zoom, Moderna, practically the poster child for the pandemic. I mean, they had the first vaccine. This is what we're looking at for some of those stocks this year."", ""And we can see some outperformance by Coinbase, up 404%, Moderna down 44%. So it's a game of have and have nots.

But a lot of these stocks really just a shadow of what they once were."", ""You take a look at Carvana, that's up 1,000% this year. And this is year to date pretty impressive. But when you take a look over the last two years, it is a different story.

And, in fact, over the last two months, some of these stocks have come back pretty strong. Take a look at Coinbase, which is up 151% over the last two months.
