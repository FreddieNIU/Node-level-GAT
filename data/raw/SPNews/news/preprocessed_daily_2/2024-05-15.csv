Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Flowserve has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 20.4X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 17.9X versus its peer group's average of 13.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.28. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', ""We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Flowserve currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates."", 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Flowserve fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Flowserve shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Winners were announced on May 14, highlighting fresh sustainability initiatives, cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) developments, and other creative projects that are helping mold the world. PG&E is one of the first energy companies in North America to deploy standalone power systems as an alternative customer service offering to electricity provided through traditional grid infrastructure. Throughout PG&E’s 70,000-square-mile Northern and Central California service area, pockets of remote customers are served via long electric distribution lines that in many cases traverse high-fire-risk areas. Replacing these overhead powerlines with a reliable and low-carbon local energy source is an innovative option that, in many cases, is preferred for serving customers at the edges of the grid. Remote grids operate independently from the larger electric grid that delivers energy throughout the state, and they allow PG&E to remove overhead powerlines, significantly reducing wildfire risk and service interruptions."", 'This year\'s World Changing Ideas Awards showcase 50 winners, 127 finalists, and 172 honorable mentions—with health, education, energy, and AI among the most popular categories. A panel of Fast Company editors and reporters selected winners from a pool of more than 1,300 entries from across the globe, including the Republic of Korea, Brazil, and Madagascar. ""Recognition of PG&E\'s remote grid program as a Fast Company 2024 World Changing Idea validates our commitment to deploy energy innovations at greater speed and deliver the best possible customer experiences,"" said Mike Delaney, vice president, Utility Partnerships and Innovation, PG&E. ""PG&E is where innovation goes to scale and where innovators come to grow, and I want to thank our program collaborators, our regulators and state agencies, our customers, and our co-workers who made the idea of widely deployed remote grids a reality through breakthrough thinking and swift execution.""

""It\'s endlessly inspiring to see how the world is coming together to devise inventive solutions to our most challenging problems. We need ideas from everywhere, and this year\'s World Changing Ideas Awards are an extraordinary encapsulation of the innovation and creativity that is so abundant around the globe.""', ""PG&E deployed its first remote grid in 2021 in Briceburg, California, near Yosemite National Park. The Briceburg remote grid has been a testament to resilience, maintaining superior power reliability with almost no downtime for the five customers it has served since June 2021. The standalone power system, which replaced 1.3 miles of overhead distribution lines, has generated more than 90% of its power from solar energy. Backup generators support redundancy and power generation during winter months when solar generation is lower due to shorter days and cloudier weather. The Briceburg system has remained operational throughout several severe weather events over the last few years when nearby customers lost power during fires and winter storms. In November 2023, PG&E deployed its fifth—and first fully renewable—remote grid at Pepperwood Preserve outside Santa Rosa, California. The Pepperwood system is comprised of solar and battery energy storage, and includes energy efficiency upgrades to the property it serves to keep from draining the batteries during periods of no or low solar generation, minimizing the likelihood of a power outage. The new system replaces 0.7 miles of overhead distribution line, eliminating the associated wildfire risk, and complementing Pepperwood's own initiatives in wildfire resilience. Today, PG&E celebrates the continued expansion of its remote grid program, with a half dozen new systems being built in 2024, allowing PG&E to remove an additional six miles of overhead power lines while enabling six customers to continue receiving safe, reliable, affordable, low-carbon, and wireless energy. PG&E has worked with Potelco Inc. and Grass Valley, California–based BoxPower to design and build its growing remote grid fleet. Richmond, California–based New Sun Road provides the remote monitoring and control platform for managing PG&E's remote grids. These companies represent a growing ecosystem of microgrid vendors working alongside PG&E to design, deploy, and scale standalone power systems as a service offering. Including the new systems to be deployed in the coming months, PG&E will soon reach up to 12 total remote grids powering 18 customers while removing nearly 13 miles of overhead electric distribution lines at the grid edge in high-fire-threat areas. PG&E has identified many additional locations where remote grids may be the most effective way of reducing wildfire risk and improving electric reliability, with additional sites either in development or being assessed in Butte, Glenn, and Tehama counties, among others. Remote grids are primarily identified, designed, and deployed as part of PG&E's system hardening work, which prioritizes hardening powerlines based on elevated wildfire risk and geographic considerations. In addition to remote grids, PG&E's system hardening efforts include undergrounding, installing stronger and more resilient poles, and replacing bare powerlines with larger, covered lines. —POWER edited this content, which was contributed by a public relations firm representing PG&E.""]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Union Pacific Corporation (UNP), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) and Block, Inc. (SQ). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Union Pacific shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (+25.9% vs. +13.0%), reflecting a reputation for operating excellence and a track record of returning excess to shareholders through buybacks and an attractive dividend. The company bought back $0.7 billion worth of its won shares and paid dividends worth $3.2 billion in 2023.Union Pacific's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. On the flip side, a decline in volumes due to soft consumer markets and reduced fuel surcharge revenues is a concern. Volumes declined 1% year over year in 2023.Given the soft freight market scenario, the revenue weakness is likely to persist going forward as well. This will hurt overall volumes. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated 220 basis points in 2023 from the 2022 reading, mainly due to revenue weakness. Capital expenditures are expected to be $3.4 billion in 2024.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>>)Shares of Freeport-McMoRan have gained +46.1% over the past year against the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry’s gain of +54.7%. The company is conducting exploration activities near existing mines to expand reserves. It is expected to gain from progress in exploration activities that will boost production capacity.Freeport-McMoRan is executing a number of smelter projects in Indonesia. Freeport’s Lone Star project also provides additional upside. It is well-positioned to benefit from automotive electrification, which is a positive for copper as electric vehicles are copper-intensive. The company's efforts to reduce debt is also encouraging.However, it faces headwinds from higher labor, energy and services costs. Weak copper volumes may also hurt performance in 2024. Sizable capital spending is likely to impact free cash flow generation.(You can read the full research report on Freeport-McMoRan here >>>)Block shares have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the year-to-date period (-9.8% vs. +13.0%). The company’s strength across Square and Cash App ecosystem contributed well. Strong growth in transaction and subscription revenues drove the results further. Robust performance of the company’s ‘buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) platform remained positive.Also, growing GPV owing to Square ecosystem momentum was another positive. Improvement in the card-present volumes remained a tailwind. Also, rising card-not-present GPV owing to robust online channels contributed well.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate."", 'Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Marathon Oil basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Marathon Oil imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 9.2%.', 'Bottom Line', ""Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term."", 'You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>', 'The upgrade of Marathon Oil to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It's up 160% in 2024 so far, which means Nvidia has more than doubled its money since buying it in the fourth quarter of last year."", ""At SoundHound's current stock price of $5.50, Nvidia's position is worth around $9 million. While that doesn't sound like a big number, SoundHound is only a $1.8 billion company. But it's packed with potential, so should investors follow Nvidia's lead?"", 'AI went mainstream in 2023 with applications like ChatGPT, which allowed users to enter text-based prompts to instantly generate text, images, videos, and computer code. SoundHound specializes in conversational AI, which uses voice recognition to create a number of useful business applications.', ""Restaurant chains like Applebee's, Chipotle, and Krispy Kreme use its technology to take customer orders in-store, over the phone, and in the drive-thru at a growing number of their locations, which reduces the workload on employees."", ""And SoundHound's Employee Assist tool allows workers to hold conversations with an AI virtual assistant, which is available to answer questions at a moment's notice whether it relates to in-store policies or instructions for making menu items."", ""The company's technology is also powering the voice assistants in a growing number of new cars, from manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Stellantis (which owns Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge). The Vehicle Intelligence application can walk drivers through their car's features, and the Chat AI application can answer general questions about the weather, sports scores, and nearby attractions."", ""SoundHound also has a deal with Nvidia Drive, which is an end-to-end autonomous vehicle platform for car manufacturers. Nvidia is using SoundHound to create a powerful voice assistant that doesn't require internet connectivity, making it far more private because data isn't exposed externally."", ""SoundHound AI generated $11.6 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), and while that's a relatively small number, it was a 73% increase from the year-ago period."", 'The company also issued a modest increase to its forecast for the full year, and it now expects to deliver a record-high $71 million in total revenue. That would represent year-over-year growth of 55%, an acceleration from the 47% growth it delivered in 2023.', 'It also shored up its long-term revenue-earning potential, with an order backlog worth $682 million at the end of the first quarter -- an 80% increase from the year-ago period. This backlog is expected to convert into revenue over a period of seven years, on average, and in as little as four years for some subscription-based customers.', ""However, Chief Financial Officer Nitesh Sharan says the backlog figure only factors in deals that have a reasonable chance to convert into revenue based on the facts at hand today, and not the potential opportunities in the pipeline. For example, he recently told investors the company has over 100,000 store locations in its sales pipeline, which aren't in the backlog data."", 'While this growth is impressive, the company is in the scale-up phase, which requires significant capital investment. As a result, it lost over $33 million at the bottom line in the first quarter. That was 20% larger than its loss from the same quarter last year, despite generating significantly more revenue now.', ""SoundHound only had $226 million in cash on hand at the end of the quarter, so it can't sustain its growing losses indefinitely. It entered a new at-the-market facility during that period, which will allow management to sell new shares to investors to raise money when appropriate. But only time will tell whether that will be enough to see the company through to profitability."", 'On a positive note, management believes it could generate a profit during 2025 on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). However, that is far from a sure thing, and in my opinion, investors are paying a hefty price relative to the risk at hand.', ""Based on the company's $50.8 million in trailing 12-month revenue and its market cap of $1.8 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 35. By comparison, Nvidia trades at a P/S of 36, but it's growing its revenue even more quickly than SoundHound, and the company is highly profitable. Microsoft, which is a leader in AI software, trades at a P/S of just 13.6."", ""So, should investors buy SoundHoundAI just because Nvidia did? At the current price, it's a tough recommendation. Besides, Nvidia's stake is only worth $9 million -- if it went to zero, the $2.2 trillion chip giant wouldn't even flinch."", 'Therefore, buying the stock should be reserved for investors with a very high risk tolerance.

Duolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL) is one of them. It operates the world's largest digital language education platform, and it's finding unique ways to apply AI to enhance the learning experience and reduce the workload on its employees."", ""Duolingo is generating incredible amounts of growth, yet it has barely scratched the surface of its addressable market. Here's why investors who are sitting on idle cash (money they don't need for immediate expenses) might want to put $200 toward one share of Duolingo."", ""Technology is Duolingo's secret sauce. It has pulled language education out of the classroom and placed it at the fingertips of its 97.6 million monthly active users anywhere, anytime via their smartphones. But it doesn't stop there, because Duolingo's gamified and interactive user experience ensures learners remain engaged with their lessons."", ""In fact, during the first quarter of 2024, 31.4 million of Duolingo's monthly users signed in every single day, and that ratio (32%) was the highest in the platform's history. The company also had a record-high 7.4 million paying subscribers during Q1, which was a 54% increase from the year-ago period."", ""AI is playing a growing role in converting the platform's free users into paid users. Last year, Duolingo launched a new subscription tier called Max, which includes two generative AI features designed to accelerate the learning process. One of them is called Roleplay, which is an AI chatbot that helps the user practice their conversational skills in a language of their choice. The other feature is Explain My Answer, which gives each Max subscriber personalized feedback on their mistakes in each lesson."", ""Duolingo's long-term goal is to deliver an educational experience equivalent to that of a private tutor, and AI is a substantial leap toward that target. The company has been developing its own models since 2013, but it also has a partnership with OpenAI that is accelerating its progress."", 'Duolingo is also using AI behind the scenes to craft lesson content, which allows employees to focus on more critical tasks. Plus, AI is applied extensively to the Duolingo English Test (DET), which is an accredited test used for things like university admissions. AI helps create, administer, grade, and even secure the DET, which enables the company to deliver results more quickly and keep costs down for each participant.', ""Duolingo generated $167.6 million in revenue during Q1, which was a 45% increase from the year-ago period, and above the high end of the company's forecast ($167 million)."", 'The strong result prompted management to increase its full-year guidance for 2024. It now expects to deliver a record-high $731 million in revenue (at the midpoint of the range) for the year compared to its previous forecast of $723.5 million.', ""Many U.S. companies have recently warned of a slowdown in consumer spending on the back of challenging economic conditions led by high interest rates, so Duolingo's decision to raise investors' expectations is very telling of the strength of its business."", 'But it gets better, because Duolingo managed to deliver a profit to accompany its strong revenue growth. The company reported $26.9 million in net income during Q1, which was a big positive swing from the $2.5 million net loss it posted in the year-ago period.', 'Duolingo also likes to focus on a non-GAAP profitability measure called adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), which strips out one-off and non-cash expenses like stock-based compensation. That metric came in at $44 million during Q1, which was a whopping 191% increase year over year.', ""For all of Duolingo's success to date, it has only scratched the surface of its opportunity. CEO Luis von Anh says the addressable market for language learning could be worth $115 billion in 2025, so based on the company's revenue forecast for this year, it isn't even capturing 1% of that right now. That means Duolingo could have a very long runway for growth."", 'Plus, the company has a unique business model that should insulate it if a slowdown in the broader economy does gather momentum. It previously told investors that 90% of its user acquisition is completely organic (in other words, it costs nothing), which is why it managed to grow so quickly despite only spending $19.9 million on marketing during Q1 (or just 12% of revenue).', ""Simply put, Duolingo has a solid product that does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to attracting users. Theoretically, the company could have doubled its marketing spending during Q1 and still generated a profit, which is like having an ace in the hole should the platform ever need to reignite growth. I know a few consumer technology companies that would be envious of Duolingo's position."", 'As a result, not only is Duolingo a great buy for its incredible growth and its unique application of AI technologies, but the stock might also be a smart place to park some money if economic conditions deteriorate.', 'Before you buy stock in Duolingo, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Duolingo wasn’t one of them.

Since the green flag waved at the start of 2023, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-centric Nasdaq Composite have respectively rallied by 19%, 36%, and 56%, as well as hit fresh all-time highs."", 'While certain sectors and industries have played a role in pushing the broader market higher, the ""Magnificent Seven"" are attributed with putting the weight of Wall Street on their proverbial backs and lifting the stock market to new heights.', 'The Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', 'Aside from each of these businesses handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, they provide well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright moats within their respective industries.', ""For example, Alphabet's Google accounts for nearly 91% of worldwide internet search share, while Amazon's e-commerce marketplace oversaw close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are also the respective No.'s 1, 2, and 3 in cloud infrastructure service market share by enterprise spend."", 'Despite the clear-cut catalysts the Magnificent Seven stocks bring to the table, not all Wall Street analysts share an optimistic view for their future. Based on bottom of the barrel price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, the following three Magnificent Seven components could plunge by up to 86%.', 'The first Magnificent Seven constituent that at least one analyst believes could meaningfully decline in the not-too-distant future is social media colossus Meta Platforms.', ""Earlier this month, BNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinski, who often takes a contrarian view on some of Wall Street's leading businesses, set a price target of just $360 on shares of Meta. This suggests 24% downside to come, based on the $476.20-per-share closing price, as of May 10."", ""According to Slowinski, Meta lacks new revenue streams, when compared to the other companies spending big on artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. This lack of new revenue channels, coupled with the company's forecast of higher capital expenditures tied to AI, have Slowinski believing Meta could underperform."", 'On the other hand, Meta is the undisputed leader among social media platforms. It owns the top social media ""real estate"" globally, including the most-visited social site (Facebook), and lured 3.24 billion users to its family of apps on a daily basis during the quarter ended in March. Businesses understand they\'re not going to reach a broader set of eyeballs on any other social media platform, which tends to afford Meta exceptionally strong ad pricing power.', 'Meta Platforms also benefits from lengthy periods of economic expansion. Since it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising, the company would be vulnerable to a recession. At the moment, a few key indicators, including a historic drop in U.S. M2 money supply, do suggest an economic downturn is probable.', 'However, recessions are short-lived. All 12 U.S. recessions since 1945 have endured between two and 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth last for multiple years, and occasionally even stick around for a decade. Ad-driven businesses thrive during these long-winded expansions.', ""A final reason Slowinski may be forced to eat his words is Meta's balance sheet. The company closed out March with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated north of $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations through the first three months of 2024. In other words, it has the capital to take risks and aggressively invest in its future -- even if the payoff from those investments are a few years away from being truly material to its top and bottom line."", 'The second Magnificent Seven member that one Wall Street analyst views as anything but ""magnificent"" is semiconductor behemoth Nvidia.', ""Based on a February note issued by analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson, there's concern about demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerating graphics processing units (GPUs) peaking in the current year. With the prospect of slower growth on the horizon, Luria's low-water price target of $620 implies a decline of 31% for Nvidia's stock over the coming year."", ""On the bright side, Nvidia's GPUs have come to dominate AI-accelerated data centers. With demand handily outpacing supply, strong pricing power helped to more than triple Data Center segment sales in fiscal 2024 (ended January 28)."", ""But Luria hit the nail on the head when it comes to competition. While most folks might be focused on external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which are both rolling out AI-accelerators for enterprise data centers, it's internal competition from Nvidia's top customers that's the far bigger concern."", ""Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four-largest customers and comprise in the neighborhood of 40% of its net sales. But these four giants are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if this is purely for complementary purposes, demand for Nvidia's high-powered chips would likely wane after the current fiscal year."", ""What's more, there hasn't been a next-big-thing investment or innovation over the last three decades that didn't navigate its way through a bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors overestimate the uptake or adoption of new technologies. Since no company has benefited more from the rise of AI, Nvidia would, in theory, be hit the hardest if the AI bubble bursts."", ""Luria's price target on Nvidia is likely to be reached."", 'But the disaster du jour among Magnificent Seven stocks, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street pundit, is electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla. Gordon Johnson, the CEO and founder of GLJ Research and longtime Tesla bear, believes shares will reach $23.53.', ""This weirdly specific price target was arrived at by applying a multiple of 15 times Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) in 2025 and working backwards using a 9% discount rate. Keep in mind this price target was issued earlier this year, and Tesla's consensus EPS for 2025 has declined since then. If Johnson's price target were to prove accurate, shares of Tesla would implode by 86% from where they closed on May 10."", ""Tesla has made a habit of proving skeptics wrong. For instance, it's the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit. Tesla recently introduced its fifth mass-production model (Cybertruck) and has the capacity to roll out more than 2 million EVs annually."", ""However, headwinds are most definitely mounting for North America's leading EV company."", ""As an example, increasing EV and hybrid competition has coerced Tesla to slash the sales price of its primary production models (3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. CEO Elon Musk has been clear that his company's price strategy is entirely based on demand. But even with these aggressive cuts, Tesla's inventory levels have soared and its operating margins are tumbling."", ""Tesla's efforts to transform into more than just a car company haven't gone swimmingly, either. Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has slowed dramatically, while Services segment gross margin is consistently in the low-to-mid single digits. Meanwhile, more than half of the company's pre-tax income during the March-ended quarter came from unsustainable sources (e.g., interest income and the sale of regulatory tax credits)."", ""The final nail in the coffin is that Musk has proved to be a tangible liability for the company. Many of Musk's promises, such as Level 5 autonomy and robotaxis, which are already baked into Tesla's valuation, have failed to come to fruition. The longer these claims go unfulfilled, the likelier it is that Tesla's massive valuation premium to other auto stocks will deflate."", 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

High fuel costs due to an escalation in oil prices are a bane and are likely to hurt Southwest Airlines' bottom line. As fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any airline player, the uptick in these costs naturally does not bode well."", 'The northward movement in crude prices is primarily due to the ongoing production cut by major oil-producing nations and geopolitical tensions.

Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Specifically, we decided to study Southwest Airlines'  ROE in this article."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Southwest Airlines is:', '3.9% = US$393m ÷ US$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""It is quite clear that Southwest Airlines' ROE is rather low. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 9.5%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. For this reason, Southwest Airlines' five year net income decline of 15% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""However, when we compared Southwest Airlines' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 4.6% in the same period. This is quite worrisome."", 'Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Southwest Airlines is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.', ""In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 32% (that is, a retention ratio of 68%), the fact that Southwest Airlines' earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds."", ""Additionally, Southwest Airlines has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 31%. Still, forecasts suggest that Southwest Airlines' future ROE will rise to 12% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much."", ""Overall, we have mixed feelings about Southwest Airlines. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth.

In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at TransDigm Group (TDG), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. TransDigm Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for TDG that show why this aircraft components maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick."", ""Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For TDG, shares are up 1.29% over the past week while the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry is up 2.21% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.05% compares favorably with the industry's 8.48% performance as well."", 'Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of TransDigm Group have risen 11.7%, and are up 58.46% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.76% and 28.32%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to TDG's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. TDG is currently averaging 219,980 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes.

In the first quarter, Augmedix grew revenue by 40%, generated an NRR of 143% and achieved higher gross margins. Financially, our quarterly performance was solid and in line across the board. There was also a quarter full of activity across the organization as we introduced our AI products and scaled our organization to aggressively pursue the growing opportunity in front of us.There were several observations, worthy, that occurred during the first quarter. First, we have made Augmedix Go generally available in both the ambulatory setting and emergency department, making us the industry's only provider that offers fully automated, generative AI-powered medical documentation product in both care settings.Augmedix Go ED, in particular, has really resonated with health systems. It is opening doors for us, and we are encouraged by the early feedback and interest. Second, for Augmedix Go in the clinical setting, we are participating in a growing number of large pilots. Third, we further broadened our product portfolio with the launch of a premium generative AI product called Augmedix Go Assist.At the discretion of the clinician, the draft note is simultaneously delivered to an Augmedix medical documentation specialist, [to reduce] for quality assurance, and make any necessary edits before clinician sign-off. Augmedix Go Assist is already generating strong, early interest from customers due to its attractive mix of price and efficiency.Four, we have been, and continue to work side-by-side, with our strategic partner, HCA Healthcare, to calibrate and optimize our AI products. Our pilot program with HCA Healthcare has gone well. They are now readying for a wide deployment of Augmedix Go across their emergency department. We expect this to be meaningful to our revenue growth.Finally, we are well underway, with putting the proceeds of our November 2023 capital raise to work by expanding our commercial and technical teams. We have completed approximately 6% of the hiring plan we put together before the November 2023 raise, and expect to be substantially complete by the end of summer.As I look at what we are doing in the industry around us, it is clear that we are generating an increasing amount of interest with new and existing customers who are evaluating our product. Our previously announced Go pilot with a Fortune 100 healthcare company is progressing well. We have another Go pilot with a second Fortune 100 company that is also progressing well, and so are additional conversations with that company that could lead to a deeper partnership.And we just launched Augmedix Go Assist and it has garnered significant attention and we are already piloting it with three of our largest clients. At the same time, it is clear that healthcare organizations are proceeding methodically, as they evaluate a number of AI options across the industry.These range from fully automated AI [on a] solutions for many encounters, to less automated, higher cost solutions with trained personnel involved to deliver a more accurate medical note, and ancillary services that further de-burden clinicians for an important subset of encounters.The organizations are prioritizing these evaluations while trying to strike the right balance of low cost automation and higher-quality offerings. The upside is market adoption is growing at a faster rate than we anticipated.As the industry is deeply engaged in its evaluation of new documentation solutions, since the last earnings call, we have observed an increase in interest broadly in the market, but a slowdown in the purchase purchasing commitments of established solutions such as our Live product.Accordingly, we are adjusting our full-year revenue outlook. I would like to address some developments over the last months that have led us to this decision. We are continuing to sell cohorts of new live users, although not at the level that we had previously expected, as a few health systems have slowed down their expansion with us as they evaluate AI products.Importantly, we still have numerous clients adding Live users, as evidenced by our high NRR, just not that prior levels we have seen in recent quarters.Secondly, a couple of our larger health systems have chosen to transition some of their Augmedix Live users to the lower price Go Assist product. It's a clear indication that Go Assist is resonating with existing customers, and bolsters our confidence that it will help us grow our ARR with customers over time.But near term, it results in lower current year revenue expectation at these accounts. Vendors that are AI only, or those who are built on human intervention only, will suffer as customers want a variety of options to meet them where they are today, and where they want to be in the future. We have products that address their current needs as well as what they anticipate over the next few years.Finally, as large organizations carefully evaluate their options, revenue scale-ups are being extended, as large organizations transition from pilots to wider and longer-term commercial deployment. This has been factored into our guidance.The net result of these developments is that we are booking a higher percentage of our revenue from AI-based products, which carries lower ARPU, but a higher gross margin, in our established product.Our company's transition from a tech-enabled service company to a SaaS AI first company with human co-pilot is coming even faster, which we believe will ultimately deliver higher value for our shareholders.Despite the reduction in our revenue growth trajectory for 2024 relative to our prior expectations, I am as confident about Augmedix's prospects as ever.We offer health systems the most comprehensive portfolio of documentation product in the industry. Our products are based on over 10 million patient encounters that we have documented for some of the largest healthcare systems in the country, including HCA and Common Spirit, which leveraged the latest AI technology we have developed in-house and with partners such as Google.Our marketing experience is a powerful, durable advantage, compared to single-point solution new entrants, creating a robust moat around our business. Our broad based offerings give our customers unrivaled flexibility and value.Customers of Augmedix can choose the right option for the encounter, or the doctor, or the studying. They can toggle between offerings on the fly. For routine patient encounters, Augmedix Go, our fully automated AI documentation solution, would be the right choice.For more complicated encounters or if the clinician is pressed for time and prefers not to interact with the EHR, Augmedix Go Assist activates the documentation specialists to review the note for quality assurance, and make any necessary edits before clinician sign-offs.But for more complex encounters, and/or need for additional services, Augmedix Live ensures the most accurate note, and provides access to a virtual extension of the clinicians' care team.Our competitors cannot match this capability, and we are convinced we will ultimately emerge as one of the industry's winners because of it. We expect to see customers move beyond the decision to use a one-size fits all documentation solution, and instead focus on a portfolio of documentation products, that optimally fits each workflow care setting and encounter.Augmedix is perfectly positioned to address this shift. Generative AI tools are capable of doing much of the heavy lifting when it comes to medical note documentation. That's why we're harnessing AI in our solution. However, generative AI in isolation is not sufficient to produce accurate and comprehensive medical notes consistently in many specialties and patient encounters.We have already seen frustration with AI-only solutions, and that generates opportunity for us as customers will need to find the right balance of automation and human intervention. Augmedix built an unrivaled repository of domain knowledge, over the last 11 years related to clinician workflows and medical datasets.This knowledge has enabled us to address multiple care settings, serve more than 50 specialties, provide clinical decision support to the point of care at the right moment, and deliver structured data that positively impact customers' operational efficiency as well as downstream activities, such as billing.These key points of differentiation provide a significant moat around our business. The recent industry events have reinforced my confidence in augmented. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul Ginocchio, our Chief Financial Officer. Then I'll return with closing comments. Paul?"", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Thank you, Manny. Let's review the quarter's financial highlights. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $13.5 million, up 40% from the $9.6 million in the first quarter of last year. Growth was driven by the adoption of Live and Notes by existing customers.Gross margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 47.1% as compared to 45.6% in the first quarter of 2023, and 49.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This 150 basis point improvement year on year in gross margin percentage, was mainly driven by our growing scale and efficiency, and also by our strategic initiative to ship US service clinicians to outside the US.The sequential decline was due to temporary costs that we incurred in our overseas operations related to the move to a new building in Bangladesh, and a onetime optimization initiative in India. Although the impact to gross margin in the quarter was slightly less than we had anticipated, we expect gross margins to be closer to fully recovered in May.Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2024 were $12.7 million, up $2.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. As we talked about in the November 2023 capital raise, we're going to add approximately $9 million to annual expense on top of the previous plan, largely concentrated in additional sales and engineering talent, and we are executing on that plan. In fact, we're roughly 60% complete with our hiring plan.In terms of profitability, our loss from operations increased to $6.4 million from $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the additional hires post the November capital raise. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a loss of $4.3 million.Cash flow from operating activities was an outflow of $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to an outflow of $6.2 million in the first quarter of last year. As of March 31, 2024, we had $37.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $46.2 million as of December 31, 2023.Our weighted average share count for EPS for the first quarter was 53.1 million common shares and prefunded warrants outstanding. Assuming all other warrants outstanding our net exercise in all our employee options and [SARS] are fully vested in the money. Our net exercised we would have approximately 56.0 million shares outstanding currently.Now moving on to guidance, which is based on our current expectations and reflective of the factors arising after the last earnings call that Manny described earlier. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be up slightly sequentially from the first quarter, as customer expansions are being offset by the product mix changes Manny spoke about earlier.We expect GAAP gross margins to increase from the first quarter of 2024 by 50 basis points to 100 basis points. For the full year of 2024, we expect to generate approximately $52 million to $55 million of revenue. This compares to our prior expectation of $60 million to $62 million. The change in full year revenue guidance, which is $7.5 million at the midpoint, is primarily a result of two developments that we observed following our last earnings call -- lower expectations for Live bookings, and current Live users moving to Augmenix Go Assist.As Go and Go Assist recently launched, their ramp up is still in the early stages to offset the impact of these two factors. As we have previously stated, we anticipate Go revenue to be modest during the first half of 2024. We do expect Go to have a positive contribution later in the year and then contribute more materially in 2025.Approximately 80% of our change to our revenue guidance relates to Augmedix Live. We now expect to exit 2024 with a higher percentage of our revenue related to our AI products, Augmedix Go and Augmedix Go Assist, than our previous expectations.We continue to anticipate total GAAP operating expenses to be in the mid to upper $50 million range in 2024. We still expect to exit 2025 at operating cash flow breakeven before net interest expense, and we have sufficient runway to get there. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back to Manny for closing comments."", 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Thank you Paul. Our industry is in the process of adopting new technology -- generative AI at an unprecedented pace. This is a reversal of the healthcare industry's history of latent technology adoption. The pendulum has certainly swung to the other extreme. We welcome this change, as it will accelerate the proliferation of solutions such as those offered by Augmedix.In their hot pursuit of generative AI solutions, we believe many healthcare systems will discover a disparity between the promise of gen AI, and it's actual performance for a meaningful portion of patient encounters.For this reason, we offer a range of products that meet customers where they are today, and where they want to be tomorrow. I am confident of our market positioning and look forward to continued progress in our push to lead this market.I appreciate the dedication of our team, and the support received from our customers and shareholders. Thank you. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Ryan Daniels, William Blair.', 'Ryan Daniels', 'Yes, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Paul, first, a quick clarification for you. You mentioned 85% of the roughly 12% guidance reduction in sales is due to Augmedix Live. Is that the movement from Live to Go, or is it just lower bookings? I just want to make sure I fully understand that.', 'Paul Ginocchio', 'Yes. 80% of that change is due to both lower bookings, and the move from Live to Go Assist. Those two account for the 80%.', 'Ryan Daniels', ""And then what's the remainder, I guess, if the two things you called out are kind of the majority of it, what else is there that's bringing the guidance down?"", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""We're also now assuming a faster migration of Notes, which is the sort of more established product, to Go Assist. In that price point, that ARPU is lower, and so that's the remaining 20%."", 'Ryan Daniels', ""Got it. I just want to make sure. And then can you talk a little bit about how quickly clients can make that conversion? So I'm curious if it is something that comes up upon renewal, or if it's monthly, or if you just allow them to kind of move that ad hoc. So what kind of visibility you have on that potential transition?"", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Sure. It depends on the contract. For the vast majority of the contracts, they have a 90 day ability to make that migration. And of course, we're going to do what's right for the customer and maximize their ROI, and not try to optimize our revenue near term with the client.We're going to optimize the ROI for the customer long term because we want to obviously make keep customers happy and do what's right for them. So we're trying to obviously do what's right for the customer. So we have a sort of 90 day visibility on a migration from Live to Go Assist."", 'Ryan Daniels', 'Okay. Great.', 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""And then I just add to that -- sorry, Ryan -- from Notes to Go Assist as well. There's a couple of transitions."", 'Ryan Daniels', ""Okay. And then, how are you thinking about the cash burn and investments? It sounds like you're not making any changes to that despite the headwinds you're seeing here that were unexpected. So I think one of the questions will just be related to the cash burn, related to the investments you're making in the market, and your conviction in your ability to get to that cash flow breakeven number. So can you dive a little bit deeper on all those elements for us?"", 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""That's a good question, Ryan. So right now, as we both pointed out, during the prepared remarks, we've completed about 60% of the hiring that we had planned to complete, and we're going to calibrate very carefully with the rest of those those potential hires in relation to how the market reacts to our product offering, and the pace at which they adopt the new products.So we're not going to be blind to this. We're not going to be -- we're not going to be dogmatic about our previous hiring plan, and we'll make whatever adjustments are necessary as warranted by market conditions."", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""And Ryan, we did say mid-50s to high-50s. So hat range gives us some wiggle room to begin with and then obviously, we'll make adjustments as needed."", 'Ryan Daniels', ""Okay, great. I'll quit hogging the call, and hop back in the queue. Thanks."", 'Operator', 'Elizabeth Anderson, Evercore ISI.', 'Elizabeth Anderson', ""Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on decision delays, or maybe it's too soon, or you see it go for typical like length? Is there a certain win rate or you think we're sort of too soon in this process to really have good visibility on that right now?"", 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Hey, Elizabeth. Good question. I think there's a couple of factors going on here. I think there's been a rush to try AI solutions from a variety of providers. As you probably know, there are 42 companies in this space right now that are offering generated a high medical documentation solutions. So there's a lot of noise in the market and a lot of trials that are ongoing.And I think until those trials kind of run their course, providers are going to be somewhat reluctant to commit wide-scale to any one particular solution or vendor. It would be kind of risky to do that in my view, and based on discussions I've had with some customers to commit at this early stage.So we're in a period of trial and the vendors are trying to demonstrate their capabilities and prove that they can deliver on the promise of those product offerings, and providers are going to be evaluating them. And until they complete that evaluation, I don't expect that there's going to be massive, large adoptions of any particular solution."", 'Elizabeth Anderson', ""Okay. That's helpful. And maybe come to over to sort of like a relative bright spot -- a nice bright spot in the quarter -- the HCA ramp. How are you guys thinking about that as it goes? Is it kind of like ratably across the year? Are there certain ways that we should consider as we're thinking about that contract starting off?"", 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Well, the plan was, and still is, to deploy the ED solution, Go ED, across their entire enterprise. I think it's roughly 184 hospitals. So that's the plan. The pace at which is going to depend on a few things.One, of course, is when they greenlight it to start the mass adoption. Part of that is dependent on them to make sure they've got the right change management programs in place at each hospital, to accept this, and the other factor is their transition from Meditech Magic EHR to expand.And that's something that will likely have an impact on our pace of deployment within HCA's ER departments. We don't have a great deal of visibility on how quickly expansion is going to be deployed across those 184 hospitals. I know that HCA wants to have it happen as soon as possible, but they're not in complete control over that. Meditech has a lot to do with it.And my sense is that right now, the target is to have that happen sometime in the fall. But again, I don't have precise details on when exactly which hospitals are going to be deployed -- are going to be transitioned from Magic to expand."", 'Elizabeth Anderson', ""Got it. That's helpful. And maybe one last one for me. In terms of the 2026 EBITDA numbers, are expectation still similar given what you're saying, but the OpEx are you sort of less or no?"", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Hey Elizabeth, it's Paul. 2026 EBITDA number? I didn't quite understand that."", 'Elizabeth Anderson', 'Yes, like in terms of having that be profitable in 2026, is that still sort of on the table, or are you saying not at this point?', 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Sure.

Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Brooks O’Neil, Lake Street Capital Markets.', 'Aaron Wukmir', ""Hey, guys. This is Aaron on the line for Brooks this afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions. I'm curious on now that Go Assist has been launched. You know, you've had some commentary, but how do you sort of see the customer adoption sort of developing during the remainder of the year here?"", 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Well we've gotten some really strong requests from some of our bigger customers for the product. So we feel pretty good about its prospects, and these inbounds are coming from some of our biggest customers. So we're very encouraged by the initial signals we're getting from the market for that particular product.And I think it's in reaction to expectations that were set perhaps unrealistically high for the pure AI products that are being offered by some of our competitorsm and so we feel that we're very well positioned to take advantage of that disparity between those expectations and reality."", 'Paul Ginocchio', 'Hey Aaron, the great thing about customer interest in Augmedix Go and Augmedix Go Assist is it just opens up a much wider segment of their physician population than we had access to before, and that allows us deeper penetration, and obviously, ultimately better revenue over time.', 'Aaron Wukmir', ""Great. No, absolutely. That's very helpful. And then just kind of wondering, sort of your engagement. What does that sort of look like with with other large health systems around the US, and I guess how significant has that changed? And in particular with Go, but also your other key products as well?"", 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Well, as I mentioned before during a prior question, there are 42 companies that are in this space now. So there's a lot of noise in the marketplace, and our job is to make sure that our voice is heard above all the clutter.What we have going for us, of course, is 11 years of experience in this sector, more than anybody else. And we've got relationships with 5 of the top 5 of the 10 largest health care systems in the US. So we have a good presence. People know about us. We have credibility with partners like Google and HCA as opposed to the vast majority of these other companies that are trying to get into this space.So that's helped us kind of rise above the clutter, and we're getting good at that, I'd say, today relative to where the situation might have been six months ago on these are early pilots."", 'Aaron Wukmir', ""Great. No, that's helpful. Thank you, Manny."", 'Operator', 'Yuan Zhi, B. Riley Securities.', 'Yuan Zhi', ""Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our questions. Manny, we've heard there are some new AI laws introduced to Connecticut and the Utah. Can you help us understand the impact of these AI laws on adoption Augmedix services? And do they have different degrees of impact on Augmedix Live and Augmedix Go, if you have the clients in that state?"", 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Hey, Yuan. Thank you. That's a good question. Yes, we are familiar with the initial raft of regulations that are coming out, and it's important to draw the distinction between what we do, which is provide clinical decision support, from what the regulations are trying to cover, which is clinical decision making.So we are not classified as a clinical or medical device, which would fall under those regulations. We provide support in the form of information, to help clinicians make decisions. That's a very important distinction that we adhere to in a very disciplined fashion so that we do not fall into those regulations."", 'Yuan Zhi', 'Got it. And maybe a clarification here. So how long does it take for customers to evaluate these medical documentation services? You may have touched on this, but what has changed in the last three months that caused them to look into other offerings at the same time?', 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Well, it's a good question, and it varies, as you can imagine, across the board. It depends on how centralized the decision-making is within a particular enterprise. Some healthcare prices are very centralized, others are very decentralized. And so there's many points of decision making that occur in these decentralized organizations.And you could have situations where, and I think this is going to be representative of the market going forward, where you'll have multiple vendors within the same large enterprise. That will not be unusual, especially considering the fact that virtually everybody in our space is a single-point solution provider with the exception of Augmedix.So to the extent an enterprise requires more than one type of solution, we have a decent chance of being in that solution mix."", 'Yuan Zhi', 'Got it. And then a follow-up here is on the visibility of this offering evaluation buyers or customers. When can we get some clear picture -- the customer will come back to Augmedix, or customers will make these decision on which services they will choose?', 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Hey Yuan, it's Paul. First, our own customers are just switching products from the higher ARPU product, Live, to the more AI based product, Augmedix Go Assist. We're also seeing a number of our health systems slow down on the additional investment in Live as they evaluate other AI products. So maybe that's exactly what you're asking about.I think in a period of three to six months, they'll they'll tryout our AI product, other AI products, and then determine what their product mix looks like going forward.I think during this period of AI pilots -- Live is just being held on and not further investment is made -- once we get beyond the pilot in health systems, have more information about the capabilities of just pure AI versus AI and humans in Live, then I think then we can see what the product mix will look like on the other side. And I think there's still a place for Live room to grow. It's just going to have a different mix than we had in the past."", 'Yuan Zhi', ""Got it. That's all I have. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Allen Klee, Maxim Group.', 'Allen Klee', ""Yes, hi. If I was a Live user, why would I stick with live versus switching to Augmedix Go Assist? And then what's the relative price difference for the customer? I know you can't say that exact, but just kind of roughly. Thank you."", 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Hey Allen, it's a it's Manny. Good question. So the motivation for a clinician to stay with Live is because Live is much more impactful to the from daily lives. Number one, it will deliver the highest quality note possible simply because it's synchronous, and real-time and therefore, any ambiguities that occur during the ambient conversation, which is the only input that's available for a pure AI solution, that limitation doesn't exist with Live.So you get immediate response to any ambiguities that might occur during that ambient conversation that get reflected in the medical note. So the Medical Note is a very high quality, number one.Number two, the fact that there's a medical documentation specialist attached to the clinician means that the clinician can rely on that medical by condition specialist for ancillary services that are not available with a pure AI solution.And those services include orders, referrals, coding suggestions, and some nudges in the form of clinical decision support. So there's a lot more that comes with Live than you can possibly get with a pure AI solution, and the price differential between those products is substantial.The live solution, the ARPU is roughly $2,400 per month per doctor. And for the pure AI solution, or the one that has a -- Go Assist, for example -- they're going to have ARPUs anywhere from $300 to $600. So there's a big big difference, big drop in price, if you don't need that full time human support."", 'Allen Klee', ""Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I think I heard you say that you thought revenue might be up a little sequentially in the second quarter, but then we're basically starting from that lower base going forward is where I guess the impact is going forward for the second half? I guess that that's the way to think about it?"", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Yes, Allen, it's a good way to think about it. It's Paul. Remember, because we have the 90 day notification, any transitions from Live to Notes are going to largely happen in the back half of the year. So we'll see a little bit of a increase -- maybe 1% or 2% from the first quarter into the second quarter -- and then thereafter it it may it may decline Q-on-Q."", 'Allen Klee', ""Wait, I'm sorry. Did you say 3Q might be down versus 2Q?"", 'Paul Ginocchio', '[Greg], if you look at the guidance range, 3Q versus 2Q could be down.', 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Yes, as as as customers transition from higher ARPU products to lower ARPU products, that's a natural occurrence in the numbers. And it's just the shift in that product mix will have that happen."", 'Allen Klee', 'Okay. I got it. Okay, thanks --', 'Paul Ginocchio', ""Thanks Allen. Our goal offset that is obviously to penetrate those clients deeper, and that's the plan."", 'Allen Klee', 'Okay. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Bill Sutherland, The Benchmark Company.', 'Bill Sutherland', ""Thanks. Hey Manny, hey Paul. I'm just thinking about the math here a little bit, and your confidence to still get to the bogey of cash breakeven into '25.And just looking at the math here with the ARPUs, there is a growth rate that we can think about that, I mean, it's not that you're not growing Go Assist right now. That's not the $7.5 million delta. It's the mix shift in both cases, and so I'm thinking and up in terms of the EBITDA loss this year, kind of in the same place on that kind of revenue delta. Is that a good way to think about it?"", 'Paul Ginocchio', ""We're not guiding to EBITDA losses. I think I think you're generally in the right ballpark or ZIP code. But no, we didn't guide to that. But I don't think that's not a bad way to think about it.Remember, we've said we're going to exit 2025 at cash flow breakeven. We can still have any an adjusted EBITDA loss. And obviously, we have good working capital fundamental. So we can be a little bit what loss-making on adjusted EBITDA and still be cash flow breakeven as we exit 2025."", 'Bill Sutherland', 'And then just one quick one on the quarter itself, higher revenue per clinician was, was that mix?', 'Paul Ginocchio', 'Yes.', 'Bill Sutherland', 'So just a little bit more Live?', 'Paul Ginocchio', 'A little bit more live in the first quarter, correct.', 'Bill Sutherland', 'And Manny, HCA, any sense of how the clinical adoption will go? (inaudible) settings?', 'Emmanuel Krakaris', ""Yes, we're optimistic we're in there discussing just that with the with their team today. So if you recall, from the HEMS conference back in April, I was on a panel with one of the point people from HCA, along with one of the executives from Google Cloud business unit.And the person from HCA was very positively inclined and enthusiastic in his support of our product across the board. And so just a lot of encouraging comments that I think have been made public so you can you can look into that panel conversation, and hear for yourself how they feel about the company, Augmedix, and our product."", 'Bill Sutherland', ""Yes, I did read about that. That's great. Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it."", 'Paul Ginocchio', 'Thanks Bill.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now hand the conference over to Manny Krakaris for closing comments. Manny?', 'Emmanuel Krakaris', 'Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody, for participating in this earnings call.

Unfortunately, some corporations do suffer that fate -- but others manage to turn things around. Those companies that can navigate challenging conditions and come out stronger are worth considering for long-term investors.', ""Let's discuss two examples: Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Pinterest (NYSE: PINS). These tech leaders have had their share of detractors in recent years, but are largely proving the bears wrong. Read on to find out more."", 'Netflix is one of the undisputed leaders in streaming. But while the company has generated superior returns over the long run, the landscape has shifted considerably since Netflix first opened shop. Competition has intensified, with several major corporations dipping their toes in the waters.', 'Further, Netflix has faced slow or non-existent subscriber growth at various points, as well as the challenge of password sharing, which took a bite out of its revenue.', ""As Netflix faced these issues, many investors and analysts lost faith in the company's ability to still deliver outsized returns. However, the streaming specialist bounced back over the past few quarters. Its subscriber count is moving in the right direction again, top-line growth has increased, and free cash flow is growing nicely, among other positive developments."", ""Netflix turned things around by making key changes. It introduced a low-priced ad-supported subscription option, and cracked down on password sharing by making primary account holders pay extra for sub-accounts shared with people outside their households. Can Netflix keep going? It's worth emphasizing that although the company has made changes, its underlying strategy remains unchanged."", ""Netflix has revolutionized entertainment television by offering convenient streaming across multiple devices, including handheld ones, and an extensive library of content that can be binged anytime. This factor also helped it deal with the competition, since the content it offers is largely unique and includes quite a few original creations. There is still a large untapped market here, since streaming doesn't come close to 50% of total television viewing time, even in its most advanced markets like the U.S."", 'In March, streaming accounted for 38.5% of television time, with Netflix grabbing 8.1% of that total. So the global opportunity is massive. Netflix has at least two competitive advantages. First, its brand name has become intricately tied to streaming. Second, it collects vast data that helps guide its content creation strategy. The more people watch, the more it knows which shows people want to watch. And the more it creates such shows, the more people watch -- the network effect.', ""What's next for Netflix? It might not be smooth sailing from here on out -- there will be more headwinds. But the tech company still looks like an excellent stock for investors."", 'Pinterest faced similar issues as Netflix: Slowing top-line growth, declining monthly active users (MAUs), and stronger competition in the online advertising market. The stock was in free fall for some time, but it has now bounced back, along with its financial results and user growth.', ""In the first quarter, Pinterest's revenue jumped by 23% year over year to $740 million. MAUs reached 518 million, 12% higher than the year-ago period. Importantly, the company's average revenue per user (ARPU) jumped by 10% year over year to $1.46."", 'Pinterest is benefiting from a bounce back in the advertising industry. Beyond that, the social media giant also implemented various strategies that are paying off. One of them is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered recommendation system that helps drive engagement on the platform. This (and other) AI-backed initiatives are likely to continue having a positive impact on Pinterest.', ""The company's CEO, Bill Ready, highlighted the network effect happening here:"", ""As we train our models on more user signals, we're driving even further relevance in our content recommendations to further improve the user signals our AI can act upon."", ""Further, Pinterest continues to make its platform and its Pins (saved images) shoppable. One of the company's long-term goals is to turn Pinterest into an e-commerce hub where users can search for, save, and, ultimately, purchase the items they want. The company made progress on this front in the first quarter, something that also positively impacted its financial results."", ""Pinterest isn't that close to making every Pin on its platform shoppable, but the company will also benefit as its MAUs continue to grow and advertising dollars keep coming its way. The stock's long-term prospects look attractive."", 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The consensus estimate for earnings per share has remained unchanged at 52 cents over the past 30 days, which indicates a jump of 6.1% from the year-ago period earnings of 49 cents.It is also worth noting that leading up to its upcoming release, Walmart has made headlines by announcing job cuts and requesting remote employees to transition back to office spaces, per a media report. This move aligns with the company's ongoing efforts to streamline operations, as it aims for approximately 65% of its stores to be automated by the end of fiscal 2026.All said, the decision to invest in Walmart ahead of its quarterly earnings release demands a thoughtful evaluation of both potential rewards and inherent risks."", 'Walmart Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Walmart Inc.

Gains from higher-margin ventures, such as advertising, are also noteworthy.The focus on enhancing its physical store fleet has been instrumental, serving customers directly while also supporting a significant portion of e-commerce sales. Store remodeling initiatives have helped upgrade stores with advanced in-store and digital innovations. Concurrently, Walmart has strengthened its e-commerce operations through acquisitions, partnerships, and improved payment and delivery systems, exemplified by services like Express On-Demand Early Morning Delivery, the Spark Driver platform, investments in DroneUp and the Walmart+ membership program.However, challenges stemming from market saturation and increased competition from online retailers may temper Walmart's growth trajectory.

The award has been offered by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.', 'Valued at $332 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Oct 20, 2027.', 'Nations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like Lockheed Martin, which enjoy a dominant position in the development of missiles.', 'To this end, it is imperative to mention that LMT’s GMLRS is a combat-proven, highly accurate, all-weather, precision-guided rocket system, which is capable of delivering precision strikes farther than many conventional weapons. Notably, the company’s MLRS Family of Munitions includes a variety of precision-strike rockets and missiles, with ongoing evolutionary development to meet the needs of today’s warfighter. Impressively, GMLRS rockets boast a reliability rate of more than 98%.', 'Such remarkable features of the GMLRS are likely to have been boosting its demand significantly. This can be gauged from the fact that more than 60,000 GMLRS rockets have been produced to date.', 'The global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.', 'This should bode well for the missile industry, as evident from the Mordor Intelligence firm’s projection, which suggests a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period for the missile and missile defense systems market.', 'LMT’s proficiency in missile manufacturing, particularly that of GMLRS, positions it favorably to capitalize on such growth opportunities. The fact that Lockheed Martin is working with the U.S. Army to increase GMLRS production capacity to 14,000 per year in 2025 makes us confident that the company will witness more order flows for its GMLRS product, like the latest one. Such contract wins, in turn, are likely to boost revenue growth for the company’s MFC unit, which witnessed a solid 25.3% year-over-year growth in its top line in the first quarter.', 'LMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.', 'NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop’s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.', 'General Dynamics GD: General Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It also produces composite rocket motor cases and launch tubes for tactical and strategic missiles.', 'GD has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.', 'RTX Corp.

Money-related companies (like banks and brokers) have embraced technology as a means of better serving their customers since the advent of the world wide web in 1989."", 'The financial technology business is still rapidly evolving, and could look considerably different in five years.', ""To this end, here's a rundown of the three fintech stocks that may well end up as the best performers through 2030. Each company is perfectly positioned to capitalize on an opportunity that's not only sizable, but underestimated as well."", ""Online banking isn't anything new. But it's not out of line to suggest most major banks are still struggling on this front. Their digital offerings often look like afterthoughts, and don't necessarily mesh well with their brick-and-mortar presence."", ""That's not the case for SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI), however. It's been built from the ground up since its 2011 launch to be an online bank. It has no brick-and-mortar branches, in fact; it's strictly an online-only outfit. It still has all the offerings you'd expect from a more traditional bank, though, including lending, checking accounts, investing, deposits, and credit cards, just to name a few."", 'The thing is, its online-only service is more than enough to draw an ever-bigger crowd. It boasted a little more than 8.1 million customers at the end of the first quarter, which is 44% more than it had at the same time a year earlier. Indeed, SoFi has added customers in every quarter going all the way back to early 2020, when it was only serving slightly more than 1 million members.', 'This is still just the beginning, however.', ""See, for as much as the world (and North America in particular) has embraced the idea of handling banking matters online or via an app, we're at something of an inflection point. That is, today's young adults have never known a world without the internet; most of them don't even remember a world without smartphones. This crowd is completely comfortable with the idea of not having access to a physical bank branch. Indeed, a recent survey performed by the American Bankers Association indicates 74% of millennials prefer digital banking over in-person service, while 64% of Gen-Z says the same. This is in contrast with older consumers, most of whom will handle banking business online or with an app, but aren't exactly in love with the idea of not having a brick-and-mortar branch to visit if the need arises."", ""It matters simply because millennials recently became the single biggest segment of the U.S. population, according to Pew Research, and they're inching into their highest-earning wealth-building years. Don't be surprised to see SoFi's customer headcount growth rate accelerate from here."", ""PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) isn't just a fintech stock. It's arguably the original fintech name, launching in 1998 to help then-nascent eBay get its online marketplace and e-commerce business going. For years it was the only dedicated payment-tech player."", ""Serious rivals eventually made their way into the market in the meantime, of course. Block's Cash App and Adyen come to mind as direct competitors, although alternatives like Amazon Pay and a handful of cryptocurrency wallets chipped away at PayPal's share of the payment-intermediary market as well. The COVID-19 pandemic only put a brighter spotlight on these other payment options, as much of the world's commerce was suddenly being handled online."", ""With all of this dust finally settling though, something curious is becoming clear. That is, PayPal is still the payment platform market leader, and it's still growing. The company facilitates almost half of the world's online purchases, yet still managed to increase last quarter's total transactions to the tune of 11%, reaching 6.5 billion. That growth follows last year's 12% increase in the amount of total payment volume PayPal handled."", 'How is the aging company holding up so well in such a competitive environment?', ""Much of this resilience can be chalked up to the fact that it was the first to market. The world is familiar with the brand and its offerings, and therefore comfortable sticking with PayPal even though alternatives are available -- it's easier to keep a customer than it is to win a new one over."", ""It's also worth noting, however, PayPal arguably utilizes its whopping 200 petabytes' worth of digital data better than any of its competitors, direct or indirect. That's something Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss intends to do even more aggressively now that artificial intelligence tools can make it even more useful."", ""The kicker: Newcomers will be stepping into PayPal stock while it's priced at only 16 times its trailing per-share profits. For perspective, the S&P 500's current price-to-earnings ratio stands at a frothier 23 times its earnings."", 'Last but not least, add Mastercard (NYSE: MA) to your list of fintech stocks to buy for their superior performance potential between now and 2030.', ""No, it's not a top-of-mind fintech name. That's because it's been so well defined over the course of the past few decades as a credit card processor. Don't be fooled though. While it's still first and foremost a card payment intermediary, it's leveraging the power of technology to continue expanding its business."", 'Take its Labs-as-a-Service division as an example. This arm aims to ""co-innovate with clients to deliver high-impact, customer-centric experiences, creating breakthrough products, platforms and services."" This unit co-created airline Emirates\'s customer rewards program, for instance, while Mastercard\'s so-called Test & Learn tech allows retailers to determine which products are most in-demand, and then stock stores accordingly. Mastercard was also one of the earlier names to embrace the idea of cryptocurrency-based digital wallets,\xa0even without knowing what crypto\'s future looked like. These and plenty of other overlooked innovations are only made possible due to the advent of the right technologies, which Mastercard will gladly employ when there\'s good reason to.', 'Bolstering its opportunity is how often cash is still being used to buy and sell goods and services. The U.S. Federal Reserve reports roughly 18% of all payments made within the U.S. are made with cash, while another 13% are direct bank transfers. These are transactions that would arguably be better handled with a modern debit or credit card.', ""On that note, Mastercard's expected top-line growth of 11% this year is followed by next year's projected growth of more than 12%. That's measurably better than most other companies' growth rates for the same time frame. It's also a growth pace that will be sustainable for at least the next few years, as Mastercard continues to figure out how it can better leverage new technologies."", 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mastercard wasn’t one of them.

The bot can help users search for hotels, build itineraries for their trips and make small changes. The bot can be included in iMessage chat groups, or you can talk to it one-on-one on WhatsApp. For these apps, the bot sits behind a number and leverages ChatGPT."", 'You can chat with Romie by mentioning the bot on iMessage and ask it to summarize an itinerary it has built or suggest restaurants. The bot can take you directly to the Expedia app with links to an itinerary or suggestions.', 'Expedia is also introducing smart search on its site, which lets users describe what kind of hotels they want instead of selecting filters. For instance, you can type ""Rooftop and view of the sea"" while searching for hotels, and the search will return the best hotels with those features.', 'The company is testing all these features with a limited audience through its EG Labs program, which allows U.S.-based users to try the new features out.', 'Expedia said it pulls in data from various sources like AccuWeather and Yelp Network to tailor the search and the bot. The company said this allows it to update travelers on flight changes or changes in weather. It can also suggest, for example, hotels near the airport in case of a canceled flight.', 'Expedia started experimenting with AI last year when it introduced an in-app travel planning experience that used ChatGPT. It seems the company is now working on integrating AI into its core feature set.', 'Expedia\'s rivals have also made some moves. Booking.com introduced AI-powered trip planning features in June 2023, and Airbnb has tested AI-aided review summaries and is aiming to build what it calls the ""ultimate concierge."" In March, Kayak launched a new conversational tool and a screenshot-based price comparison feature.', 'Startups are also banking on AI-powered features to take on incumbent travel platforms.

The company also acquired FLYR.com, and Jason Calacanis-backed AI itinerary builder Roam Around earlier this year.', 'Rathi Murthy, CTO of Expedia Group, told TechCrunch over a call that despite a ton of competition in the space, the company is confident that its solution will stand out because it plays multiple roles.', '""While everybody talks about AI assistants, for me, having an AI assistant that is a travel agent, personal assistant, concierge, and always there at the ready for you to make changes, remedy your trip, and remove fit across the entire process proactively is a game changer. [...] We have been able to take the Expedia experience outside of our ecosystem and into channels like iMessage or WhatsApp and take advantage of that, which I think is unique,"" he said.', ""Murthy said that the only reason Romie can't be used in WhatsApp group chats yet is they have not yet figured out the dynamics of how the bot would work in that setting rather than any technical challenges."", 'Expedia also said it would launch a cross-date price comparison tool, an AI-powered help page, and guest review summaries as part of its spring update.', 'This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/expedia-starts-testing-ai-powered-features-for-search-and-travel-planning/']"

In 2023, the company generated 63% of its revenue from U.S. points of sale.', 'Skift caught up with Gorin Monday in Las Vegas, where thousands of Expedia Group partners gathered for the company’s annual Explore 24 conference over the next two days.', 'Here are eight takeaways from the interview:', 'Expedia recently completed a tech migration that brought together several of its brands onto one platform. The idea is to unlock growth from within but we also asked about the potential for acquisitions. ', 'Gorin: “There are always things to get done. On technology, the front-end migration is done. On acquisitions, I certainly don’t have anything to share right now. What we will do is be really thoughtful about where does it make sense to deploy our capital. I think we have a lot of great opportunities ahead of us organically. The first thing on my radar is about working to accelerate the growth of our company with all the investments we’ve made the last couple of years. It’s in our hands.”', 'Gorin said she will be spending a chunk of her time on expanding the company internationally for the sake of partners and customers, but the growth may be more tactical than in the past. ', 'Gorin: “What I can tell you is that we’re taking a measured approach as we do it to make sure that we’ve got the right formula to work in different countries. What’s your marketing mix? What are the product specifications you need for that country? I think in the past, perhaps we’ve gone kind of across the board, and I think here we’re being quite measured and thoughtful about where we want to go.”', 'In the first quarter, Expedia Group’s B2B business, where it powers travel programs for loyalty programs, banks, retail outfits and other travel agencies, generated nearly 29% of revenue. Is Gorin concerned that when Expedia powers travel for a major credit card company that Expedia is losing customers to that bank, making Expedia increasingly weaker? Some analysts have argued that Expedia should abandon such programs. ', 'Gorin: “I wonder if someone asked Amazon the same question when they started with AWS (Amazon Web Services) to empower other e-commerce players. Travel is a massive $2.3 trillion market. Despite us and other OTAs and large hotel chains, it’s still a quite fragmented market. A lot of people want to be in travel, whether they’re financial institutions who want to add it to a loyalty program, whether it’s long-tail, offline retailers.”', '“And so the fact that we can use our technology and our inventory to power them allows us to bring more value to our supply partners and others. It also, I think, creates this nice flywheel of improving the whole ecosystem. And to the question, does it cannibalize? I’m not worried about that.”', 'Vrbo, Expedia’s vacation-rental brand, hasn’t bounced back as quickly as hoped following the tech migration that put it on the same platform with Expedia and Hotels.com. We asked Gorin what the issues are.', 'Gorin: “We went through the migration in the second half of last year. Whenever you go through any migration, you’re going to take some steps back before going forward. You have to win back the travelers who are having those experiences.”', '“At the same time — because we knew that was going to happen — we pulled back in our marketing spend at a time that when there were some competitors that were becoming more active. We’re very bullish on Vrbo. I think it’s got a great brand, a great positioning, and really good supply. And so it’s just a matter of being tenacious, and continuing to grind out improvements.”', 'Is the new One Key loyalty program taking longer than expected to get going? Expedia Group last year folded multiple loyalty programs that it previously ran for its Expedia, Hotels.com and Orbitz brands into a single loyalty plan, One Key. Hotels.com had, in some respects, a more lucrative program and many Hotels.com customers haven’t embraced One Key. ', 'Gorin: “I would just say with any loyalty program there is not going to be a switch that you flip on overnight. We’re happy with the results that we’re seeing. We’ve rolled it out in the U.S., and we’re seeing good sign ups with new members. We’re seeing good signs on repeat bookings and engagement.”', '“One of the reasons to put One Key out there was to capture more trips within the Expedia Group ecosystem for a given traveler. And what we found is that people who were using their One Key cash or redeeming their one key cash on Vrbo, if they had earned it on Expedia or Hotels.com, 25% of those people had never used Vrbo before.”', '“So they were brand new to Vrbo. For those trip types, we would expect that they would repeat. So it is linking together this house of brands through the One Key loyalty program.”', 'Expedia is doing a lot more discounting through One Key. Booking.com started doing a lot of this discounting and merchandising a few years ago. Is it getting more competitive? Is it a race to the bottom?', 'Gorin: “People shop in a lot of different ways. We have to accept that. A lot of travelers out there are price sensitive, and they want to make sure that they’re getting what they’re actually buying. In our One Key program, we have member discounts. We have silver and gold tier member discounts. And we have great engagement from our hotel partners on those because they see that as a way to go get incremental travelers. And then when it comes to merchandising, I think we’re thoughtful about what are the returns relative to other marketing standards.”', 'Expedia introduced on Tuesday an upgraded version of your AI trip planner, Romie, to assist travelers from not only planning a trip but making changes during the trip. Will these generative AI trip planners become a sweet spot for the use of gen AI in travel?', 'Gorin: “I think we’re all testing to see how are people going to interact. We have great success using Gen AI internally, for example, in our call centers, and we’re testing it with some of our commercial teams. Our developers are using it. And of course we have it in a bunch of places in the product. So Romie? It’s just another example of us testing things. And then as always, in whatever country, you get feedback from travelers, and then you iterate from there.”', 'Expedia’s stock is down some 30% in the past few months. ', 'Gorin: “I’m focused on having products and experiences that are great for travelers, that partners love and want to be part of, and having an organization that has very engaged and motivated teams that are able to be creative. And I think if we do those things, the rest will take care of itself.”', 'Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.']"

The Expedia Group Media Solutions offering combines first-party traveler intent and purchase data with on- and offsite ad tools, planning and measurement capabilities and access to an in-house creative team.', 'The launch of Expedia Group’s Travel Media Network comes as more players enter the booming media network space, with companies like Chase, Marriott and ride-hailing leaders Uber and Lyft joining a growing list that already includes most major retailers and grocers. U.S. retail media ad spend nearly hit $50 billion in 2023 — similar to what advertisers spent on national and local linear TV — and is expected to grow another 30% this year, per Advertiser Perceptions U.S. Advertising Market Outlook.', 'For Expedia, the time for a built-out media network is now: not only has the company sold advertising for decades, but it has “unparalleled” global reach and scale, encompassing 200 booking sites in more than 70 countries, along with a B2B network that includes more than 60,000 partners, according to Rob Torres, senior vice president of media and affiliate solutions.', ""“We've seen this happening with some retailers and other type of commerce platforms, but you haven't seen a lot of that in travel,” said Torres, who joined Expedia in 2022 after 16 years in Google's travel advertising business. “Not all of the smaller companies have that data and travel insights to bring together in a big media network like we can. We think that we're onto something here because of that opportunity.”"", ""Before they can make trips of their own, customers must first navigate a travel purchase journey that is increasingly complex. Travelers, on average, view 141 pages of travel content in the 45 days before booking a trip, and nearly 3 in 5 travelers don't have a specific destination in mind or have considered multiple destinations, per data shared by Expedia."", ""“We're trying to solve a problem for our advertisers,” said Jennifer Andre, vice president of business development for Expedia Group Media Solutions. “It's overwhelming for them to figure out how to find that traveler and how to tie it all together and make their media buying easier.”"", ""Expedia's travel network leverages first-party intent data to target high-value travelers with onsite advertising as well as offsite ads on YouTube and connected TV, relying on a media, insight and planning team that spent over 12,000 hours in 2023 helping advertising partners to optimize their campaigns. The network is also partnered with publishers and platforms including Netflix and Disney+ that allow for extensions into newly created inventories."", '“We can put together these robust campaigns for our partners that are multifaceted and actually reach that customer wherever they are throughout their travel journey,” Torres said.', ""For an example of what Expedia can do, the company shared the results of a co-created campaign with nonprofit travel board Visit California that ran in London's Heathrow Airport. Expedia had both the inventory, having bought out all of the billboards in Terminal 5, and the insight that Visit California should target UK travelers, resulting in an effort that gave the brand 100% share of voice in the terminal and generated 275 million total impressions."", ""“It wasn't [Visit California] just buying out-of-home in isolation — they were buying it as part of our travel media network with owned-and-operated channels and other components of their strategy with us,” Andre explained."", 'Media networks continue to offer more and refined capabilities, around everything from content creation to measurement. With its ad offerings, data and insights and in-house creative team, Expedia wants to be a “one-stop shop” for travel advertisers.', ""“For our endemic partners that we're already working with, it may we may already have large strategic deals, but this just gives them an opportunity to go even deeper and potentially see us in a different way,” said Andre. “Not just 'Hey, I want to spend money on Expedia, how many bookings can you drive?' — we actually have the opportunity to create awareness and get them in front of travelers throughout the wider ecosystem.”"", 'Expedia executives also highlighted a lesser known offering about a B2B network that extends its capabilities to more than 60,000 partners. The B2B network is expected to be a ""growth vehicle"" for both the network and Expedia overall, Torres noted.', ""“Many of those partners where we are serving up hotel supply, we're also serving up our sponsored listings for hotels, so there's a way for our partners to extend their presence,” Andre added. “We don't think those people realize how big we are in that space and how Expedia is showing up and powering other players in the space.”"", 'The company\'s refreshed presence in the media network space also comes as industry leaders pave the way for determining what such offerings can mean for all advertisers. Walmart Connect and Home Depot\'s recently rebranded Orange Apron Media network are both making overtures to non-endemic brands outside of their respective retail and home improvement categories, a path that could be a ""huge opportunity"" for Expedia, Andre said.', '“We do work with some non-endemics now, but we think that this is going to open up the opportunity as we look at offering this audience off-site and working with some of our brand partnerships,” Torres added. “It could be a big, big deal.”']"

The award has been offered by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.', 'Valued at $332 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Oct 20, 2027.', 'Nations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like Lockheed Martin, which enjoy a dominant position in the development of missiles.', 'To this end, it is imperative to mention that LMT’s GMLRS is a combat-proven, highly accurate, all-weather, precision-guided rocket system, which is capable of delivering precision strikes farther than many conventional weapons. Notably, the company’s MLRS Family of Munitions includes a variety of precision-strike rockets and missiles, with ongoing evolutionary development to meet the needs of today’s warfighter. Impressively, GMLRS rockets boast a reliability rate of more than 98%.', 'Such remarkable features of the GMLRS are likely to have been boosting its demand significantly. This can be gauged from the fact that more than 60,000 GMLRS rockets have been produced to date.', 'The global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.', 'This should bode well for the missile industry, as evident from the Mordor Intelligence firm’s projection, which suggests a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period for the missile and missile defense systems market.', 'LMT’s proficiency in missile manufacturing, particularly that of GMLRS, positions it favorably to capitalize on such growth opportunities. The fact that Lockheed Martin is working with the U.S. Army to increase GMLRS production capacity to 14,000 per year in 2025 makes us confident that the company will witness more order flows for its GMLRS product, like the latest one. Such contract wins, in turn, are likely to boost revenue growth for the company’s MFC unit, which witnessed a solid 25.3% year-over-year growth in its top line in the first quarter.', 'LMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.', 'NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop’s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.', 'General Dynamics GD: General Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It also produces composite rocket motor cases and launch tubes for tactical and strategic missiles.', 'GD has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11%.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, David Fischel, Chairman and CEO of Stereotaxis."", 'David Fischel', ""Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Our last call two months ago included a fairly comprehensive overview of Stereotaxis and our strategy. We'll keep today's call more brief. I'll focus on three specific topics, our commercial results, progress in our comprehensive innovation strategy and acquisition of APT, which was just announced in a press release this afternoon. It's an exciting period with a lot of progress.Our commercial goal has been to maintain sales momentum and preserve our financial strength while preparing for a breakout enabled by our comprehensive innovation strategy. While the structural challenges of our old product ecosystem serve as a significant headwind, we continued to show commercial progress.Revenue in the first quarter grew 5% over the previous year, driven by increased robotic system sales. We grew system backlog since our last call with the receipt of two additional orders for Genesis robots. Both orders came from existing customers in Europe that are upgrading older labs to Genesis.The net impact of receipt of those orders and system revenue recognition in the first quarter has increased our current backlog to $16 million. As discussed more fully on our last call, there remains a healthy active pipeline of greenfield and replacement cycle customers for Genesis across our three key geographies. So the weaknesses in our historic product ecosystem, including the recurring catheter shortages of Johnson & Johnson harm and delayed purchase decisions.Our recent regulatory submissions of MAGiC and the positive clinical experience observed in our clinical trial partially helps. Our recurring revenue remains impacted by J&J's catheter shortages, which is impacting procedure volumes. We continue to see inconsistent availability of the J&J catheters flare up in various geographies and accounts, but expect overall recurring revenue in 2024 to be consistent with 2023.Our innovation strategy remains key to driving substantial commercial success, and we are making significant progress in multiple fronts. Stereotaxis' proprietary ablation catheter was submitted to the EU Notified Body and FDA during the first quarter. We were pleased with the responsiveness of both regulatory agencies.In Europe, we received a completeness check shortly following submission of our CE application. And soon after receipt of first round of clinical questions, we responded to those questions; and at the very end of last week, received a single follow-up question. That question did not raise concern, and we intend to respond shortly.We are still awaiting technical and biocompatibility question but note that there was substantial progress on those topics during the review last year. In the US, the FDA reviewed our PMA supplement and during a collaborative discussion, determine to convert the submission into a traditional PMA.That conversion took place, and the traditional PMA is now going through its initial review, leveraging the data we continue to collect from the MAGiC study taking place in Europe, along with the broader body of preclinical and bench data. Enrollment in the European study has progressed well with a continued perfect safety record for MAGiC and overall excellent performance. We plan to enroll additional patients in the study, appreciate the responsiveness and collaborative nature of both regulators, and look forward to working with them in the coming months to ensure the MAGiC catheter becomes available for patients and physicians who dependents.Our second major innovation effort is the development of a smaller cell-shielding robot to significantly enhance the accessibility of our technology. We are methodically working through the extensive testing needed for regulatory submission and successfully completed the majority of our tests with the robot performing very well. We continue to expect regulatory submissions in both the United States and Europe this quarter with European regulatory clearance expected midyear, followed by FDA clearance in the second half of the year.Following approval, we plan to use the current year to demonstrate the reality of the robot in the real-world use, enhance compatibility of the robot with various x-rays, and prepare our supply chain, manufacturing, installation, and commercial processes for a full launch in 2025. Our initial demonstrations of the robot physician customers reinforces our confidence that the availability of a smaller and more accessible robot will serve as a significant structural improvement to the pace and scale of adoption.Our third effort is to expand the scope of our robust value beyond electrophysiology into a broader range of endovascular indications. This has been predicated on the development of a family of robotically steered guidewires and guide catheters. The ramp-up in manufacturing of the guidewire is slightly slower than expected, but we expect regulatory submissions later in the third quarter with commercial availability at the end of the year. The guide catheter is being manufactured by APT, and we are delighted to be bringing that project in-house with the APT acquisition. We expect the catheter to be commercially available in early 2025.In China, our partner MicroPort has submitted all the key aspects of our product ecosystem for regulatory approval and has been responding to questions from China's NMPA regulatory body. MicroPort continues to expect approval of Genasense this summer and approval of the robotically navigated ablation catheter as well as integration with their mapping system before year end.MicroPort is ramping up training of its commercial team in anticipation of a launch. And we have begun a methodical program that provides group and one-on-one training on our robotic technology of all approximately 100 members of the MicroPort EP clinical sales team.Our last key innovation effort is our digital surgery platform for broad operating room connectivity. The Sync, cloud-based connectivity app remains in limited release, during which time additional features and improvements are being incorporated as we await the launch of the Synchrony integrated lab display.Synchrony should begin formal regulatory testing in a couple of months with regulatory submission later in the third quarter. While this is a synergistic and opportunistic venture to our core strategy, early feedback has been very positive and I can see this being a substantial independent business in the coming years. We will dedicate a future event to showcase the technology fully.These innovation, each individually and especially in combination are leaps forward clinically, commercially, and strategically. They improve the care, we can provide patients; experience, we provide physicians and our ability to meaningfully scale of business with a healthier and more attractive revenue and cost profile.As these key puzzle pieces come together, we are setting ourselves up with multiple shots on goal for breakout growth in 2025 and beyond. I want to recognize the Stereotaxis team driving this progress forward. It is amazingly impressive what our small team has been able to accomplish, the breadth of innovation, the quality of our work, and the ability to advance multiple projects forward in parallel as a lean team in a financially prudent fashion. We really have unique expertise and capabilities that are second to none.As we reflect on our experience advancing this wave of innovations over the past several years and look forward and strategize for the coming years, it becomes clear that one gap in our expertise is the lack of in-house capabilities to develop interventional disposal medical devices. Our reliance on various contract manufacturing partners has worked as a reasonable solution but is unlikely to be ideal for a future in which we are driving robust innovation and manufacturing of a broad family of interventional devices that work with our robots. With that eye towards the future, I'm very excited that APT will be joining Stereotaxis and contributing that expertise and capability. Our acquisition of APT is opportunistic, synergistic, and strategic.By way of background, I was introduced to APT by highly respected electrophysiologists that were using APTs differentiated, manually navigated diagnostic catheters and wanted a robotically steered version made to work with Genesis. As we had the opportunity to engage with APT's team, we were impressed with their expertise and the quality of their work.We began collaborating to develop a unique, high-density mapping catheter, the first magnetically, robotically steered diagnostic catheter for our community of robotic users. As that collaboration advanced well, we expanded our efforts to include a vascular guidance catheter.Earlier this year, the opportunity emerged to consider bringing APT into Stereotaxis. And acquisition made a lot of sense from a commercial and strategic perspective, and we appreciate that we were able to reach agreement on a transaction and ensured long-term alignment of interest and was financially prudent.From a commercial perspective, APT currently distributes -- uses distributors and sales agents around the world to sell its catheters. A substantial majority of these sales come from outside the US. The opportunity for these differentiated, high-quality catheters in the US is meaningful, but requires a dedicated sales team, which Stereotaxis can provide with synergies from a practical and messaging perspective.Stereotaxis has over 20 people in the field across the US who are particularly skilled and focused on enabling and improving the treatment of the most complex arrhythmias. APT's catheters have the potential to contribute incremental value and revenue in the practices our team already calls upon and to serve as a door opener at centers focused on complex arrhythmias to pave a path for the adoption of robotics. We expect APT to contribute approximately $5 million in annual revenue during the first-year post acquisition.From a strategic perspective, I mentioned earlier how the lack of in-house catheter development and manufacturing expertise has been limiting. APT's team, expertise, and capabilities will significantly amplify and accelerate Stereotaxis' next wave of innovation efforts as we look to develop a broader family of interventional devices that are navigated by our robots across a range of endovascular procedures. I warmly welcome the APT team to Stereotaxis and look forward to their contribution as core members in our mission.While specific financial terms of the transaction are not being disclosed, the majority of the acquisition consideration is predicated on meeting key regulatory and commercial milestones. Those milestones include regulatory approvals for specific robotically steered catheters, both in electrophysiology and endovascular applications and revenue milestones that will play out over the coming five years and are predicated on meaningful growth and adoption of APT catheters.The upfront and milestone considerations can be paid fully in stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. I'll now hand the call over to Kim, who will provide commentary on our financial results. After which, I'll make a few financial comments as well before opening the call to Q&A. Kim?"", 'Kimberly Peery', 'Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 totaled $6.9 million, a growth of 5% from $6.5 million in the prior year first quarter. System revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 million and recurring revenue was $4.3 million, compared to $1.8 million and $4.7 million in the prior year first quarter.System revenue in the quarter reflects revenue recognition on the delivery of a Genesis system and partial revenue recognition of other ancillary systems. Recurring revenue continues to be pressured by Johnson & Johnson catheter shortages.Gross margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 58% of revenue. Recurring revenue gross margin was 76%, and system gross margin was 27%. Operating expenses in the quarter of $8.7 million included $2.6 million in non-cash stock compensation expense.Excluding stock compensation expense, adjusted operating expenses were $6.1 million compared to prior year adjusted operating expenses of $6.9 million. The lower adjusted operating expenses reflect natural reductions in spending on various R&D projects as they have neared fruition and a general effort to be financially prudent across the organization, partially offset by increased clinical trial and regulatory spending.Operating loss and net loss for the first quarter of 2024 were $4.7 million and $4.5 million compared to $5.6 million and $5.3 million in the previous year. Adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss for the quarter, excluding noncash stock compensation expense were $2.2 million and $1.9 million compared with $3 million and $2.7 million in the previous year.Negative free cash flow for the first quarter was $2.3 million. At March 31, we had cash and cash equivalents of $18.2 million and no debt. I will now hand the call back to David.', 'David Fischel', ""Thank you, Kim. We're continuing to advance our technology and strategy in a financially prudent fashion. The first quarter is generally the highest cash burn quarter of the year, and we expect the remainder of the year to have a lower rate of cash utilization, even incorporating the expenses associated with acquiring, integrating and operating APT.Estimating revenue in any given period remains a challenge, and we are still too early in the quarter to provide a reliable estimate for this quarter. As we look out at the full year, we continue to expect modest double-digit revenue growth for the full year, driven by revenue recognition of system backlog and new system orders and not incorporating contribution of revenue from APT. We look forward to now taking your questions. Operator, can you please open the line."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Frank Takkinen, Lake Street Capital Markets.', 'Frank Takkinen', 'Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the progress. I was hoping to start with one on APT. Maybe just talking about current catheters you have in development MAGiC and the guidewire, is there any immediate synergistic help that they can provide with any of these products? Are those pretty much form factors locked down, sticking with Osypka for manufacturing? And APT is more for future developments, such as the robotic mapping catheter, just kind of curious how it can impact the business today.', 'David Fischel', ""Hi, Frank. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. So we're -- we obviously have a good long-term relationships with existing contract manufacturing partners, and we don't plan to make any changes. We plan to have continued long-term relationships with those partners.So this acquisition is really not relevant for the MAGiC catheter or the guidewire at this stage. We're really looking towards both the diagnostic EP catheter, the guide catheter, and then a series of additional disposable sterile interventional devices as we look towards the future."", 'Frank Takkinen', 'Okay. Fair enough. That makes sense. And then maybe shifting over to the PMA change related to the MAGiC catheter. Can you give a little bit more background on the switch from a PMA supplemental to a full PMA? And how might impact needed data for that submission and timeline?', 'David Fischel', ""Sure. So from a point of view of timeline for the submission, that is kind of the same as what it was before. FDA converted it internally on their side from the PMA supplement to a traditional PMA. There are certain things that are not allowed during the PMA supplement but are supported by a traditional PMA, like, for example, auditing, manufacturing facilities as part of the review process.And that were important to do, and those help drive the decision for the conversion. And so we had a good collaborative discussion with FDA after they received our PMA supplement submission. And as discussing some of what would be important in order to allow FDA to do a comprehensive review, they felt that that change would be beneficial.And as described in my prepared remarks, we anticipate still the existing data that we've been collecting to be sufficient for the submission, and so that is obviously helpful in the overall timeline and process. And so I think we've been fortunate to be able to have collaborative relationships with the regulators, both in the US and Europe, and to be able to kind of advance things in a fashion that is looking for the right solutions that allow a comprehensive review in a timely fashion."", 'Frank Takkinen', 'Okay. Got it. And then last one, maybe just on the capital equipment environment. Any update you can provide there as it relates to installation timelines, construction variability, ordering patterns or hesitancies around it, given some of the macro elements?', 'David Fischel', ""Nothing major to speak about there. I think that we're still in this middle ground. There's obviously challenges and headwinds, both in the macro environment and given our product ecosystem. There's also the tailwinds of general interest and demand in our technology and watching our innovation strategy come closer to fruition.And so I think kind of there's that balancing act to both of those. We're able to create some progress, given the gives and takes there. It's obviously not the type of scale of progress that we ultimately want to be able to show. And that's why we have our innovation strategy, and look forward to being able to actually start to bring that out into the real world."", 'Frank Takkinen', 'Got it. Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.', 'David Fischel', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Jason Wittes, ROTH MKM.', 'Jason Wittes', 'Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress here on all the submissions. Just on the -- just a follow-up on the PMA conversion to a traditional PMA, how does that affect timing? re there a few extra months added or -- and both in terms of just converting this to a traditional PMA and the additional steps that might be required for the full submission?', 'David Fischel', ""Hi, Jason. Good afternoon. Thanks. And so as I described on our last call, we view the submission to FDA not as an event where we submit something, sit back, and then wait the statutory clock to play out and then get a result. This is really part of a continuous dialogue and then -- and collaborative engagement on the regulatory process. And so I think that's exactly what played out over the last two months.Since our last call, we're pleased with the responsiveness of the agency to our submission. I think it was a particularly quick review and outreach to have a follow-up call and brainstorming on what the best path would be going forward. The conversion to the traditional PMA documentation, the payment of that application all played out already and now there is the initial review taking place of the traditional PMA application.The statutory timeline, again, is, I believe, a six-month time line with ability for there to be stopped during questioning. But again, I think, about this much more as a process. And I think that given kind of the engagement to date, I'm pleased with how we're able to find paths forward to make sure that this important device is available for patients and physicians in the US."", 'Jason Wittes', ""Okay. Thank you for that. That's helpful. And then on the APT acquisition, it sounds like a pretty good addition from a technological standpoint for you guys. You mentioned they have -- it sounds like they have quite a few unique catheters. It sounds like also, from your description, they're primarily sold in Europe at this point.So just the plan here, is it to convert those unique catheters to the robotics platform and sell them alongside with robotics? And also -- or do you also plan to sell the manual parts in the US as well?"", 'David Fischel', ""Sure. So a little bit more color there. APT makes a series of diagnostic manually navigated handheld catheters used in cardiac ablation procedures. It has some catheters, which have high-quality construction, but from a design perspective, are relatively similar to existing catheters out there. And then they have a few catheters that are fairly differentiated in providing additional clinical value in specific styles of cardiac ablation procedures.They sell the catheters globally. I say that, actually, their strongest region is a few countries in Asia. And then they have a decent amount of sales in Europe. And they have their weakest geography being the US, which is obviously interesting given typically, sales in the US outshines other geographies.We -- currently in robotic cardiac ablation procedures, manual handheld diagnostic catheters are always being used. There are no robotically steered diagnostic catheters that are available now or have ever been available. It's purely the ablation catheter, which is robotically steered. And so there's definitely the opportunity for their existing manually navigated catheters to be used in robotic procedures as they currently are and to be used more broadly in non-robotic procedures in the US at the accounts that we already call upon and where we have relationships.There is a specific diagnostic catheter that we have worked with, and that was, to some extent, the start of our relationship with APT, that we've been working with to make robotically steered. And that is in the late stages of development and will be exciting to bring to market. That will be the first time there's a robotically steered, high-density diagnostic catheter available to our community. And so that is definitely part of the strategy. But there's value to be at both in synergies, both from the existing portfolio of manual catheters and from that robotically steered variant in the future."", 'Jason Wittes', 'Got it. Thank you. And then just one more. For APT, I think you mentioned, the initial payment is going to be through stock issuance. The additional milestones, are those cash or stock payments? (multiple speakers)', 'David Fischel', 'Stock-based payment paid upon the milestones.', 'Jason Wittes', ""Got it. Thank you very much. I'll jump back in queue."", 'David Fischel', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler.', 'Adam Maeder', ""Hi, David, Kim. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Congrats on the deal. I wanted to follow up on the last line of questioning and ask about the commercial synergies. So for complex AF ablation procedures today and I guess specifically for complex arrhythmias, how many of those cases or what percentage of those cases use diagnostic catheters?And then I'd also be curious to hear a little bit more about the competition on the diagnostic catheter side. Who are you going to compete with there? And why does the APT technology win? And I have a follow-up or two. Thanks."", 'David Fischel', ""Okay, great. Hi, Adam. Thanks for the question. So diagnostic catheters are used in almost every cardiac ablation procedure. They're widely utilized. There are obviously some of the high-density mapping catheters like PentaRay or an HD grid catheter that have driven significant commercial growth for companies like J&J and Abbott. There's also all sorts of catheters that's in the blood vessels surrounding the coronary vessels, surrounding the heart and give you electrogram data from this -- from those region.And so there's a broad array of such catheters. And in some ways, these catheters will compete against, particularly catheters that sit in the coronary sinus or in some of the vessels surrounding the heart during the procedure.And there are a few catheters, as I mentioned, that are particularly differentiated in their design and capability and add value in cases where we add -- well, we are also adding predominantly the value for a robot. And those are kind of some of the complex ventricular tachycardia, some of the complex ventricular cases, congenital, pediatric cases. And so that's where the synergy will be most applicable.Our goal is not to try to have a broad array of every product that gets used in every cardiac ablation procedure. We want to remain laser-focused on advancing and enabling the most complex cardiac ablation cases and really adding differentiated value to the field of EP.I think these catheters, they share that type of messaging. And so our goal is not to become a generic catheter distributor but really to add value in a differentiated way. And again, there's the commercial synergy and then there's a strategic synergy in terms of bringing in an in-house development and manufacturing capability, which I think will provide a lot of value over the next several years as we really build out the razor blade aspect of the business in a far more robust fashion than what we previously discussed."", 'Adam Maeder', ""Got it. That's a very helpful color, David. Thank you for that. And then just one quick clarification. The $5 million revenue contribution from APT, did I interpret that correctly as being for calendar year 2025? Or is that for 12 months from close, which I think is expected in Q3?"", 'David Fischel', ""That would be for the first-year post closure. So it's -- let's see that might be three months, four months, five months before the end of this year but for the first year of full option."", 'Adam Maeder', 'Okay. Understood. And just one last one. Just curious, from an APT standpoint, do they have any pipeline initiatives that are targeting pulsed field ablation or any catheter IP that could potentially be helpful there? And if not, just curious how the company is thinking about pulsed field ablation, the importance there to potentially adding that to the portfolio over the long-term? Thanks so much for taking the question.', 'David Fischel', ""Sure. Thanks for that, Adam. So APT actually has done some work in PFA with one of the very prestigious hospitals in the United States. They do have some IP the-re, and they do have -- they've done kind of various clinical trials with a differentiated catheter that they built in conjunction with the physicians at that institution.And so there is some assets in the PFA world that come with this acquisition. Outside of APT, we have -- as we've talked in the past, we have been working with a few companies to explore robotically steered catheters that can deliver PFA during procedures, both in the atrium and in the ventricle. And we actually have a few animal studies with two different companies planned for the next, call it, one to three months looking forward.And so there was some meaningful work going on there. And when there's something more material where we can provide an actual timeline and when the first PFA catheter either is able to approach the market or approach a human study, we'll update you guys further."", 'Adam Maeder', 'Good color there. Thank you.', 'David Fischel', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Josh Jennings, TD Cowen.', 'Josh Jennings', 'Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I was hoping another APT follow-up. Just with the high-density mapping or all the diagnostic mapping catheters in the portfolio, are they integrated into a high-density or 3D anatomic mapping system? Or are they compatible with current mapping systems that are out and commercialized? Or how does that whole integration work and play out as you advance this platform?', 'David Fischel', ""Hi, Josh. Good afternoon. Very good question. So APT's catheters are currently compatible with a range of mapping systems out there. You're correct that the primary high-density mapping catheters, like an HD grid or PentaRay, are generally have to be fully integrated with the mapping system. There are though ways to pin various secondary diagnostic catheters, things like a coronary sinus catheter, into the various mapping system without it being fully integrated but being compatible. And so that is 0 very much a part of this industry, and that's how the catheters are currently being used."", 'Josh Jennings', ""And then just wanted to ask about, not the pipeline as we're moving forward, making progress to getting the multiple system approved. I think you've made some comments in your prepared remarks too, but just how is the pipeline shaping up for US and OUS as we sit here today in 2Q '24 versus maybe a year ago?"", 'David Fischel', ""So overall, we're -- from a development perspective on the robot side, we're delighted with how it's progressing. The device is working nicely in the testing. We're kind of methodically grinding through all of the tests necessary.We've started to share the system with visitors to our office. And the system is looking more and more -- as we receive the covers and have the LED lights, everything else, it starts to look more and more like a real commercial system. And so kind of we're happy with how that looks.From a pipeline in the field perspective, I'd say that Europe is starting to -- as kind of the first geography where we would expect the MAGiC catheter to come approved and the new robot to come approved. That is taking the lead in terms of the pipeline development.9It also benefits from the availability of a newer, more modern X-ray that is available in Europe now in which we just completed the first installation of in Italy. And so there is -- there was kind of an improving pipeline, I'd say, there.And overall, I think, we have kind of a good pipeline. We've not yet been able to go out in a robust way to commercialize and market aggressively this new ecosystem and this kind of concept of having a robot that doesn't require construction and that can be adopted more easily with various ways of being adopted, whether it's a capital sale or a lease or a placement with disposable commitments.And so there is kind of -- we are looking forward to being able to do that. We're doing some preparatory work to make sure we have a good pipeline as we're able to do that more fully. But we haven't obviously gone out yet until we have the approvals and are ready to do so -- to do that portfolio."", 'Josh Jennings', 'And then maybe just a similar question or a follow-up question on just China, the collaborate with MicroPort. And when should we be expecting orders to start flowing through to their sales force and that combined effort? Thanks a lot.', 'David Fischel', ""So MicroPort, it still expects Genesis approval in the summertime. And, by the end of the year, expects to have its catheter and that's integrate it with it's mapping system and us approved. I think about it probably in two steps. Having Genesis approved in China will be very helpful to start to allow some of the capital activity to flow. Having the full ecosystem available with the catheter will allow the broader MicroPort sales team to really actually participate in the commercial activities.So while MicroPort has a relatively smaller capital sales team that has been active and is kind of -- and will be particularly motivated and capable when Genesis is approved, we are starting to train both group settings and one-on-one settings for actually every single one of them.All, approximately 100 people on the MicroPort EP clinical sales team. And as the catheter is approved, that provides really the impetus for that entire team to talk with their daily customers and to try to drive adoption of their mapping system and their catheter portfolio using the robot as this differentiating lynchpin. And so I think about it in those two phases, particularly excited for that second phase, but I think there'll be some impact from the first phase."", 'Operator', 'All right. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to David Fisher for closing remarks.', 'David Fischel', 'Hey, thank you very much for your questions. We look forward to working hard on your behalf to realize key milestones prior to when we speak next quarter. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.""]"

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.', 'Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.', 'Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month.

A higher rate of patients discontinued all adjuvant therapy in the coformulation arm versus the Keytruda-only arm primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences. Due to this, it seemed unlikely that the study could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS.', 'Accordingly, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)\xa0recommended unblinding the study and guided Merck to offer patients receiving the Keytruda+vibostolimab coformulation to be treated with Keytruda monotherapy.\xa0Merck continues to analyze data from the study and will share the data with the scientific community and regulatory agencies at a later date.', 'At present, Keytruda is approved for two indications in melanoma.

As the study failed to reach superiority for the DFS endpoint, its other primary endpoint of overall survival was not formally tested.', 'Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounts for around 45% of Merck’s total pharmaceutical sales. Keytruda sales are gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications and rapid uptake across earlier-stage launches. Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. Numerous recent approvals and the expected launch of many additional indications, including in earlier lines of therapy, can further boost sales.', 'The Keytruda development program is also progressing well.

Currently, this global security company supplies a broad array of products like space systems, military aircraft, missile defense, advanced weapons and long-range fire capabilities, mission systems, networking and communications, strategic deterrence systems, and breakthrough technologies, such as advanced computing, microelectronics and cyber. As of Dec 31, 2023, the company operates through the following reportable segments:Northrop Grumman's Aeronautics Systems unit focuses on the development, integration, production and support of manned aircraft, unmanned autonomous systems as well as airborne battle management and command and control systems. In 2023, this segment’s revenues came in at $10.79 billion, contributing 27.4% to the company’s total revenues.Its Defense Systems unit focuses on production of advanced tactical weapons and missile defense solutions. It is also a provider of sustainment, modernization and training services for manned and unmanned aircraft and electronics systems. In 2023, this segment’s revenues came in at $5.86 billion, contributing 14.9% to the company’s total revenues.The company's Mission Systems unit includes airborne sensors and networks, cyber and intelligence mission solutions, maritime/land systems and sensors, along with navigation, targeting and survivability. In 2023, this segment’s revenues came in at $10.90 billion, contributing 27.7% to the company’s total revenues.Its Space Systems unit focuses on launch and strategic missile systems as well as varied space related products like satellites and spacecraft systems, sensors and payloads along with launch vehicles and related propulsion systems. In 2023, this segment’s revenues came in at $13.95 billion, contributing 35.5% to the company’s total revenues.However, total revenues of $39.29 billion in 2023 were adjusted for inter-segment eliminations of $2.20 billion."", 'Bottom Line', ""Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Northrop Grumman a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today."", 'According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $3,873, or a 287.30% gain, as of May 14, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.', 'The S&P 500 rose 175.18% and the price of gold increased 71.89% over the same time frame in comparison.', 'Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for NOC.', 'Northrop ended first-quarter 2024 on a bright note, with both its earnings and sales surpassing their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Impressively, GMLRS rockets boast a reliability rate of more than 98%.', 'Such remarkable features of the GMLRS are likely to have been boosting its demand significantly. This can be gauged from the fact that more than 60,000 GMLRS rockets have been produced to date.', 'The global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.', 'This should bode well for the missile industry, as evident from the Mordor Intelligence firm’s projection, which suggests a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period for the missile and missile defense systems market.', 'LMT’s proficiency in missile manufacturing, particularly that of GMLRS, positions it favorably to capitalize on such growth opportunities. The fact that Lockheed Martin is working with the U.S. Army to increase GMLRS production capacity to 14,000 per year in 2025 makes us confident that the company will witness more order flows for its GMLRS product, like the latest one. Such contract wins, in turn, are likely to boost revenue growth for the company’s MFC unit, which witnessed a solid 25.3% year-over-year growth in its top line in the first quarter.', 'LMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components.

Though commodities like gold and oil, along with housing and Treasury bonds, have produced positive nominal returns for investors, none of these other asset classes have come close to delivering the annualized returns that stocks have generated over the last century.', ""With the three major stock indexes recently hitting fresh all-time highs, some investors might be leery of putting new money to work on Wall Street. But with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite eventually (key word!) erasing every notable downturn they've had throughout history, anytime can be the ideal moment to invest if you have a long-term mindset."", 'Putting your money to work on Wall Street is especially fruitful given that most online brokers have removed barriers that had previously kept retail investors on the sidelines. More specifically, minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for common stock trades on major U.S. stock exchanges are now a thing of the past. This means any amount of money -- even $500 -- can be the perfect amount to put to work on Wall Street.', ""If you have $500 that's ready to invest, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergencies as they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", ""The first exceptional business that makes for a surefire buy if you have $500 that's ready to be put to work on Wall Street is payment-processing leader Visa (NYSE: V)."", ""Every publicly traded company has headwinds it contends with, and Visa's is simply that it's cyclical. This is to say that it ebbs-and-flows with the health of the U.S. and global economy. If the U.S. were to dip into a recession, aggregate spending and the total number of transactions facilitated by Visa would be expected to decline. At the moment, a couple of predictive indicators, including a meaningful drop in U.S. M2 money supply, suggest there's a real possibility for a downturn in the U.S. economy."", ""Thankfully, the economic cycle is a two-sided coin that's not proportionate. Since World War II ended in 1945, nine of 12 U.S. recessions were resolved in less than a year, while the remaining three failed to surpass 18 months in length. Most periods of economic growth stick around for years, which allows Visa to take advantage of a steady ramp in aggregate consumer and enterprise spending."", ""Something else to add to the above is that Visa's management team has kept the company focused solely on payment facilitation. While some of its payment-processing peers double dip and also generate interest income as lenders, these companies endure the added risk of credit delinquencies and loan losses during recessions. Visa doesn't have to worry about setting capital aside to cover loan losses during short-lived economic downturns, which is a key reason why it's able to sustain a profit margin of greater than 50%!"", 'Despite its size (a $574 billion market cap), Visa has such an extensive growth runway beyond the borders of the U.S. that it should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate. Cross-border volume in the March-ended quarter surged 16%, which speaks to just how underbanked most emerging markets are. Visa has the abundant operating cash flow needed to organically or acquisitively expand its infrastructure in fast-growing emerging markets.', 'Further, Visa is the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. No other payment processor grew its share more than Visa following the Great Recession.', ""The second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought right now by opportunistic investors with $500 is cybersecurity company Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA)."", 'The biggest obstacle Okta will have to overcome is a security breach the company experienced late last year. Okta had to own up to the fact that hackers accessed sensitive information from its platform. While breaches are less than ideal for a company whose sole purpose is to protect against them, there are, nevertheless, multiple reasons for patient investors to be excited about the future.', ""On a broader scale, cybersecurity is effectively a basic need service for any business that has an online or cloud-based presence. Robots and hackers don't care how well or poorly the economy and/or the stock market are performing. They want sensitive information and will stop at nothing to get it. The responsibility of protecting this data is increasingly falling to third-party providers, such as identity verification solutions provider Okta."", ""The primary reason to be optimistic about Okta's future is that its Cloud Identity platform is cloud-native and reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In other words, it's overseeing countless events each day and learning how to spot and respond to potential threats. We've seen a number of endpoint cybersecurity providers lean on AI and ML solutions to strengthen their platforms."", ""Okta is also still very early in its expansion. During the company's Investor Day in November 2022, management spoke of an $80 billion addressable market in identity verification. Two years after this meeting, Okta is on track to generate about $2.5 billion in annual sales. It has ample opportunity to expand its market share in the coming years."", ""As I've previously pointed out, Okta's 2022 acquisition of Auth0 will likely prove critical to its long-term success. Auth0 gives the company beefed-up representation in the $30 billion addressable market for Customer Identity, and is playing a key role in pushing Okta's influence beyond the borders of the U.S."", ""Wall Street's consensus calls for Okta's earnings per share (EPS) to more than triple to $5.20 over the next four years."", 'A third no-brainer stock to buy with $500 right now is none other than pharmaceutical titan Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).', ""Over the last two years, one of Wall Street's largest drug developers became a victim of its own success. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Pfizer was one of a handful of companies to successfully develop a vaccine (now known as Comirnaty). It also developed an oral treatment (known as Paxlovid) to lessen the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in patients that tested positive. Collectively, Comirnaty and Paxlovid generated more than $56 billion in sales in 2022. This year, they're expected to combine for just $8 billion in revenue."", ""Though this rapid ascent and decline in Pfizer's sales clearly has Wall Street and investors off-kilter, it's important to look at just how far Pfizer has progressed from where things stood just a few years earlier."", ""In 2020, the company reported nearly $42 billion in total sales. Meanwhile, the midpoint of its sales guidance in 2024 is $60 billion. That's an estimated sales increase of 43% in four years, which is pretty impressive for a large-scale pharma company."", ""More importantly, Pfizer's novel drugs beyond its COVID-19 therapies have continued to grow at a steady pace. Excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, Pfizer's sales jumped by 11% on a constant-currency basis in the first quarter. The core driver was its oncology segment, which delivered 19% operational sales growth. The superstar here was advanced prostate cancer drug Xtandi, which grew sales by 23% from the prior-year period, and is currently pacing an annual run-rate of almost $1.7 billion in revenue."", ""Additionally, Pfizer closed its $43 billion acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen in December. Although this buyout is expected to weigh on EPS in 2024, this combination should yield meaningful cost savings in future years. Not to mention, it's also going to rapidly expand Pfizer's oncology pipeline."", ""With Pfizer's supercharged yield of 6% not in any danger, and its shares valued at just 10 times forward-year earnings, the stock looks like a plain-as-day bargain."", 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

The drug maker experienced a massive surge in sales and earnings during the COVID-19 pandemic's height, thanks to demand for vaccines and other related treatments."", ""Pfizer's sales and earnings then dropped sharply as those treatments were less coveted by the public, but the most recent quarterly results suggest that things have normalized and that the company can return to modest growth."", ""A robust research and development pipeline is essential for a pharmaceutical company's future success, and Pfizer has one of the strongest pipelines in the industry. It has over 100 candidates in various stages of clinical trials, many of which have major revenue potential."", 'The company has scored several important approvals in recent years, and it supplemented internal development with a handful of large acquisitions. Analysts expect substantially higher revenue potential by the end of the decade, thanks to those efforts.', ""The market seems to be discounting Pfizer's opportunities, according to the stock's valuation ratios. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is under 13, and its enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio is even lower. The stock is cheap relative to its current and forecast near-term profits. Its dividend yield is around 6%, so the stock is also inexpensive relative to the dividends that it currently pays."", ""These valuation metrics are surprising for a business with a clear pathway to growth. Pfizer also recently beat analysts' quarterly earnings estimates, so there's evidence that it's moving through a recovery phase ahead of schedule."", ""COVID treatments still make up a significant portion of Pfizer's revenue, and those are likely to struggle. Fortunately, its reliance on those products is dwindling. It's also reasonable to apply some discount to the expected future cash flows from products in Pfizer's pipeline. Regulatory, clinical, and competitive pressures all present uncertainty and potential challenges."", ""Nonetheless, this value stock pays a healthy dividend today, so there's a basis for immediate and compounding gains, regardless of how the stock price moves in the short term.

The company is one of the leaders in gene therapy. It is developing several products that could drastically change the way serious diseases are treated.', 'The company received its first regulatory approvals last year. Its first product, Casgevy, is now approved in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain for the treatment of sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Casgevy was developed in a partnership with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which seems to be valuable for successfully commercializing the product.', ""There are already numerous treatment centers around the world that are seeing patients. The biotech companies have also signed important contracts with private insurers and government payors, so there has been agreement on pricing and a clear pathway to revenue in the near term. It's been an eventful few months for CRISPR."", ""CRISPR lies on the opposite end of the growth-value spectrum from Pfizer. The biotech company still hasn't reported any meaningful revenue, and it burns cash every quarter. It only has one product that's just starting to be commercialized, and it will have to share that revenue with Vertex. Its $5 billion market capitalization relies on speculation about potential cash flows from products that are still in development."", ""The company's recent success should give investors confidence.

But for the past couple of years its growth rate has been much more pedestrian, with the company's revenue only increasing by 9% in the most recent quarter."", ""Growth has slowed for PayPal. And here's another struggle for the company: The growth that it does have is of lesser quality. Much of its growth has come from its unbranded checkout solution, which powers some platforms behind the scenes. This has a lower profit margin. So while its overall revenue is up, its profit has barely moved."", ""PayPal has struggles. But new Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss is looking past some of them to its Venmo business, where there's one metric that's more than just a struggle -- Chriss finds this statistic simply unacceptable."", 'Venmo is peer-to-peer financial technology (fintech). With the mobile app, users can connect and send money back and forth, often to split the cost of a meal or similar group activity.', 'In the earnings call to discuss financial results for the first quarter of 2024, here\'s what Chriss had to say: ""There\'s $18 billion of net new funds that flow into the platform of Venmo every single month. Eighty percent of those dollars leave within 10 days. That is just unacceptable.""', ""PayPal's management apparently wants its users to pay for things from their Venmo accounts, not transfer balances to other financial institutions to pay from there. The inferred reason for this is that banks make easy money off of customer balances. But that's precisely why it may be hard to persuade people to keep funds in Venmo."", ""First, Venmo isn't a bank, and doesn't come with the same guarantees that traditional bank accounts do. Second, bank accounts earn interest -- not much, but at least it's something. By contrast, money in Venmo doesn't earn anything. In short, there's no reason to keep a Venmo balance. In fact, it's shocking to me that Chriss says that 20% of the money actually does sit there."", ""Before investing in PayPal stock, one should know what the company owns and how it fits into the bigger picture. In this case, Venmo accounts for 17% of PayPal's total business from a payment volume perspective as of Q1. And the platform has 60 million monthly active users -- not inconsequential."", ""Both the PayPal platform and the Venmo platform mostly address the same side of the fintech ecosystem: consumers, not businesses. I've noted that Chriss wants users to pay for things from Venmo, but the same could be said for PayPal's core platform as well. To stimulate this, the company is pushing its debit card, which allows the digital-first company to process transactions offline -- this is part of Chriss's plan to deal with what he finds unacceptable for Venmo."", ""Growth is encouraging for both platforms in this respect. In Q1, only about 4% of PayPal's accounts used the accompanying debit card. But first-time debit card users were up 38% year over year. Over on Venmo, there was a 21% increase in debit card users."", 'There are some encouraging signs with Venmo, but PayPal is facing an uphill climb to get more funds to stay on the platform instead of being transferred elsewhere. Investors should watch debit-card penetration in upcoming quarters since this is a point of emphasis from management. Increased debit card usage could lead to better monetization of Venmo.', 'That said, PayPal is still the dominant part of this business, and management has said that 2024 will be a ""transition year."" This means that overall financial results may take time to show improvement, giving investors plenty of time to calmly evaluate PayPal\'s progress with Venmo for now.', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PayPal wasn’t one of them.

It's been built from the ground up since its 2011 launch to be an online bank. It has no brick-and-mortar branches, in fact; it's strictly an online-only outfit. It still has all the offerings you'd expect from a more traditional bank, though, including lending, checking accounts, investing, deposits, and credit cards, just to name a few."", 'The thing is, its online-only service is more than enough to draw an ever-bigger crowd. It boasted a little more than 8.1 million customers at the end of the first quarter, which is 44% more than it had at the same time a year earlier. Indeed, SoFi has added customers in every quarter going all the way back to early 2020, when it was only serving slightly more than 1 million members.', 'This is still just the beginning, however.', ""See, for as much as the world (and North America in particular) has embraced the idea of handling banking matters online or via an app, we're at something of an inflection point. That is, today's young adults have never known a world without the internet; most of them don't even remember a world without smartphones. This crowd is completely comfortable with the idea of not having access to a physical bank branch. Indeed, a recent survey performed by the American Bankers Association indicates 74% of millennials prefer digital banking over in-person service, while 64% of Gen-Z says the same. This is in contrast with older consumers, most of whom will handle banking business online or with an app, but aren't exactly in love with the idea of not having a brick-and-mortar branch to visit if the need arises."", ""It matters simply because millennials recently became the single biggest segment of the U.S. population, according to Pew Research, and they're inching into their highest-earning wealth-building years. Don't be surprised to see SoFi's customer headcount growth rate accelerate from here."", ""PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) isn't just a fintech stock. It's arguably the original fintech name, launching in 1998 to help then-nascent eBay get its online marketplace and e-commerce business going. For years it was the only dedicated payment-tech player."", ""Serious rivals eventually made their way into the market in the meantime, of course. Block's Cash App and Adyen come to mind as direct competitors, although alternatives like Amazon Pay and a handful of cryptocurrency wallets chipped away at PayPal's share of the payment-intermediary market as well. The COVID-19 pandemic only put a brighter spotlight on these other payment options, as much of the world's commerce was suddenly being handled online."", ""With all of this dust finally settling though, something curious is becoming clear. That is, PayPal is still the payment platform market leader, and it's still growing. The company facilitates almost half of the world's online purchases, yet still managed to increase last quarter's total transactions to the tune of 11%, reaching 6.5 billion. That growth follows last year's 12% increase in the amount of total payment volume PayPal handled."", 'How is the aging company holding up so well in such a competitive environment?', ""Much of this resilience can be chalked up to the fact that it was the first to market. The world is familiar with the brand and its offerings, and therefore comfortable sticking with PayPal even though alternatives are available -- it's easier to keep a customer than it is to win a new one over."", ""It's also worth noting, however, PayPal arguably utilizes its whopping 200 petabytes' worth of digital data better than any of its competitors, direct or indirect. That's something Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss intends to do even more aggressively now that artificial intelligence tools can make it even more useful."", ""The kicker: Newcomers will be stepping into PayPal stock while it's priced at only 16 times its trailing per-share profits. For perspective, the S&P 500's current price-to-earnings ratio stands at a frothier 23 times its earnings."", 'Last but not least, add Mastercard (NYSE: MA) to your list of fintech stocks to buy for their superior performance potential between now and 2030.', ""No, it's not a top-of-mind fintech name. That's because it's been so well defined over the course of the past few decades as a credit card processor. Don't be fooled though. While it's still first and foremost a card payment intermediary, it's leveraging the power of technology to continue expanding its business."", 'Take its Labs-as-a-Service division as an example. This arm aims to ""co-innovate with clients to deliver high-impact, customer-centric experiences, creating breakthrough products, platforms and services."" This unit co-created airline Emirates\'s customer rewards program, for instance, while Mastercard\'s so-called Test & Learn tech allows retailers to determine which products are most in-demand, and then stock stores accordingly. Mastercard was also one of the earlier names to embrace the idea of cryptocurrency-based digital wallets,\xa0even without knowing what crypto\'s future looked like. These and plenty of other overlooked innovations are only made possible due to the advent of the right technologies, which Mastercard will gladly employ when there\'s good reason to.', 'Bolstering its opportunity is how often cash is still being used to buy and sell goods and services. The U.S. Federal Reserve reports roughly 18% of all payments made within the U.S. are made with cash, while another 13% are direct bank transfers. These are transactions that would arguably be better handled with a modern debit or credit card.', ""On that note, Mastercard's expected top-line growth of 11% this year is followed by next year's projected growth of more than 12%. That's measurably better than most other companies' growth rates for the same time frame. It's also a growth pace that will be sustainable for at least the next few years, as Mastercard continues to figure out how it can better leverage new technologies."", 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mastercard wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Consider when\xa0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $553,880!*', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Very collaborative, very transparent. They always had ‘our success is your success’ mentality from a customer lens. We looked at a couple other places to think about taking our whiskey to but Bardstown was head and shoulders above any other thing that we looked at when I was at Molson', 'PM: It’s actually gotten bigger because Molson Coors bought Blue Run and Blue Run was an existing Bardstown partner as well. The contract element is still the majority of our business. We have three revenue streams: our own brands, contract partnerships – what we got customer distillation – and we have hospitality. Our own brands, Green River and Bardstown, are kind of in their ascendancy and then the workhorse for us is our custom distribution business.', ""PM: Number one, it's culture. When I say our success is shared by our partners and vice versa, it's part of the cultural DNA of how the company in Bardstown was birthed. We started as a contract partner. The second thing is the product. We make really, really high-quality whiskies that have been celebrated and lauded and recognised around the world. We’re the 2023 IWSC Whiskey Producer of the Year, not only for the work we’ve done on our own brands but also the work we’ve done for our partners."", ""PM: We want to make sure we’re keeping our eye on expanding our contract distillation partnerships. It's the majority of our business. We’ve just added the third still in our Bardstown Kentucky distillery last year. We did that for two reasons: to make sure we've got enough whiskey for our own brands as we continue to grow and scale but the other big part of it is we never want to not be in the contract distillation business. We don’t want to turn away existing customers. We don’t want to say ‘well, we can’t handle your business anymore because we have to move all of the whiskey over to our own brand.’"", ""Number two, we still have a lot of runway to go to fill out the US map from a geographic expansion standpoint. Part of my job is to help scale both of our brands, not only domestically but also internationally. We have two minor flags planted internationally. We've got Bardstown available in the UK in a few locations right now and also in Australia."", 'The other big part of my job is to help think through some M&A opportunities. We are blessed to have a great partner in Pritzker Capital. Pritzker started by buying Bardstown and then they helped us buy Green River. We will make some other brand investments and we will also look for other M&A opportunities to plug into our platform.', 'PM: Whatever profitability we get from any part of our business allows us to reinvest money back into our company and that money will be reinvested into our facilities, into expansion, into M&A and into our own brands for sure.', 'PM: Well, as I mentioned, we made a big investment last year by adding a third still into our Bardstown distillery. We did that because the business had been growing pretty rapidly. There is more competition coming online right now in the state of Kentucky and elsewhere, so we do think the growth rate will moderate a bit, because there’s more supply. There was more demand and supply. Now, we think they’re going to come into a bit more balance.', 'But we also feel we are in a very unique position because of our approach and because of our reputation for quality and our reputation for customer service. We’re optimistic about what the future looks like for us from custom distillation standpoint but we’re also not going to take anything for granted.', 'PM: I think spirits in general – or I would even probably say beverage alcohol in general – has had a bit of a mean reversion. I think that there was a balancing out after Covid. The market dynamics that were created through and after Covid are not sustainable, so we’re very I think realistic about what that means for beverage alcohol but we’re also very optimistic about what it means for us.', 'Bardstown has been this tough-to-find, on-allocation brand, that Bourbon enthusiasts were seeking out. We’re getting to the point where we’re going to be able to satisfy more demand for our product, which is going to allow us to expand more geographically, again, both domestically and internationally.', ""PM: Green River, on the other hand, is, I think, into a very good sweet spot for what consumers are looking for today because it’s line-priced at $34.99. I think the value for the price we offer for Green River is exceptional. I do think some of the brands that were in the super-premium end of the business that were basically straight-lining their trends coming out of Covid, they've got some they’ve got some things that need to rectify. That’s not the situation we found ourselves in."", ""PM: When you think Bardstown, it’s all about the art of blending. It’s about innovation. It’s about transparency. We've got the opportunity and the privilege to work with some unbelievable collaborative partners. We just announced our newest collaboration with an Indian whisky [with Amrut Distillery]. We do things at Bardstown that are neat and innovative. The place we want to hold in whiskey drinkers minds [is] about being collaborative, innovative, unique, and distinctive."", 'Green River is the exact opposite in some ways. As Bardstown is new and innovative, Green River is authentic and historic and been around for almost 150 years.', 'We think about [distribution] from a home backyard and beyond standpoint. We want to make sure we’re really relevant and strong in our home, which is Kentucky. Obviously, [it’s] one of the most competitive Bourbon markets in the country, as you would imagine, given it’s the birthplace of Bourbon, but we are performing very well in Kentucky.', 'Then when you’re looking at neighbouring states and start to push out from there: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois. Then beyond that, we’ve got a nice business in Texas, in Georgia, in Florida. Where we show up, we’re doing very well and we’re trying to figure out what the right pace and expansion is beyond that.', 'PM: As a private company, we don’t give out that specific information. I would say our business is healthy and, again, I would just tell you that we are optimistic about our business plans in this year and then the outlying years.', 'We’re doing a little bit of renovation in our route to market. When we started, we, by design, wanted to a big fish in a small pond. We were looking for distributors that didn’t have big whiskey books and that could provide us a little bit more focus and attention. Now we’re getting to the place where we’re kind of graduating beyond some of those smaller outfits and we’re trying to upscale and uplevel our ability to have a route-to-market partner that can grow with us.', ""I’m here in downtown Chicago right now because we’re about to meet with Breakthru, which is a new relationship for Illinois. We’re expanding into to Nevada with them as well. Breakthru I think is the third-largest spirits distributor in the country. They’ve got the ability to grow with us in a very unique way. We are looking at our route-to-market right now, much like we’re looking at everything to make sure that we are really fit to fight in our future and that we're going to be able to be a disruptive whiskey company for the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years."", ""PM: It is ongoing right now and it probably won't really be completed until we're fully national and distribution, which will probably be another two-plus years."", 'PM: Last year.', 'PM: I think we’re really just in London and the surrounding areas and really just in very specific high-end locales. I would describe it as we’re really just planting seeds. It’s very early days. We want to be present for whiskey enthusiasts in both of the markets but, at some point, we’re going to keep watering those seeds and hopefully they’ll grow into nice flowers for us.', ""PM: A little too early to say. We've got an international discussion in the next couple of months to see how we want to continue to expand internationally but we’ve still got a lot of work to do in the US."", 'PM: Historically,when you launched into new markets in beverage alcohol, you wanted build in the on-premise first and that’s where people had the opportunity to really sample your product. Covid changed all that and so I think now when you launch new markets it’s as much about the off-premise as it is about the on-premise.', 'The importance of chain accounts from an off-premise standpoint, whether it’s Total Wine & More or a lot of the big supermarkets where they can sell spirits, those are as important as they’ve ever been, and that was really something that happened coming out of Covid. So, for us, it’s really both-and.', 'PM: Momentum, a path to continued growth, something that we can see that can become scalable and profitable. We’re really looking at right now in brown spirits. We might move beyond that in the future but we’re really focusing in continued on brown spirits still.', ""PM: Yes, there are but I'm not going to elaborate."", '""“Spirits has had a bit of a mean reversion.

Vehicle sales are expected to grow this year, albeit at a slower rate compared to 2023 amid inflationary pressure, high borrowing costs and economic uncertainty. While increased labor expenses stemming from the recent UAW agreement will play a deterrent, the effects of it would be largely offset by declining input costs. Normalization of supply chains has boosted inventory levels but margins are under pressure due to heightened consumer discounts.', 'Although electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to increase this year, it will require more effort from companies to drive sales due to a slower-than-expected pace of adoption, underscoring the need for the industry to navigate evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics. Two industry participants — General Motors and Blue Bird Corp. — are well-positioned to drive gains to your portfolio.', 'The Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through.', 'The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.', 'Vehicle Sales Growth to Decelerate: New vehicle sales in the United States rose 5.1% in the first quarter of 2024 backed by strong inventory, incentives and healthy fleet volumes. The seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter came in at 15.4 million, implying a year-over-year uptick of 2.7%. While vehicle sales are projected to grow in 2024, inflationary pressure, high costs of borrowing and an uncertain macro environment are expected to influence purchase decisions and slow down the pace of growth rate relative to 2023.', 'Manufacturing Costs Dynamics: The UAW agreement reached in 2023 is set to raise labor costs for all automakers as the firms aim to stay competitive in attracting and retaining talent. General Motors and Ford anticipate a roughly $9 billion increase in costs over the four-year agreement period. However, excluding labor, most input costs for automakers have declined since the pandemic peak, including steel, rubber, plastics, and glass. Just that the double-digit wage hikes in the UAW contract will weigh on total costs in 2024, offsetting some of the savings from input costs deflation.', 'Ample Inventory Aiding Sales but Ailing Margins: Post-pandemic supply chain disruptions have significantly eased, leading to a notable recovery in new vehicle inventory. According to estimates from J.D. Power and GlobalData, inventory levels reached approximately 1.7 million vehicles in March, marking a 4.2% increase from February and a 39% surge from March 2023.', 'This surplus inventory has prompted increased incentives and discounts for consumers, thereby addressing affordability concerns. However, these discounts are impacting the average selling price of vehicles, thereby squeezing the profit margins of firms.', 'E-Mobility Landscape: EV sales growth in the United States is decelerating due to a slower-than-anticipated pace of customer acceptance. In the first quarter of 2024, Americans purchased 268,909 new EVs, constituting 7.3% of total new vehicle sales, a decline from the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'Nonetheless, Cox Automotive projects a year-over-year increase in EV sales for 2024, aiming for roughly 10% market share by year-end.

But the focus on EVs and manufacturing stands out.', 'The White House earmarked billions via the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to boost EV adoption and charging and create an American manufacturing industrial complex to support EV production.', 'Biden’s move to protect his EV bet is not surprising. And the overall effect on the American consumer will initially be slim to none, as there are very few Chinese-made EVs for sale in America.', 'Currently, only Buick (GM), Lincoln (F), Lotus, Polestar (PSNY), and Volvo (VOLCAR-B.ST) ship vehicles made in China into the US, Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions noted to Yahoo Finance.', 'Of those cars, only Polestar imports a Chinese-made EV to the US. Lotus just started shipping its luxury EV in extremely limited quantities. In a statement, Polestar said it was ""evaluating"" Tuesday\'s announcement from the White House, noting that its upcoming Polestar 3 SUV will begin production in South Carolina this summer.', 'According to KBB, 1.2 million EVs were sold in America in 2023. Polestar does not break out its overall global sales by territory, but the company delivered 54,600 cars across territories like China, the EU, and the US last year. Even if a generous half of those vehicles are counted as US sales, the percentage of Chinese-made EVs sold in America is just over 2% of all EV sales.', '“The duty is unlikely to significantly impact the US auto market as relatively few Chinese EVs are being imported, and this new level will only further discourage buyers from turning to Chinese EVs,” Beacon Policy Advisors said in a note to clients.', '“The value for Biden, though, is the attention that nearly quadrupling the tariff grabs and provides the president a clear campaign talking point.”', 'And the auto industry’s main lobbying arm is, not surprisingly, backing the move.', '""[China has] got a major EV overcapacity problem. They’re building too many EVs — too many heavily subsidized EVs — for the domestic market and have no choice but to look abroad to offload those vehicles at budget prices. It’s happening already in Europe,"" said John Bozzella, president and CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation, in a statement Tuesday morning.', '""It’s appropriate for the White House to be looking at tools to prevent the US from becoming a dumping ground for subsidized Chinese EVs.""', 'The United Auto Workers, which endorsed Biden’s reelection campaign earlier this year, also applauded the president’s ""decisive"" action, calling it ""a major step in the right direction.""', 'Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown is even pushing Biden to go further, posting last week that tariffs aren\'t enough and ""we need to ban Chinese EVs from the US.""', 'Nonetheless, quadrupling import tariffs to 100% could severely dampen even those minimal sales. And the new duties may ultimately hurt the American consumer in ways beyond dealership sales.', '""Chinese EVs and batteries, along with solar products, will be excluded from the US market,"" free trade expert Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Yahoo Finance. ""The result will be higher US prices and slower uptake of climate-friendly technology. This is a regrettable price of the US-China Cold War and US presidential political dynamics.""', ""AutoForecast Solutions' Fiorani also believes these new tariffs will slow the advance of Chinese-made EVs in America, but there could be a backdoor."", '“Congress is looking to control the importation of vehicles by Chinese brands, but that will be difficult when they’re not made in China,” Fiorani said.', '“Establishing production facilities outside of China, especially in Mexico or South Korea, will be one of the possible methods of getting around basic legislation.”', 'Later this week, for instance, BYD will debut a new plug-in hybrid EV pickup that will be assembled in Mexico.', 'Advocates for tariffs believe protection from Chinese EV imports is necessary. Otherwise, American automakers will be overwhelmed by the competition, and a backdoor through Mexico could be the trigger.', 'Hufbauer also believes, however, that the tariffs are too extreme and likely overkill.', '“The US auto industry could certainly survive and even prosper if, say, Chinese EVs and batteries were limited to 15% of the market, rather than excluded,” Hufbauer said.', 'Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Gerard, please go ahead."", 'Gerard Barron', ""Thank you, Craig, and thank you to all of you for attending our first quarter 2024 corporate update conference call. It's only been a month and a half since our last update. But even in that short time, we've seen some important project milestones and positive tailwinds for this industry. But I'd like to start with an exciting new addition to the TMC team. Last month, we were pleased to welcome Steve Jurvetson to our Board as Vice Chairman and strategic adviser. Steve is not just a legendary investor, but a visionary with wide and deep ranging curiosity. Among other roles, he is a current Board member of SpaceX, and former longtime Board member of Tesla. His investments represented $800 billion in aggregate value creation and include pioneering technology companies like Tesla and Planet Labs and SpaceX and Commonwealth Fusion Systems. And I'm proud to count him both as a supporter of our mission and an exciting TMC shareholder, and we are already benefiting from his contributions and collections. So I'll do a quick liquidity snapshot. Total liquidity stood at $49 million as at March 31, 2024. Since that time, TMC has drawn down $2.9 million out of our $45 million available capacity on unsecured credit facilities. And the use of these facilities provided by our three largest shareholders, including myself, should indicate how confident we are on the path forward and the news flow in the coming months, which we believe will be well received by current and potential investors. The next slide is a summary since our last quarterly update in late March. I'd like to draw your attention to the news we announced this morning. We have now uploaded the largest ever submission of environmental data to the International Seabed Authority. Drawn from 22 offshore campaigns to the NORI-D area, this wealth of new data adds a further 75,000 biological occurrences to the ISA's catalog of contracted data for the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, as well as a myriad of other data which will further enhance society's understanding of the deep sea ecosystem and the potential impacts of our operations. NORI's dataset is the largest of its kind ever gathered in the deep sea, and with much more data still to come, I am confident that our efforts over the past 12 years will provide the regulator with the data it needs to make informed decisions regarding our application. And as we move onto the agenda, you'll see we spend some time today focusing more specifically on the key questions that we'll be answering with our environmental impact assessment, the results of our investment over the past decade are now arriving almost daily, and we remain very encouraged by what we see. We are excited to share some of this with you today, along with some insight on why our team is increasingly confident that there are no showstoppers. We will progress -- also review the industry headlines, provide an update on regulatory progress, and end with -- (technical difficulty)"", 'Craig Shesky', ""Hey, sorry about that. this is CFO, Craig Shesky. I'm going to continue with our slides until we're able to get our CEO and Chairman, Gerard Barron dialed back in. But this page we're looking at now is focusing on really what we've already achieved. And certainly while our ride as a public company has sometimes been rocky, we're increasingly confident that we've now weathered that storm and are in a much firmer financial footing. Even amidst that volatility, it's pretty amazing to look back and see everything that our team has been able to do. So going back to the beginning of 2021, we laid out what we wanted to achieve as a public company. And then we got to work and started checking off those boxes. For example, in early 2021, we put out two SEC compliant resource statements and an initial assessment of the NORI-D area signed off by AMC consultants, noting a net present value at the time of $6.8 billion. In late 2021, we completed our pyrometallurgical processing pilot, de-risking a flow sheet in advance of future onshore operations. And in 2022, we completed the first successful integrated pilot system tests in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone since the 1970s, lifting 3,000 wet tonnes of nodules and helping to derisk our future operations alongside our partner, Allseas. And as we discussed last quarter, we also finished the last of our 22 preproduction offshore campaigns, including the completion in late February of our environmental campaign one year following our pilot collection test. So we've also successfully pivoted to a capital-light model with the support of key partners like PAMCO onshore and Allseas offshore, which can provide production assets to us for our exclusive use and then, of course, reduce preproduction CapEx requirements to a bare minimum. So our attention is now laser-focused on the main prerequisites for the milestone of launching our application for an exploitation contract of the minority area, particularly our pre-feasibility study and our environmental impact statement. So from first principles, why are we interested in deep-sea floor nodules in the first place? Well, for starters, the deeper sea plane represents an area of the planet with the least life per square meter as measured by biomass, but also relatively low biodiversity. These nodules contain high grades four metals in one ore, and sourcing battery metals from nodules requires no digging or blasting, and produces near zero solid waste and no tailings. And for offshore, we don't have to displace any human communities nor build a costly infrastructure necessary to access mineral resources on land. And this is why we can take a capital-light approach, which is almost unheard of for resource projects. There is also a remarkable correlation between the nodules and mineral composition and the composition of EV battery cathodes in wiring. Rich in nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese, these nodules closely fit the requirements for the majority of the electric vehicle battery cathodes being sold today. And based on our continued conversations with major automakers, many new batteries are expected to continue to rely upon nickel-rich chemistries. And this is a very good time to remind you of our press release in early April, demonstrating we can turn nodules into nickel sulfate, indicative of battery market suitability, pending confirmation of those preliminary assays. And yes, even though EV outlooks have softened in recent months, the metallic composition nodules mean they're also remarkably suited for use in diverse other applications across the energy infrastructure and defense sectors. And this is where it's so advantageous to have a basket of metal products, each of which has exposure to sectors, which will be geopolitically critical in the coming decades. Whether it's the generation of nuclear power, the production of steel for use in infrastructure, wind turbines and the like, or in alloys for both commercial and defense sectors, nickel has numerous competing uses. Likewise, cobalt is garnering increasing interest for its use in production of hydrogen and use of hydrogen fuel cells as well as other defense applications. And of course, copper and manganese have underpinned nearly all global infrastructure in place today, and that will be built up in the future as we look to meet the needs of the industrialization of the developing world and multibillion global population growth. Already this quarter, copper prices have increased by 17%, driven in part by expectations of data center needs for powering AI. And prices for manganese this quarter, our second most important product, are up by nearly 30%. So as we've said many times before, our resource truly is an outlier among the world's nickel projects, and not only a non-oriental ranked by mining.com and the largest 200 nickel projects in the world, but the nickel equivalent grade of the resource is truly remarkable. And after a very rough 2023 in the nickel market due to low cost supply from the -- underneath the Indonesian rainforest, nickel prices have begun to stabilize and are now up 18% so far in the second quarter. With a nickel equivalent grade over 3% and four key metals in one resource, TMC is able to withstand commodity price volatility better than a typical project, and provide alternatives to the portion of the nickel market controlled and funded by China and Russia. And as noted on the previous slide, we are levered to metal market that each have a significant application in the defense sector amidst an increasingly tenuous global order. So at a time of heightened geopolitical competition, there's a lot of media coverage that's been devoted to the ongoing visit by President Xi of China to France. And one aspect to President Xi's visit which flew under the radar was the acquired publication of a joint China-France declaration in which both parties committed themselves to remaining engaged in the development of regulations at the ISA and support for ongoing environmental impact assessments to support evidence-based decision-making. France has flip-flopped on its support for this industry in the past, and the softened language on display in this joint statement reflects an interesting development in its stance, perhaps suggesting that the French government is now taking seriously its obligations that are on class and that China's favorable view of this industry is rubbing off on France rather than the other way around. Gerard, I see that you're back. If you'd like to (multiple speakers) -- we're on page 14."", 'Gerard Barron', ""Technical issues have been resolved. My apologies for that. So taking the mantle back up, so there's been a steady pace of news out of China on seafloor mining over the past few years, culminating in the Washington Post piece in October regarding Chinese keen interest in deep sea floor resources. While also acknowledging TMC's leadership role in this industry, Chinese urgency in this space has accelerated in the last several weeks with not one but two contractors submitting environmental impact statements to conduct nodule collection tests in 2025. There is still much work ahead for the Chinese contractors, and we do not expect commercial production from them before the early 2030s. But certainly, these actions from China regarding deep sea floor resources are sounding alarm bells in Washington DC. As reported in the Wall Street Journal in March, a bill aimed at providing support for domestic nodule collection processing and refining has been introduced by members of the House of Representatives, titled the Responsible Use of Seafloor Resources Act. Also in March, over 350 former political and military leaders, including Hillary Clinton urged the US Senate to ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty. Of course, I'm sure many of you are interested in the timing of the delivery of a report by the Pentagon to the House Armed Services Committee, assessing the opportunities offered by nodules to diversify critical mineral supply chains away from China. And we are quite interested in the date of this report as well. The Pentagon is continuing its detailed analysis, and while we do not have certainty on the date of the report's completion, the tone and tenor of the work seems to be very encouraging. And further, we're in active dialogue with members of Congress regarding the prioritization of feasibility work for the future refining of nodule-derived products in the United States, building on the existing base of support demonstrated in last year's National Defense Authorization Act. So we look forward to sharing more developments on this front in the coming weeks and months. Despite activist efforts to sway OEMs, we were encouraged this month to see two of the world's largest car companies and EV heavyweights, Tesla and General Motors, stand up for evidenced-based decision making and recommend the rejection of proposals to support a moratorium. And we hold firmly to the belief that all projects, whether on land or on the deep sea floor, must be judged by merits, and we remain confident in the clear advantages offered by the nodule resource. And of course, as benchmark found in the recent LCA of NORI-D project, nodules would outperform key land-based production routes for nickel, cobalt, representing 90% of global supply and copper, 20% of global supply in almost every impact category analyzed. But again, this will not be a one-size-fit-all situation. The needs of the energy transition will require a mosaic approach where all options remain on the table to be judged on their merits, based on science rather than activism. I'd now like to play a short video on that environmental work and then turn the call over to Craig to take you through some detail on the NORI-D project."", ""(video starts) Developing the NORI-D nodule project without causing serious harm to the marine environment is a core objective for The Metals Company and a prerequisite for the International Seabed Authority to permit commercial production. This is why the Environmental Impact Statement or EIS is the largest and arguably most important component of the NORI-D exploitation application to the ISA. Our environmental impact statement is the outcome of a decade-long exploration work program that started with our first offshore campaign in 2012. Since then, we have executed a total of 22 environmental campaign, spending 507 days on site in the NORI-D area. This work program was executed in collaboration with researchers from the world's leading marine institutions and expert industry contractors. Over 100 studies have been conducted in total. First, to characterize the marine environment on the NORI-D area, also known as environmental baseline, and then to monitor how this environment was impacted by our pilot technology to collect nodules from the seafloor and lift them to the surface. This scope and depth of research for an environmental impact assessment for a natural resource project is unprecedented. On-land EIAs for resource projects typically focus on the largest and most vulnerable species that exist above ground with little consideration for smaller organisms like microbes and biodiversity belowground. In the ocean, we investigate biological communities that exist throughout the water column from the largest mammals and fish in the uppermost sunlight zone to the microscopic organisms that live in the sediment and make up the majority of living biomass at the abyssal seafloor. How do we make sense of the hundreds of terabytes of environmental data collected in the NORI-D area? Based on a public consultation with deep-sea researchers, NORI structured the assessment around five key potential impacts, each investigated by a team of specialist researchers: One, plumes; two noise; three eco-toxicity; four, biodiversity; and five, CO2. Each part of the assessment required thousands of hours of high-tech equipment deployment, data capture, and intensive analysis. All underlying environmental data are shared with public databases like the ISA's deep data and UNESCO's OBIS database on marine biodiversity. Once completed and submitted as part of our exploitation application for the NORI-D nodule project, the EIS will provide the International Seabed Authority with a science-based assessment of the impact of our proposed operations enabling the regulator to make informed decisions. (video ends)"", 'Craig Shesky', ""And that video is available in our slide deck posted on our website for anybody that may have had video freezing issues. Apologies for that. But certainly the accumulation of baseline data over the last decade-plus does represent the most comprehensive deep-sea dataset ever collected in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. And it was collected in partnership with many of the world's leading marine research institutions and expert industry contractors. And this dataset is generating a lot of excitement among the researchers who have truly acknowledge the rigor and the scale of this science program. This deep data is openly shared to public databases including the ISA's deep data library of contractor data as well as other open source databases like UNESCO's ocean biodiversity information system or OBIS, the world's largest catalog of marine organisms. Our environmental impact assessment has a very specific focus to assess the potential impacts of our operations on marine biodiversity and ecosystem functions. To this end, our team identified six primary concerns related to our operations for further investigation based on discussions with stakeholders. And thanks to these efforts, a far more in-depth understanding of our expected impacts is emerging and that contradicts much of the speculation by activists and some of the media. Off the back of our 2022 test pilot collection, we've now seen the infield observed data showing that 92% to 98% of sediment mobilized at the seafloor stays within two meters of the seafloor and settles locally. This finding is critically important as it addresses speculation that sediment plumes could travel tens of thousands of kilometers or could rise up four kilometers to the surface and impact climate change. As noted on last quarter's call, when we did a deep dive within the sea floor, including data, this is a clear example of why the speculation of opposition groups was very wrong and in-field observed data needs to take precedence over such speculation. We've also made significant strides in assessing the impacts of noise from our test mining and last week received a comprehensive report from HR Wallingford, which outlined how the underwater noise model they have been developing predicts that impairment to the hearing of marine mammals does not occur beyond the distance of 20 meters from the nodule collection activity under the assumption that the animals can swim away. Even without that assumption, the temporary threshold shift as predicted between 20 and 1,100 meters from the mining and permanent threshold shift between 10 and 65 meters. And given that whales don't dive within thousands of meters of our planned nodule collection, we view this as very good news and are very confident that noise concerns will not be a significant impediment. And while some claim that nodule collection would irreversibly destroys abyssal habitats, the reality is that such operations would result in the transformation of patches of seafloor from one habitat type that is ubiquitous in the deep-sea to another. Even assuming that all current exploration contracts proceeded to production, only 0.18% of the global seafloor would be transformed in this way. And as our recent offshore campaigns to assess ecosystem recovery showed, life has begun returning to those areas most directly impacted by sentiment plumes within a year. And several of those primary concerns I just went through are interrelated. For example, if the seafloor food is limited, as we know it is, it also limits the potential impact on seafloor biodiversity and the relatively low amount of carbon stored in seafloor sediment. As noted above, we now know that 92% to 98% of sediment mobilized at the seafloor rises no more than a couple of meters and settles within hours or days. And as a result, there is no known pathway for this negligible amount of carbon to make its way 4 kilometers up to the surface and reach the atmosphere. And our oceans do indeed store significant amounts of carbon, but less than 5% of this carbon is contained in seafloor sediments. And despite covering almost 90% of the global ocean area. Abyssal planes account for a fraction of the total carbon locked away in seafloor sediments, none of which appears to be available for microbial conversion to CO2. As the true environmental impacts of nodule collection become clear, thanks to the wealth of emerging data, activists may continue to spread misinformation, but it's going to be the actual in-field observed data that matters to the adults in the room who will be making these key permitting decisions, which brings us to the regulatory update. We were very encouraged by the progress at the most recent ISA meeting in Jamaica, in line with the positive commentary on this industry's inevitability from Secretary General Michael Lodge to CNBC earlier this year. The current President of the ISA council, Mr. Olav Myklebust of Norway spoke to the substantive advancements made during the March session in his closing remarks, quote, I'm very pleased with the progress made by the Council. We are moving forward with the development of regulations on the exploitation of deep seabed minerals with strong environmental protection at a good pace, unquote. And as noted in our last call, the consolidated regulatory text was released in late February, signaling the transition to the final phase of mining code negotiations. And we, at TMC, continue to intend to launch our application for an exploitation contract over the NORI-D area at some point following this year's July ISA meeting. One of the key decisions on our application is the recommendation from the Legal and Technical Commission or LTC. And the individuals of the LTC reviewed the application, they were all subject matter experts. If consensus on an approval recommendations that reached, the decision is made by simple majority vote. And if the LTC recommends approval, the Council reviews and if acceptable, approves the recommendation. Two-thirds majority of the ISA council would be needed to overturn a positive LTC recommendation. And certainly, we expect plenty of back-and-forth and questions from the LTC, both before and following our application. But we feel very good about our ability to have the application stand on its merits during what will be a very well thought out and thorough review process. So onto the project economics. In March 2021, AMC consultants issued SEC Reg S- K 1300 compliant initial assessment of the project economics for the NORI-D area. The initial assessments available in the Investors section of our website as are the resource statements for both NORI and TOML. Initial assessment arrived at the net present value of $6.8 billion for NORI-D at the beginning of last -- excuse me, at the beginning of 2021. Running the same model solely updated for current metal prices, the net present value of NORI-D would be approximately $11.5 billion and our current market cap would represent just about 4% of that number, despite the very significant milestones already achieved on a project that's less than two years away from expected commercial production and still a huge discount to pure nickel or copper developers at this stage of preproduction. Now going through the financial results. In the first quarter of 2024, TMC reported a net loss of $25.2 million or $0.08 per share compared to TMC's net loss of $13.7 million, or $0.05 per share for the same period in 2023. The net loss for the first quarter of 2024 including exploration and evaluation expenses of $18.1 million versus $7.2 million in Q1 2023. General and administrative expenses of $6.6 million and versus $6.2 million in Q1 2023. Exploration and evaluation expenses increased by $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This significant increase is primarily due to an increase in mining, technological, and process development of $10.5 million, specifically tied to the increased geotechnical work, which was the majority of the costs incurred this quarter for offshore Campaign 8B, which concluded in February. Plus some additional expenses incurred on the transportation of nodules to PAMCO's facility in Japan, and some higher personnel costs. This is partially offset by a decrease in environmental study costs as the cost for campaigning, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023 was completed in the first quarter this year. General and administrative expenses increased slightly by $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase is due to higher amortization of share-based comp and higher consulting fees offset by lower legal costs. In the first quarter of 2024, the net cash used in operating activities amounted to $11.9 million compared to $23.5 million for the first quarter of 2023. The large gap between the net loss for Q1 2024 and the net cash used in operating activities for the same period is due to share-based compensation and expense settled with equity and some changes in working capital. The free cash flow for the first quarter of 2024 was negative $12.1 million compared to negative $23.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, and I'd point you to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in the slide deck and on our website. Regarding the balance sheet, as at March 31, 2024, we closed the quarter with $4.0 million in cash. And as we noted, we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from today. So I'm now going to turn it back over to our Chairman and CEO, Gerard Barron for some closing remarks. And then from that point, we will take some questions both on the phone line as well as the webcast. Gerard, back over to you."", 'Gerard Barron', ""Yeah, thank you, Craig. As I said at our earnings press release, 2024 is the year when we expect most of the activist driven speculation about the environmental impacts of our emerging industry will be displaced by data and evidence. We're encouraged that an increasing number of countries and automakers are showing the courage to keep this transformational resource on the table. And in the meantime, our executive team will continue the work of securing strategic partnerships while keeping our eye firmly focused on the date of first production, which marches ever closer. I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to my TMC team, including our partners and contractors and of course, to our sponsoring states. And thanks to everyone who tuned in for your interest and attention. And with that, we'd like to turn it back to the operator for some Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)', 'Craig Shesky', ""As those questions are being compiled, we can take a question from Eric Goldstein on the webcast. I'll put this to you first, Gerard, and then I can weigh in as well. How do we expect the ISA meetings to go this year? Specifically, what do we expect in the July meeting, and the [$40,000] question, when are all the rules and regs going to be passed?"", 'Gerard Barron', 'Sure. Look, we are expecting solid progress. When the ISA meets again, of course, it will be the legal and technical commission, the Council and the Assembly meeting. And so what we are looking for is progress. And of course, we had the legal right to lodge our application. We notified the market that we would not lodge an application until after the July session this year, and before the end of 2024. And so we know that there is an enormous amount of work happening intercessionally. And I think what we are encouraged by is that the regulations now that there is a consolidated text that was debated back in the March session, is drawing to a -- what we think is a robust final version.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Malcolm MacDonald, BofA.', 'Malcolm MacDonald', ""Hey guys. You know who is pushing this moratorium to Tesla and GM is an NGO. That's number one. Number two, if you could comment on Biden's Chinese EV tariffs today and Trump's subsequent comments and with regards how that affects the Inflation Reduction Act; specifically how it reflects to Tesla and GM? And then lastly what is the timeline for the Chinese entities that are -- as you mentioned earlier in the call, that are expected to conduct tests next year versus your timeline and if the United States wanted to get in the game independently, how late are they?"", 'Craig Shesky', ""Yeah. Look, so specifically starting with the shareholder proposals for GM and Tesla, the one for Tesla is specifically, they're called As You Sow. But look, for both GM and Tesla, we don't want to get into who's behind each of them, but yeah, it's NGO-driven. We also view it as very anti-science to effectively say, as all of this new data has been coming through, as Gerard said, almost on a daily basis. Some people are now recognizing that it's not confirming their previously held belief, almost the definition of confirmation bias. So because of that, you're now seeing a push for something like this to be taken off the table at a time when many other automakers are being forced to invest elsewhere in rainforest nickel, which puts them in difficult position. So we think the science will continue to speak for itself. And frankly, we're very heartened by the fact that the Boards of both Tesla and GM recommended voting no against such proposals that we take clearly viable options off the table."", 'Gerard Barron', ""And on the China front, we -- of course, they are planning to launch an application to be able to do a collective trial next year. And so that will take a year for the regulator to opine on that. And if I reflect on our own application, it was a big heavy lift. It's required a lot of work. And that means they need to receive the approval to go and do that and then they need to go and do it. And so I think what the Chinese contractors have said quite openly is that they expect to be in production on the other side of this decade. And so there's a lot of work. We were very fortunate to have a collective trial that ran so successfully in 2022, involved our first production vessel, the hidden gem. And as you know, we're getting that vessel ready for first production and we remain on track for that in 2026. So there is no doubt that we hold a competitive edge over all of the other contractors, including China. And that's a great opportunity for Western economies like the United States. Now, tariffs to protect the automakers? Look, I don't really want to comment on that too much other than the Inflation Reduction Act was really intended to bring jobs in industry and secure supply lines and raw materials for American industry. And I think that and there have been some uses of those funds, which potentially have simply, I guess, driven demand for electric vehicles, but have they really driven jobs in the United States? And so what I think is there's a great opportunity and whether it's either of the names you mentioned as the future president of the United States. I think there will be more focus on how do you build jobs and how do you help those economies build independence and you can't do that without raw materials, without battery materials. And so we're encouraged, as I said earlier, in the messaging that we're hearing out of DC. We continue to talk to relevant parties there. We continue to answer questions as they are asked. And based on the conversations that we're lucky enough to be part of, we're encouraged. And so the Inflation Reduction Act will hopefully be a very good thing. Some materials that are derived from polymetallic nodules, particularly those that TMC have their hands on."", 'Craig Shesky', ""Yeah. I might also comment on that Malcolm, that we noted upfront really on slide 11, which I will pull up now as folks are able to see it -- you really can't get away from the fact that nodules are composed in such a manner that lines up not just with EVs, which is the focus of that question, but also so many other applications that are experiencing demand tailwinds, which you can't really change, of course, is some of the supply realities. And even taking nickel, for example, nickel grades have declined over time. Copper grades have declined over time. It becomes more and more difficult to find new high-quality high-grade deposits of some of these metals on land. The change of that occurs, sometimes when you have a large new source like what you saw from Indonesian nickel supply over the last decade. But even Indonesia announced that at this point, let's say, next decade, we're going to be running quite low on some of the higher grade reserves and there are going to be opportunities for nodules, given how much we've seen smelter capacity get built out. So the reality is certainly on the demand side, would be inflation reduction and acting on tariffs on EVs, perhaps some comments from Trump noting the things that he would do with the Inflation Reduction Act. That's all quite marginal when it comes to the global demand for these metals and having this basket of very attractive commodities allows us to withstand fluctuations in a way that many land-based operators just aren't able to do."", 'Malcolm MacDonald', ""Thanks. So basically, to just square the circle here, the US is behind, China is trying to get ahead, but you guys are in first place. And in order for the US to compete with China, they're going to have to partner with someone like yourself."", 'Gerard Barron', ""Will that is their opportunity? That's for sure."", 'Malcolm MacDonald', 'Thanks, guys.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Frank Jones, Norbury Partners', 'Frank Jones', ""Hey, guys. Great update as usual. Two questions for me. First one, pretty quick, I think I know the answer, but just confirming. On a liquidity front, you mentioned we're good for 12 months meeting capital needs and just want to make sure that's inclusive of application demands. And I guess in that, I should read that major exploration and evaluation expenses are behind us? And then the second one I ask this every time, but I know by the next time we have one of these calls, the pre-feasibility work will probably be out so any guidance on timing for that? And with that, the final agreements with PAMCO and Allseas and what those splits look like?"", 'Craig Shesky', ""Yeah, sure. Starting with those questions, I mean, let's start with the last one on the pre-feasibility side. Yeah, we're pushing very hard on that. We're very encouraged. Our teams have been in Japan and the Netherlands, respectively, in the last month. So there's a lot of on-the-groundwork and cooperation which just shows how committed not only our team is, but the teams of our partners. So yes, we are not changing any update on timing or guidance on that front. You did note in terms of us having the liquidity necessary to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, that's an analysis done on committed costs. But what I would draw you to is the typical guidance that we provide, which we're happy to reiterate that what we need to launch the application at some point following the July 2024 session of the ISA is an incremental $35 million to $45 million. You can then reduce that dollar for dollar for what we drew upon our credit facility, $2.9 million. So that range that we came out with really two quarters ago -- actually more than two quarters ago, we'd continue to reiterate because the spending necessary to launch that application has been under tight controls by our team. So what I would say is keep that range in mind, and it's a range that is less than the total liquidity options that we have available to us, even though that may not be our ultimate choice on how we fund that next stage getting into production."", 'Frank Jones', 'Got it. Super helpful. Thank you, both.', 'Craig Shesky', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. I'm currently showing no further questions over the phone line at this time. I'd now like to turn it back to Craig Shesky."", 'Craig Shesky', ""We got a couple more actually, and I'm happy to take a few on the webcast. There is a question from Rich Wesolowski: does the company need the US Senate to ratify the UN Convention to succeed? The answer there is no. It's really to us a sign of the increased commitment from the US to the space, but also the recognition that the US truly should have a seat at the table in how this very important industry is going to be regulated. And what we laid out in today's update was the actions of a lot of countries we showed on the slide in addition to the France-China joint statement, the new deep-sea mining legislation from Belgium, that builds upon the deep sea exploration news coming out of Norway earlier this year and then pending environmental work, potentially deep sea exploitation in Norwegian territorial waters. There are just a lot of very large populous, credible industrial countries, and that includes India, and China, Japan and now the United States that are very interested in this industry. And frankly, if the US chose not to ratify the UN Convention and not take their full seat at the table at the ISA, it just continues to underscore that the only real way they can get access to this resource would be through a contractor like TMC. And I think we have time for one more question. There is a question coming in from an anonymous investor: can we talk, Gerard, about where you're spending your time in terms of strategic partnerships? Any updates on those efforts on the strategic fronts and where our time is going to be spent in the coming months?"", 'Gerard Barron', ""Well, I could share my diary, of course. That would be quite revealing. Look in the last six months in particular, we've spent a lot of time in Asia and mainly in Indonesia. And we're fascinated with Indonesia, of course, because it's where all of the growth in nickel material is coming from. Unfortunately, it's coming from nickel laterites, but they have built a very strong processing industry to be able to process those materials. And as we know, you can process our polymetallic nodules with that same infrastructure answer. And so it's a very interesting opportunity for us. And there are some very strong cooperations there who are heavily involved in nickel. The Indonesian Government are trying to build out a battery materials supply chain even more extensively than they have now, by building battery refining. We saw companies like BYD announcing that they're actually going to build cars there. And so there's no doubt things are moving in that country. But Asia is certainly a very friendly place for TMC right now. And we see tremendous opportunity, of course, by sending our nodules to places like Indonesia. We do believe that we can slow down the expansion of some of that nickel laterite resource development and replace rainforest nickel with nodules. And that's going to be a good thing for the planet. And it seems that that message is being well received in that country. And of course, by being able to utilize that existing infrastructure means that we can toll our modules through some of those processing plants, which means that we don't have to go and spend money to build processing. My team and I were recently up in Japan. We've just had 2,000 tonnes of nodules arrive with our partner, PAMCO. And that's a company that's been processing nickel ores since the 1960s. They're an amazingly competent partner for us and perfect to get us started. So there are many opportunities around that region getting things done in Europe is harder, of course, and we do remain hopeful that in North America, our efforts in DC will be recognized. I don't think we'll ever build a pyrometallurgical plant in the USA. But I do believe that we can send our intermediate product into the USA for further refining into battery materials. And so we are continuing to make efforts in that area."", 'Craig Shesky', ""Yeah, and that makes sense, too. And just adding a little color to you on the pyrometallurgical side. That focus on the refining of intermediate products potentially in the United States is firmly in line with the DC strategy we've been deploying this year. And as a lot of focus is on National Defense Authorization Act coming out this year, there continues to be a lot of support for feasibility work on something like that. And frankly, it makes perfect sense so that the US avoids falling further behind. So that's all the time that we have today. But we appreciate all of you taking the time to join us, and we're certainly looking forward to sharing more progress on the next quarterly call. And for those of you who are already shareholders, we're looking forward to speaking to you at our Annual General Meeting. So thank you very much. And I turn it back over to the operator."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.""]"

Normalization of supply chains has boosted inventory levels but margins are under pressure due to heightened consumer discounts.Although electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to increase this year, it will require more effort from companies to drive sales due to a slower-than-expected pace of adoption, underscoring the need for the industry to navigate evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics. Two industry participants — General Motors GM and Blue Bird Corporation BLBD — are well-positioned to drive gains to your portfolio.', 'Industry Overview', 'The Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.', 'Key Factors at Play', 'Vehicle Sales Growth to Decelerate: New vehicle sales in the United States rose 5.1% in the first quarter of 2024 backed by strong inventory, incentives and healthy fleet volumes. The seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter came in at 15.4 million, implying a year-over-year uptick of 2.7%. While vehicle sales are projected to grow in 2024, inflationary pressure, high costs of borrowing and an uncertain macro environment are expected to influence purchase decisions and slow down the pace of growth rate relative to 2023.', 'Manufacturing Costs Dynamics: The UAW agreement reached in 2023 is set to raise labor costs for all automakers as the firms aim to stay competitive in attracting and retaining talent. General Motors and Ford anticipate a roughly $9 billion increase in costs over the four-year agreement period. However, excluding labor, most input costs for automakers have declined since the pandemic peak, including steel, rubber, plastics, and glass. Just that the double-digit wage hikes in the UAW contract will weigh on total costs in 2024, offsetting some of the savings from input costs deflation.', 'Ample Inventory Aiding Sales but Ailing Margins: Post-pandemic supply chain disruptions have significantly eased, leading to a notable recovery in new vehicle inventory. According to estimates from J.D. Power and GlobalData, inventory levels reached approximately 1.7 million vehicles in March, marking a 4.2% increase from February and a 39% surge from March 2023. This surplus inventory has prompted increased incentives and discounts for consumers, thereby addressing affordability concerns. However, these discounts are impacting the average selling price of vehicles, thereby squeezing the profit margins of firms.', 'E-Mobility Landscape: EV sales growth in the United States is decelerating due to a slower-than-anticipated pace of customer acceptance. In the first quarter of 2024, Americans purchased 268,909 new EVs, constituting 7.3% of total new vehicle sales, a decline from the fourth quarter of 2023. Nonetheless, Cox Automotive projects a year-over-year increase in EV sales for 2024, aiming for roughly 10% market share by year-end. To achieve this, the EV market anticipates an influx of new models, incentives, discounts, and advertising. However, dealers will need to exert more effort to bolster sales in the face of evolving consumer preferences.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Holds Promise', 'The Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is part of the broader Zacks\xa0Auto-Tires-Trucks\xa0sector.

Forbes recently released a video where OpenAI's first investor, Vinod Khosla, mentioned he believes it will be robotics. A similar sentiment is also shared by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, which he mentioned in an interview on CNBC a year ago. In fact, Huang specifically mentioned robotic surgery as one of the potentially highly accretive sectors of the not-too-distant future, where AI meets the physical world more noticeably."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ISRG.', 'I agree that one of the industries that robotics will be able to most powerfully transform is health care, particularly surgical operations. The reason I believe this is it will be increasingly more viable for lower-risk, robotics-assisted surgeries to eventually become the norm. Indeed, this is already happening and one of the companies leading the way is Intuitive Surgical Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG).', ""Founded in 1995, Intuitive Surgical was publicly listed in 2000. It has become famous in the health care industry for offering surgeons a lower-risk, more precise surgical method, which is minimally invasive and also primarily performed by robotic endpoints touching the patient's body. The surgeon stands behind a screen with 3D vision separate from the operating table, akin to operating remotely."", ""The company's most well-known product is called the da Vinci surgical system, which is sold to hospitals and surgical centers. The company also offers various instruments and accessories that are compatible with da Vinci systems. Notably, a lot of the instruments are single-use or have a limited number of uses, which has developed a recurring revenue model for Intuitive Surgical; servicing, surgeon training and software updates also help contribute to this. Another prominent revenue driver is its system called Ion Endoluminal, which is designed for minimally invasive biopsies of the lung."", 'Intuitive Surgical is the largest robotic surgery company in the world with a market cap of $135.87 billion at the time of writing. As such, it is arguably positioned to capitalize extremely well off of the growing trend in AI, automation and robotics. I believe one day it will be possible for surgery to be able to be performed fully autonomously, with human supervision. I believe this will not only be more cost-effective, but also safer, less invasive and more precise. The reason I say this is that with highly advanced AI integrated into these systems, robotic surgery has the potential to have fuller vision and use movements in operations that humans simply do not have access to.', ""At this stage, the da Vinci system is about as close to this as we can get, and it seems to be doing an exceptional job of integrating the technology available with the comfort levels of health care professionals, adhering to regulatory compliance and rigorous training standards for surgeons. Additionally, Intuitive Surgical now has its brand very well-established, predominantly in the United States, but also outside of it. It is growing a moat in the sense that hospitals and surgical centers are already heavily invested in Intuitive Surgical's equipment. All the company has to do is continue to evolve its offerings at a competitive rate and hospitals will be both wise and financially prudent to continue with Intuitive Surgical as a dominant equipment provider. The main risk here, which I will expand on later, is that new, more advanced developments are brought to market by a competitor, which might include more fully autonomous and deeper AI-assisted services, significantly reducing the competitive value of systems like da Vinci as they currently stand."", 'One of the financial elements that I am most impressed by with Intuitive Surgical is it carries no typical debt. As such, its balance sheet is in immensely good shape, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.88. The company is so well structured in this regard that it has not had any debt as far back as 2004. I believe this places the company in a very strong position. Not only is it much more secure in the case of recessions, but it is well-prepared to take on any reasonable amount of debt it might consider in the future to fund advancements in autonomous surgery and AI assistance that could keep its competitive advantage intact.', ""Additionally, the company has extremely high growth. Its three-year revenue growth rate is 18.20%, while its three-year earnings per share without nonrecurring items growth rate, which is perhaps the most important, is an even larger 24.80%. The consensus analyst estimates for the company's earnings growth rate are also strong, with a compound annual growth rate expected of 14.45% from 2023 until 2026."", ""Most investors do not dispute the attraction of Intuitive Surgical, based primarily on the excellence and moat in operations I outlined above, and the two core financial elements presented. However, where people are rationally deterred is the company's valuation. At the time of writing, Intuitive Surgical has a price-earnings ratio of almost 70 and a forward price-earnings ratio of around 61. This is rationally unsettling for some investors, and it does present some reasonable concern about the speculative nature of an investment in Intuitive Surgical as it is trading much higher than what would be deemed intrinsic value by a discounted earnings model."", 'Consider the following as a reference point. In a discounted earnings model, I estimated a 17.50% earnings per share without NRI CAGR for the next 10 years, a 4% earnings per share without NRI CAGR for the 10 years following that, as it is in line with U.S. inflation, and a 10% discount rate, as that is my low-end total portfolio return expectation. The intrinsic value alluded to is $165, while the stock price is $383 at the time of writing.', 'However, investors should remember Intuitive Surgical has traded at a median price-earnings ratio of 51 over the past 10 years. With the future looking evermore hinged on automation and robotics, I believe the higher demand we are likely to see for da Vinci systems sustained over the long-term future compared to historically elicits a higher price-earnings ratio at this time. From my analysis, and in line with what the GF Value chart depicts, it is reasonable to consider Intuitive Surgical fairly valued.', 'This competitive analysis will act as a litmus test on two measures. First, how well Intuitive Surgical appears compared to its dominant peers at this time. Second, it will act as a more future-oriented risk analysis that deciphers how Intuitive Surgical may fare in speculative but reasonable future scenarios that could place competitive pressure on the company and, in turn, reduce shareholder returns, which may be exacerbated by the already high valuation.', ""For instance, Medtronic's (NYSE:MDT) Hugo system is similar to Intuitive's da Vinci system, but offers more flexibility in operational capability, a deeper emphasis on the capability of collaboration between surgeons and a more comprehensive digital platform. The Hugo system is a newer entrant, and in many respects, even if it is better in some regards, the da Vinci system has a moat in being the first mover in the field. As I mentioned earlier, it is very unlikely for hospitals that are established with Intuitive Surgical to transfer providers unless the value added is remarkably high because of all of the associated costs."", ""Additionally, Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) launched the Ottava robotic system, which offers six arms, a notable step up from the typical four arms in robotic surgery systems, including da Vinci. Again, the da Vinci systems have been in use since the late 1990s, and the Ottava system was only announced in 2019. I believe Ottava's iteration is not pronounced enough to offer the significant competitive advantage that would disrupt Intuitive Surgical's long-term moat."", 'Looking to the future, there are many newer startups, including CRM Surgical, Vicarious Surgical (NYSE:RBOT) and Activ Surgical, which are offering advanced AI and machine learning assistance in robotic surgery. However, developing fully autonomous surgery is a challenge, primarily as a result of regulatory hurdles and a shift required in public sentiment about safety. Even the very established companies I have mentioned above, including da Vinci, employ AI to some degree. However, this is the largest risk I can see for the da Vinci system and Intuitive Surgical moving forward. If new players provide more advanced technology, which paves the way for or eventually provides fully autonomous surgery, I believe the market for da Vinci systems will begin to wane unless it rapidly adapts accordingly. The good news is the company is well positioned at the cross-section of technology and surgery to be ready to make the necessary shifts. However, it takes a careful restructuring gradually away from core mechanics toward a deeper emphasis on machine and deep learning capabilities, which requires more software and program development, including applications, which evidently will require different skill sets to what da Vinci is used to and prepared for. If the company does not understand this threat enough, I believe the investment case may lose its attractiveness over the long term.', 'Intuitive Surgical offers investors an extremely well-established moat in robotic surgery, with high initial purchase prices and a recurring revenue model. It is well positioned if it acts carefully to capitalize on the coming deeper emphasis on physical AI systems in the global economy.', 'The company is positioned well financially, with no debt and a remarkably strong balance sheet. It is also a high-growth enterprise. Investors just need to be careful of the valuation, as if future results do not prove as promising as now expected due to competitive threats coming to fruition, the stock price could meet a significant correction.', ""Its immediate competition does not look too daunting.

Though commodities like gold and oil, along with housing and Treasury bonds, have produced positive nominal returns for investors, none of these other asset classes have come close to delivering the annualized returns that stocks have generated over the last century.', ""With the three major stock indexes recently hitting fresh all-time highs, some investors might be leery of putting new money to work on Wall Street. But with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite eventually (key word!) erasing every notable downturn they've had throughout history, anytime can be the ideal moment to invest if you have a long-term mindset."", 'Putting your money to work on Wall Street is especially fruitful given that most online brokers have removed barriers that had previously kept retail investors on the sidelines. More specifically, minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for common stock trades on major U.S. stock exchanges are now a thing of the past. This means any amount of money -- even $500 -- can be the perfect amount to put to work on Wall Street.', ""If you have $500 that's ready to invest, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergencies as they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", ""The first exceptional business that makes for a surefire buy if you have $500 that's ready to be put to work on Wall Street is payment-processing leader Visa (NYSE: V)."", ""Every publicly traded company has headwinds it contends with, and Visa's is simply that it's cyclical. This is to say that it ebbs-and-flows with the health of the U.S. and global economy. If the U.S. were to dip into a recession, aggregate spending and the total number of transactions facilitated by Visa would be expected to decline. At the moment, a couple of predictive indicators, including a meaningful drop in U.S. M2 money supply, suggest there's a real possibility for a downturn in the U.S. economy."", ""Thankfully, the economic cycle is a two-sided coin that's not proportionate. Since World War II ended in 1945, nine of 12 U.S. recessions were resolved in less than a year, while the remaining three failed to surpass 18 months in length. Most periods of economic growth stick around for years, which allows Visa to take advantage of a steady ramp in aggregate consumer and enterprise spending."", ""Something else to add to the above is that Visa's management team has kept the company focused solely on payment facilitation. While some of its payment-processing peers double dip and also generate interest income as lenders, these companies endure the added risk of credit delinquencies and loan losses during recessions. Visa doesn't have to worry about setting capital aside to cover loan losses during short-lived economic downturns, which is a key reason why it's able to sustain a profit margin of greater than 50%!"", 'Despite its size (a $574 billion market cap), Visa has such an extensive growth runway beyond the borders of the U.S. that it should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate. Cross-border volume in the March-ended quarter surged 16%, which speaks to just how underbanked most emerging markets are. Visa has the abundant operating cash flow needed to organically or acquisitively expand its infrastructure in fast-growing emerging markets.', 'Further, Visa is the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. No other payment processor grew its share more than Visa following the Great Recession.', ""The second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought right now by opportunistic investors with $500 is cybersecurity company Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA)."", 'The biggest obstacle Okta will have to overcome is a security breach the company experienced late last year. Okta had to own up to the fact that hackers accessed sensitive information from its platform. While breaches are less than ideal for a company whose sole purpose is to protect against them, there are, nevertheless, multiple reasons for patient investors to be excited about the future.', ""On a broader scale, cybersecurity is effectively a basic need service for any business that has an online or cloud-based presence. Robots and hackers don't care how well or poorly the economy and/or the stock market are performing. They want sensitive information and will stop at nothing to get it. The responsibility of protecting this data is increasingly falling to third-party providers, such as identity verification solutions provider Okta."", ""The primary reason to be optimistic about Okta's future is that its Cloud Identity platform is cloud-native and reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In other words, it's overseeing countless events each day and learning how to spot and respond to potential threats. We've seen a number of endpoint cybersecurity providers lean on AI and ML solutions to strengthen their platforms."", ""Okta is also still very early in its expansion. During the company's Investor Day in November 2022, management spoke of an $80 billion addressable market in identity verification. Two years after this meeting, Okta is on track to generate about $2.5 billion in annual sales. It has ample opportunity to expand its market share in the coming years."", ""As I've previously pointed out, Okta's 2022 acquisition of Auth0 will likely prove critical to its long-term success. Auth0 gives the company beefed-up representation in the $30 billion addressable market for Customer Identity, and is playing a key role in pushing Okta's influence beyond the borders of the U.S."", ""Wall Street's consensus calls for Okta's earnings per share (EPS) to more than triple to $5.20 over the next four years."", 'A third no-brainer stock to buy with $500 right now is none other than pharmaceutical titan Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).', ""Over the last two years, one of Wall Street's largest drug developers became a victim of its own success. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Pfizer was one of a handful of companies to successfully develop a vaccine (now known as Comirnaty). It also developed an oral treatment (known as Paxlovid) to lessen the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in patients that tested positive. Collectively, Comirnaty and Paxlovid generated more than $56 billion in sales in 2022. This year, they're expected to combine for just $8 billion in revenue."", ""Though this rapid ascent and decline in Pfizer's sales clearly has Wall Street and investors off-kilter, it's important to look at just how far Pfizer has progressed from where things stood just a few years earlier."", ""In 2020, the company reported nearly $42 billion in total sales. Meanwhile, the midpoint of its sales guidance in 2024 is $60 billion. That's an estimated sales increase of 43% in four years, which is pretty impressive for a large-scale pharma company."", ""More importantly, Pfizer's novel drugs beyond its COVID-19 therapies have continued to grow at a steady pace. Excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, Pfizer's sales jumped by 11% on a constant-currency basis in the first quarter. The core driver was its oncology segment, which delivered 19% operational sales growth. The superstar here was advanced prostate cancer drug Xtandi, which grew sales by 23% from the prior-year period, and is currently pacing an annual run-rate of almost $1.7 billion in revenue."", ""Additionally, Pfizer closed its $43 billion acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen in December. Although this buyout is expected to weigh on EPS in 2024, this combination should yield meaningful cost savings in future years. Not to mention, it's also going to rapidly expand Pfizer's oncology pipeline."", ""With Pfizer's supercharged yield of 6% not in any danger, and its shares valued at just 10 times forward-year earnings, the stock looks like a plain-as-day bargain."", 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

It is inspired by the L.A. estate’s lush gardens.', 'Founder of Flamingo Estate Richard Christiansen is a former ad executive who first purchased the seven-acre garden estate in the hills overlooking Los Angeles surrounding a dilapidated 1940s home to renovate as his personal residence, an escape from the frenetic pace of his life in New York. The labor of love grew into a brand concept offering what he describes as products which bring together “the very best of Mother Nature.” What started with a line of natural handmade soaps inspired by the garden led to creams, candles and more. \xa0During COVID-19, as small local farmers suffered, he used the estate as a launchpad for curated farm boxes that became celebrity favorites. The estate, with its incredible variety of flora, was also the perfect place to cultivate honey, so Christiansen added bee-keeping to the portfolio as well.', 'The partnership with JW Marriott was seamless, said Christiansen.\xa0“We both believe in real hospitality, and it’s at the heart of what we do. The rare art of making someone feel loved and cared for is communicated through all these senses, but especially taste, touch and smell.”', 'Rohr said the collaboration with Flamingo Estate might be a surprise for guests.\xa0“For brands to stay relevant, but also to push ourselves into new spaces with the unexpected, is refreshing and sparks curiosity from guests and customers.”', 'The other sensory elements of the partnership include Flamingo Estate curated exclusive playlists for JW Marriott, created to correspond with the distinct energy of the different times of the day, respectively titled: Aurora, Sun, Twilight and Moon. \xa0The soundtrack will be in public spaces at JW Marriott locations across the globe.', 'Sweetening the guest journey, the third element in the collaboration is a signature Flamingo Estate co-branded California wildflower honey which incorporates holy basil and bergamot meant to promote well-being and resilience to stress. The honey will be featured in cocktails and savory dishes by chefs at select properties around the world.', 'The JW Marriott x Flamingo Estate scent will be available for sale as a hand-poured candle for $65, diffusers, sleep sprays along with the signature honey and other Flamingo Estate products at pop-up shops in JW Marriott properties around the world. The first month-long retail experience launches this week at JW Marriott Essex House in New York. Other locations include JW Marriott Dallas Arts District, JW Marriott Hotel Mexico City Polanco, JW Marriott Hotel Madrid, and JW Marriott Bengaluru Prestige Golfshire Resort & Spa in India.', 'Rohr said this is the first retail partnership of its kind with a brand for JW Marriott. “Luxury is really about the personalization of experiences we can provide. When guests stay with us and discover new products, create warm memories associated with the scents or tastes they experience at the hotel, that in turn makes them want to take a bit of that home with them, creating a deeper relationship and a sense of history with our brand.”']"

Each has a strong incentive to keep hiking their payouts through thick and thin to preserve their historical track record.', 'In fact, many Dividend Aristocrats are mature businesses with solid foundations. Some may be going through temporary periods of weakness. However, that presents an opportunity to scoop them up at attractive valuations since they’re unlikely to remain depressed for long.

ATO delivers steady and consistent returns for shareholders. While Atmos Energy’s top-line figures have been flat, the upside potential\xa0going forward\xa0hinges more on natural gas price dynamics.', 'Importantly, ATO represents a solid bet for both the short and long term.\xa0Natural gas prices\xa0are likely to\xa0readjust higher in the long run, and we’ve already seen a slight rebound in May. With Russia still supplying billions of cubic meters of gas to Europe, pressure will mount on the U.S. and Qatar, especially if we witness a cold winter.\xa0Nevertheless,\xa0natural gas prices don’t impact this company as much as one might think.\xa0Atmos Energy makes its money through the volume of natural gas distributed.\xa0This\xa0is why, despite lower revenue, net income grew 14.5% in the recent quarter.', 'Also, the company invested $770 million in capital expenditures, earning a robust 9.8% return. And, it benefited from $129 million in regulatory gains, with 82% of investments focused on safety and reliability. Atmos Energy appears well-positioned for continued regulatory approvals and earnings growth.

As I mentioned in a February 2022 article, “IBM will likely grow much faster in the future as it is making a turnaround by shifting its focus to cloud computing, AI, and blockchain, which will position it as a dynamic tech company.” That is precisely what has transpired, with the stock up 36% over the past year.', 'Hence, this\xa0performance\xa0is likely to\xa0continue. IBM has solid recurring revenue and a cash cow segment as a foundation from which it can build into some of the hottest sectors right now.\xa0Further, quantum computing will drive as much hype as artificial intelligence (AI)is doing in the coming decades. And IBM is ahead of its peers by miles in this field.', 'Also, its $6.4 billion acquisition of HashiCorp will give it a strong foothold in the cloud sector.

Some newer crypto tokens with artificial intelligence (AI) connections are still buoyant, and some of them are up more than 132% for the year.', ""A big reason for that has been the enormous enthusiasm around the artificial intelligence investment thesis. In the same way that equity investors have embraced Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), crypto investors are now embracing new crypto tokens they think could benefit the most from AI. With that in mind, here's a closer look at three of the most popular AI crypto tokens that have been seeing the biggest boosts lately."", 'Arguably, the most popular AI crypto token is Render (CRYPTO: RNDR) -- it\'s up 132% for the year. With a total market cap of $4.5 billion, Render now ranks as a top 25 cryptocurrency. Given its recent ascent, some investors now refer to Render as ""the Nvidia of crypto."" As you might have guessed from the name, Render offers GPU-based rendering solutions for studios, artists, and creators.', 'But that\'s not why crypto investors are so excited about Render. The thinking now is that the same decentralized GPU computing power used for rendering can also be used for AI. If you want to train a large language model (LLM), for example, you will need a lot of ""GPU compute,"" which is the raw computing power required for modern AI solutions.', ""So it's easy to see why Render's performance is starting to look a lot like Nvidia's (which has become nearly synonymous with all things AI). Nvidia is the ultimate source of all that GPU-based computing power, whether it's used for rendering or AI."", 'Fetch.ai (CRYPTO: FET) is up a staggering 208% for the year and now ranks as a top 50 crypto by market cap. Fetch.ai is building what it refers to as an ""open, permissionless, decentralized machine learning network with a crypto economy."" That\'s a mouthful, but it just means that Fetch.ai is a new platform for AI products and services. That includes large data sets for training LLMs and sophisticated AI bots known as agents.', 'The way that you pay for these AI products and services is with the Fetch.ai token. You can think of Fetch.ai as a digital currency for the emerging AI economy. Thus, the greater the demand for all things AI, the greater the demand for the Fetch.ai token.', ""While there is obviously some demand for AI on a consumer level (who hasn't played around with AI chatbots?), the real demand will come from companies looking to undergo AI transformations. That's where Nvidia comes into the picture because these companies are often using Nvidia's products for new AI-related projects."", 'According to Fetch.ai, the highest growth opportunities are in sectors such as logistics, transportation, and smart energy grids. As proof of its growing industry focus, Fetch.ai recently partnered with German companies Bosch and Deutsche Telekom on an AI platform.', 'Since 2017, Bosch has partnered with Nvidia on AI-powered self-driving cars, so that could be just one example of an area where Fetch.ai gets a huge boost. In the past, Deutsche Telekom has partnered with Nvidia on ""smart city"" concepts, so that might be another area.', ""Finally, there's SingularityNET (CRYPTO: AGIX), which is up an eye-popping 193% for the year. It now ranks as a top 75 cryptocurrency, with a $1.2 billion market cap. However, since it's not available for trading on popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), it may not be suitable for all crypto investors."", 'In terms of overall AI strategy, SingularityNET is hitting it out of the park. It is pushing forward the idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is leaps and bounds ahead of the current version of AI, known as generative AI (best known as the variety that includes ChatGPT).', 'In fact, according to futurists like Ray Kurzweil (now at Google), AGI implies a future in which a single computer will be smarter than all humans combined. It will have access to all human knowledge ever created and, as a result, will be able to create truly innovative solutions. To power that level of AI, it will probably require a lot of Nvidia GPUs.', ""As long as Nvidia's stock performance continues to impress, it's safe to say that investors will be on the lookout for crypto tokens most likely to benefit from the enthusiasm around AI. For investors who think that Nvidia is the one AI stock they need to own, then it also makes sense to focus on AI crypto tokens with indirect or direct ties to Nvidia."", 'However, just keep in mind that AI is still a relatively new industry, and trends can come and go. Plenty of companies claim to be ""the next Nvidia,"" so it\'s likely the AI investment thesis will change and evolve over time. For now, though, the three crypto tokens highlighted above appear to be doing the best job of benefiting from the new enthusiasm around AI.', 'Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

While the stock gave back a chunk of those gains in the subsequent weeks, Arm has remained one of a handful of stocks that are most closely associated with AI.', ""The company's fiscal Q4 earnings report last Wednesday easily beat expectations as well, but the stock fell 2.3% on the news. Investors seemed to think its full-year guidance should have been stronger."", 'However, pullbacks can be buying opportunities, especially for otherwise strong businesses. Arm stock is still expensive, but the valuation looks more reasonable now -- the price has come down since the February spike and after the company posted strong growth in Q4.', 'The company is generating wide profit margins, and based on its fiscal 2025 guidance, the stock now trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 27 and a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 66.', ""Is Arm stock a buy at those valuations? Here's what you should know before you make your decision."", ""Arm has a unique business model in the semiconductor industry. Unlike its peers, the company doesn't sell its products directly to its end users. Instead, it licenses its architecture and designs to partners like Nvidia and Apple, which use those chips in their products, and then generates royalty revenue when the products containing those chips are sold."", 'Typically, the company experiences a one to two-year lag between new licenses and the royalties that stem from that license.', ""Currently, the company is seeing a boom in license revenue related to AI demand as license revenue surged 60% to $414 million. However, those licenses won't flow through into royalty revenue for at least a year or two, which means that Arm's royalty revenue is likely to spike in fiscal 2026 and beyond."", 'In an interview with The Motley Fool, Arm CFO Jason Child said he envisioned the percentage of revenue coming from royalties to evolve from around 60% to more like 75% in a couple of years as the current license sales convert into products.', ""Royalty revenue also tends to be higher margin than license revenue, as royalty revenue typically comes from work that the company has already accounted for in previous years' expenses. So Arm's margins should expand as more of its revenue comes from royalties."", 'Investors often like to focus on guidance rather than the results of the quarter just reported. On some level, that makes sense. Guidance is based on future results, and stocks are valued based on their future earnings. However, overemphasizing guidance can be a mistake as guidance is just a forecast and is often incorrect.', ""Tech companies in general skew toward giving conservative guidance as they tend to trade at high valuations and don't want to miss their forecasts, and Arm seems to be establishing a similar pattern. The company has beaten guidance in all three of its earnings reports since going public, and while that pattern isn't guaranteed to continue, it does seem likely to persist, though management acknowledged that license revenue could be lumpy from quarter to quarter."", 'Child said on the earnings call that the company expected to generate revenue growth of at least 20% for the next three years.', ""Based on Q4 results and the momentum in AI, it wouldn't be surprising to see the company exceed that guidance. That means investors shouldn't interpret the full-year guidance as cause for concern."", ""Arm distinguishes itself with its power-efficient central processing unit (CPU) architecture, and its chip designs are preferable in devices like smartphones and in AI data centers where conserving power is at a premium. Alternative CPUs like the X86 from Intel or AMD can't compete with that."", ""That gives Arm a valuable competitive advantage and makes it a preferred partner for the likes of Nvidia and cloud-infrastructure companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. Management noted that the new Armv9 technology drove market-share gains in cloud servers, showing it's gaining traction in the category involved in AI applications."", 'Child also told The Motley Fool that demand for Arm\'s chips is accelerating because ""software needs are outpacing the hardware capabilities"" and power efficiency is a must for its customers. The demands of AI technology, then, are strengthening Arm\'s competitive advantages, and if AI demand grows, Arm will be a major beneficiary. Not only will its top-line growth remain strong, but its margins should expand as it collects increased royalty revenue.', ""There's still a lot of uncertainty in the AI boom, and that's reflected in Arm's relatively modest guidance. However, Arm's technology will play a central role in the development of AI. The only question is how fast AI adoption grows and how far it goes."", ""From the recent results, it's clear that momentum is building for Arm in AI, and investors should expect that trend to continue."", 'Arm stock is expensive, but it deserves a premium based on the accelerating growth and the opportunity in AI. Right now looks like an excellent time to scoop up shares of this AI stock as the price has moderated, and management shared plenty of reasons to be bullish in the latest update.', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

And that's helped the company reach $2.26 trillion in market value. The reason behind all of the excitement? Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven their ability to power the most crucial of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks -- such as the training of large language models (LLMs) -- and the company now holds about 80% of the AI chip market."", ""This chip giant still has plenty of great days ahead, but two other AI stocks could join it in the $2 trillion club and even go on to surpass Nvidia's market value. These players have solid moats protecting their main businesses and have delivered strong earnings over time. Now their focus on AI could launch a whole new era of growth."", 'While AI offers these players a boost in the coming years, increasing competition in the AI chip market may make it more difficult for Nvidia to grow as quickly as in recent times. Analysts expect annual growth of about 35% from Nvidia over the coming five years -- down from annual growth of more than 50% over the past five years.', 'My prediction is the following two AI growth stocks may be worth more than the chip giant in five years...', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a leader in the two high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, with a solid moat thanks to its brand strength. And these businesses have helped the company generate billions of dollars in earnings annually.', 'Though Amazon reported an annual loss in 2022 -- the first in nearly a decade as it struggled with rising inflation -- it quickly revamped its cost structure and delivered earnings growth a year later. Its efforts made Amazon more efficient and set the company on the right track for more growth down the road too.', ""Amazon also should benefit from its investments in AI, particularly through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. AWS is the world's leading cloud-computing provider, putting it in the position to win as more and more companies launch AI projects. Everyone's talking about AI these days, but it's important to remember we're at the beginning of this story, so much of the growth is yet to come."", 'AWS has prepared by offering customers all of the tools they need for their projects, from a wide range of chips for every budget to a fully managed service offering access to top LLMs.', '""We\'re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,"" CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his recent letter to shareholders. AWS, historically Amazon\'s biggest profit driver, recently reached a $100 billion annual revenue-run rate and reported double-digit growth in sales and operating income in the recent quarter.', ""Today, Amazon's market value totals $1.94 trillion, but it could easily increase 16% to reach Nvidia's market capitalization -- and even surpass it -- as demand for AI projects gain momentum."", ""You may use Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) every day without even thinking about it. Meta is the owner of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. More than 3.2 billion people use at least one of these apps daily. One reason Meta's moat is so strong is users know that if they leave Meta's social media for a rival platform, their contacts may not follow."", 'Advertisers understand this, so they flock to Meta with their marketing dollars, and this has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue annually for the technology company.', 'In recent times, Meta has put the focus on AI and has even said that its biggest investment area this year is in this high-growth technology. The company aims to launch AI across its apps, for example, by making an AI assistant available for every sort of use, from leisure to professional. Meta recently got the ball rolling by launching Meta AI, a conversational assistant in several English-speaking markets.', ""This should translate into revenue growth as users spend more time on Meta's apps, prompting advertisers to keep coming back and even increase their spending."", ""Meta hasn't yet monetized its investment in AI, but the positive point here, as I mentioned above regarding Amazon, is that AI growth truly is in the early stages. That means AI could offer Meta a significant growth driver down the road."", ""Meta today is worth $1.18 trillion, so it would have to gain about 90% to reach Nvidia's market value. That might seem like a lot, but Meta may have what it takes to make the leap. After all, over the past five years, the company's revenue and market value climbed 90% and 100%, respectively. So as the AI investment starts to bear fruit and boost earnings, Meta could replicate that performance -- and surpass Nvidia in the years to come."", 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

However, that is far from a sure thing, and in my opinion, investors are paying a hefty price relative to the risk at hand.', ""Based on the company's $50.8 million in trailing 12-month revenue and its market cap of $1.8 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 35. By comparison, Nvidia trades at a P/S of 36, but it's growing its revenue even more quickly than SoundHound, and the company is highly profitable.

Besides, Nvidia's stake is only worth $9 million -- if it went to zero, the $2.2 trillion chip giant wouldn't even flinch."", 'Therefore, buying the stock should be reserved for investors with a very high risk tolerance.

These solutions are specifically designed to assist enterprises in mitigating risk and safeguarding their data across hybrid, multi-cloud environments and workloads.Leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation techniques, these solutions bring together human expertise and advanced technologies for faster response, efficiency and transparency through a holistic approach to secure hybrid cloud environments. Moreover, a higher demand for data computing at the edge, triggered by the rapid deployment of 5G and the proliferation of IoT devices, has forced tech firms to ensure their resiliency, performance, security and compliance standards.In addition to organic growth, technology firms are gradually leaning toward the inorganic route to bolster their cybersecurity domain. The merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy heralds a new era of innovation in AI-driven cybersecurity solutions. As the companies join forces, their complementary strengths are poised to reshape the industry landscape, delivering enhanced value to customers and stakeholders alike.Let us delve a little deep for a brief analysis of three such notable transactions in 2024 to get an essence of the sector developments.Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO acquired Splunk Inc. in March in a transaction valued at $28 billion. Splunk's expertise in advanced AI-powered solutions stands to greatly enhance Cisco's AI-driven service offerings. By leveraging Splunk's capabilities, Cisco aims to accelerate the development of next-generation solutions, optimizing data value and reinforcing security analytics.This strategic alignment reflects industry trends, where the convergence of cybersecurity and AI is increasingly paramount. As organizations navigate complex digital ecosystems, the demand for AI-driven security solutions continues to surge. By integrating Splunk's cutting-edge technologies, Cisco strengthens its position as a formidable player in this evolving landscape, poised to deliver innovative solutions tailored to meet evolving customer needs.From Splunk's perspective, the merger represents a significant win-win scenario. It provides access to Cisco's robust resources and global reach, facilitating accelerated research and development initiatives. Moreover, the collaboration positions Splunk at the forefront of AI innovation, enabling the creation of synergistic solutions that address the evolving cybersecurity challenges faced by enterprises worldwide."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'In April, International Business Machines Corporation IBM inked an agreement to acquire HashiCorp Inc. HCP. Based in California, HashiCorp is a software company that enables organizations to efficiently automate multi-cloud and hybrid environments with its Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management solutions.With a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which, in turn, has led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and highly interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. IBM’s acquisition of HCP is a probable ploy to address these issues.Representing an enterprise value of $6.4 billion, the deal will significantly augment IBM’s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. Moreover, HashiCorp’s tool sets will likely complement IBM RedHat’s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management.

news for everyone.', 'The rally costing short sellers nearly $1.5 billion more volatility expected to come.', 'Well, stocks are moving to the upside here is new inflation data showing that prices are remaining stubbornly high producer prices coming in above estimates across the board.', 'The core number which excludes food and energy rising 510 of a percent month over month that is compared to the 0.2% rise that was expected in the prior month.', 'Lessening that impact of the surprise here.', 'So what could this mean for the Fed and for markets joining us now on this, we have John for new Investment Management chief Investment Officer and the head of Equity John.', 'Thanks so much for being here.', 'We are expecting to hear from Fed Chair Powell any second this morning.', ""I'm curious from your perspective."", 'What does he need to address from this PP I, if anything?', ""Well, from this print in particular, I don't think he really needs to address anything but what the markets clearly want to hear from him is that he's committed to a path where the next move in rates is down and I I don't think that we're going to hear him wavering from that narrative."", ""All I think that that's the primary area of focus right now is, you know, a focus on when the next cut is not."", 'If, if the market starts to debate the possibility of rate hikes, that becomes a much bigger challenge for the market to digest in my opinion.', ""Is that something that you think is on the table, John, I don't think it's on the table at this point."", 'I think the fed knows that underneath the covers of an economy that looks pretty strong on the surface, there are some unmistakable challenges from, from the current level of interest rates.', ""We've certainly seen, seen it in the turnover of exist homes."", ""For example, you're seeing it in some of the small business formation numbers, you're seeing it in small business confidence."", 'So I think underneath the surface, they know that the higher rates are really pinching some corners of the economy, but the agri economy is solid right now.', 'Well, I want to switch gears a little bit to talk about the earnings cycle.', ""Our colleague Josh Safe for has a story out on how earnings growth for the S and P would be over 8% versus the 5% move if it wasn't for Bristol Myers earnings."", ""How do you ride the momentum of this market as

there's a handful of stocks that because of this, the, the magnitude of their earnings, they can, they can distort the, the, the, the total picture."", 'But I think if you step back and look at earning this earnings season, it was a very strong earnings season across the board.', 'On average in the S and P 500 the average company beat earnings estimates by somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 to 9% which is about double the normal beat rate.', ""So this has been a strong earnings season and importantly, it's you know, well, there have been a handful of very large companies that have had a big impact on that."", 'The breadth of the earnings improvement has is continued to improve.', ""And I think that's leading to a bit of a broadening out of the market so that as the earnings season does start to wane here, I know that you said that that's responsible for a lot of the momentum."", 'What will be the next catalyst for the market is earnings does wrap up?', ""I think we're back to focus on the macro as, as you mentioned earlier, Madison today, the, the, the the detailed analysis of, of PP, we're going to get CP I tomorrow, there's going to be continued focus on the macro."", ""It's really remarkable to me that we're sitting here in mid May with a broad market up eight or 9% so far and we've gone from an expectation of of six rate cuts at the beginning of the year to now just one or two."", 'The resiliency of the market in the face of of much more modest rate cut expectations is very impressive to me.', ""I think the the focus is going to continue to be on all the inflation headlines to assure us that the next move is down when it's going to happen is a very difficult question to answer."", ""But as long as the market continues to feel the next move is down, I think you've got a good support for the for the broad market here, John, when you take a look at some of the moves that we are seeing, you got to talk about or you got to take a look at least the meme rally and what we are seeing in gamestop, but we are seeing in a MC."", ""I'm not gonna ask you to specifically comment about that rally that we're seeing in those specific memes, but I'm curious from a macro perspective."", 'Should we be paying attention to this at all?', 'And why and why not?', 'I Sean, I wish I had a better answer for you.', ""I don't know."", 'I you absolutely should be paying attention to it.', ""The question is, what's the message?"", 'What, why, why is this happening?', ""What's what's underlying this, this move in markets?"", 'If you step back when we had a meme stock rally, you know, back in 2020 2021 when it was all the rage when you really got behind it, there was a, there was an undercurrent of liquidity there that was an important call for what was going on.', 'If you really understood the implications of liquidity, both in terms of, of, you know, juice for the market, but also to, to the, the the opportunity for, to create inflation challenges, it would have been a real some really important issues to understand.', 'And underneath the surface of that mean stock rally, is there something like that happening today?', ""It's, it's too early to tell we're 24 hours into this mean stock rally."", ""But as a fundamental long term oriented investor, I'm certainly cognizant of any short term volatility and trying to understand if there's a turning point in the market that I need to to to have a better grip on."", ""And John, that's what I was curious about just this exuberance and maybe the signals that is in the market clearly."", 'What ultimately this could essentially mean even with Powell, he has commented on the meme rally in the past going back a couple of years, but even how the fed could potentially be looking at some of this excitement, then what that ultimately means here for the broader markets and for strategists like you.', 'Yeah, I would, I would hope the fed like myself is paying attention to everything, but you also need to have it in, in, you know, keep things in context, I mean, the US economy is what 22 trillion or, or something of that magnitude.', 'So uh uh you, you mentioned off the top the the losses that shorts had in, in games, stop and, and so forth over the last 24 hours.', 'Those are a small drop in the bucket in this matter, ocean, ocean of our economy.', 'But again, the FED is not doing their job.', ""If not, they're not paying attention to every marginal incremental data point trying to understand it when you look across other parts of the economy."", ""There's plenty of evidence that there's some, some, some challenges underneath the surface in the economy that the FED needs to be mindful of and be cognizant of."", 'When they think about the rate policy, when you look at some of the consumer data points in, in, you know, Q one earnings, you saw some evidence that the, the pinch from inflation is, is starting to be felt by consumers.', ""You're seeing on the margin of some slowdown in, in, in certain cohorts of consumer behavior."", 'And I suspect the fed is much more worried about that than they are uh one or two stocks adding a few billion in market cap.', 'All right, John Porter, always great to get your insight here.', 'Thanks so much for hopping on and joining us here this morning, Newton Investment Management, Chief Investment Officer and head of equity.', 'Turning now to President Biden announcing new tariffs on $18 billion worth of Chinese goods, imports on batteries, semiconductors and other materials made in China will see levies double or triple to as high as 100%.', 'In the case of S President Biden also keeping in place $300 billion worth of levies from former President Trump that he to put on imports from China in 2018 and 2019.', ""So is Biden's decision motivated as much by the upcoming election as it is by us China relations?"", 'Joining us.', ""Now we want to bring in our very own, Rick Newman and you're the perfect person to ask, what do you think two things are going on here?"", ""So the Biden tariffs, first of all, they're pretty small, they're pretty small relative to what Trump did and analysts I've been following saying they might be so small that China does not even retaliate against these tariffs which will be good."", ""Um So, first of all, they do fit with what Biden has been doing his whole term, which is incentivizing the development of certain industries here in the United States or the redevelopment if you will reshoring and we know what those are, I mean it's semiconductors that that was the chips act that he signed in 2022 electric vehicle technology, green energy, the green energy transition and all the the supply chains that go in that that was part of the Inflation Production Act in 2022."", ""So what Biden is doing now is he's just making it more expensive to import those types of things from China."", 'And pretty minor, I mean electric vehicles, for example, there are practically no Chinese electric vehicles on sale in the United States at all these days.', 'So the 100% tariff there is meant to keep them out.', ""That's the first thing."", ""Number two definitely targeted at swing state politics because that's, you know, these are the key states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, think about those states, there's a lot of manufacturing there, auto industry and other types of manufacturing."", ""Biden wants to be able to campaign in those states and say I'm looking out for the workers here."", ""So that's another thing this is about and this is kind of in line with some of the work that we saw from former President Trump to a degree."", ""I'm curious which strategy seems to be more effective at winning voters from those candidates."", 'Who knows?', ""I mean, I mean, we'll find out, I guess anyone knows that."", 'I mean, you know, for as much as we, you know, we geek out on these policies in the news industry.', ""I mean, there's been some really interesting research showing that people don't have any idea what Biden has actually done in office."", 'They are just tuned out.', ""Um, I mean, people are busy, you know, some people are working two jobs, they're trying to figure out how to, you know, manage the kids and you guys know, know the drill, right?"", ""I mean, so people aren't tuned to, uh, you know, Biden's youtube channel to figure out what he's doing about Chinese tariffs."", 'So, you know, the real question is, will this break through enough?', ""And uh we're going to talk, we've talked about this already."", ""We'll talk about a lot more in the next six months."", 'But, you know, this election is going to come down to a really small group of swing voters in probably five or six swing states.', 'So, uh whatever, either one of these candidates can do to win an extra.', ""I mean, we're talking about, you know, 5000 voters potentially if you can just get a few people from this union or that union shop to show up, maybe get their spouses, family members to show up and vote for you."", 'That sort of stuff could swing the election.', ""So that's a big factor in what's going on here."", 'All right, Rick, thanks so much for bringing all of that down.', ""You are going to be joining me now and just about actually two hours from now, we've got live coverage of President Biden's speech that's coming up at 1210 pm Eastern time this afternoon."", ""You won't want to miss that."", ""All right, let's talk about another big story that we are watching today and that is the return of the meme rally, Gamestop A MC and Blackberry extending the gains that we saw yesterday and it's extending into today."", 'The surge initially sparked when a big name behind the 2021 meme stock rally, Keith Gil known online as roaring Kitty.', 'He returned to social media posted that meme that we showed you guys yesterday.', 'But what could the impact have on the broader markets?', 'We put that question to Megan Horn in last hour.', ""She's Vernon's Capital Advisors, Chief Investment Officer, and here's what she had to say about that."", ""Now, we're seeing this specula speculation trades, the fear of missing out."", 'This is all a bigger risk to the market.', 'This is why we think we can still see at least a 10% correction.', ""So Marie, she's saying that we could see at least a 10% correction."", ""She's talking about what this means in the context of the macro investor, the macro environment, how closely you should or maybe are paying attention to this."", ""But the moves though and what this signifies, you go back to the euphoria that's playing out in the market, you go back to maybe how closely fed Chair Powell is looking at this recent moves and what exactly this could signal."", ""We're still very, very far from those 2021 levels."", 'But we are starting to talk about what we did, what we were discussing what, three years ago, longer than that just three years ago.', ""Well, a lot has happened to your point but, and it was a great question that you asked our guest earlier about what it means for the Fed and what it tells us about the loosening of financial conditions because the idea should be that consumers and retail investors are not able to invest the way they were a few years ago because we've had this record breaking interest rate hike."", 'You should have as much liquidity on hand to be able to throw at some of the stocks that have no fundamentals back of their value at the current moment.', ""So it's interesting to look at it from a perspective of whether or not the fed is going to be bringing up the meme stock return of the stock rally here in the upcoming page book there, particularly given just the run up that we have seen."", 'We also have this A MC fundraising deal of the at the market offering, letting them create new shares opportunistically to finance their debt.', 'That is also leading to some of the gains were seen in A MC and really across the board for a lot of the various stock was also interesting.', 'Um Josh Shaver Marcus reporter sent this over has some stats from band to research.', ""And it's interesting here because we a lot of times when we talk about the meme R, it's associated to what happened in 2021 and just to put a little bit more context on what we are seeing right now."", 'GME salt net inflows of just around 15.8 million A MC attracted 37.5 million on Monday.', ""Now, for reference, that's a far cry from what we saw play out in 2021 those two socks in January 27 2021."", 'So 87.5 million of inflows and 100 and 70 million of inflows for A MC respectively.', 'So not exactly at the levels that we were looking at back in 2021.', ""And I think also the question out there for so many people is what this participation looks like from a retail trader perspective versus institutional involvement, at least coming out of uh the guys over at Vander research are saying that this doesn't mean that retail didn't have an impact this time because roughly GME registered roughly 7% here."", 'Sorry, let me go back to the past five trading sessions.', 'The average retail share of turno turnover for GME for gamestop registered roughly 7%.', 'It was about 10% for A MC.', ""So it doesn't mean that it didn't have as much of an impact or as much of influence."", 'But it does imply that we are seeing institutional investor participation here when you take into account, the larger numbers that also puts in perspective, some of the activity that we are seeing today and what we saw play out yesterday and likely for the remainder of the week as well are coming up a deep dive into Home Depot.', 'Latest results that we will break that down this week with the former Ceo Bob Nelli on the other side of the break.', ""Don't go anywhere, do check of the markets here sponsored by tasty trade looking, not a ton of action here actually coming off of the market highs when you look at the S and P and the NASDAQ, the S and P basically unchanged."", 'NASDAQ is up about 1/10 of a percent and the dow just holding on to gains.', 'Now, this might be coming from some commentary that we are getting in from Fed chair, Jay Powell specifically related to the producer price index from this morning.', ""He said it's pretty much mixed."", 'He said the headline numbers were higher but there were backwards revisions were of course disassembling it taking apart and markets and analysts are looking at it, but he would not call that print hot.', 'So that might be just enough to push this market to the upside this morning but still awaiting some more commentary from Powell and particularly when he does start to talk about rate hikes.', ""And it looks like right now he is saying that it's more likely that they would hold policies right where they are for a little longer."", 'All right, man, talk earnings because Home Depot on the move here this morning there result showing that shoppers are at least for now putting their HD TV dreams on hold.', 'Consumers are seeking out fewer do it yourself projects compared to what we saw during the pandemic.', 'And as a result of that, that pull back that we are seeing in consumer spending, same store sales, they declined 2.8% during the quarter for a deeper dive.', 'We wanna bring in Bob Nardelli, the former CEO of Home Depot.', 'Bob.', ""It's great to see you."", ""So I'd love to just get your reaction to these, these results that we got out from Home Depot this morning."", 'And this trend that we have seen on the weakening consumer.', 'What does that signal.', 'Yeah.', 'Well, first of all, thank you for having me.', ""II, I couldn't be prouder of what Ted Decker and the team is doing over at Home Depot."", 'I think they had a pretty solid quarter.', ""Again, given the challenges that we're facing in the economy."", 'I think that, uh, you know, again, his proposed acquisition of SRS for 18.9 is a knockout punch.', ""Uh, he'll add that to the home supply business."", ""He'll own the pro customers while still having over 2000 stores to serve the, the residential consumers."", ""So I, I think they're very well positioned, they're well run, they're organized and I think they got a terrific product offering across the board in all of the SKU that they have over there."", 'So I, I think what is happening is some of the discretionary projects that were done during COVID post 911 when the home became a sanctuary are now being deferred.', 'Why are they being deferred?', ""You know, we talk a lot about the consumer is strong and they're spending a lot of money or are they spending a lot of money but getting less volume?"", ""So that's why we see credit card debt accelerating here."", ""So I, I think they have to be much more discerning in what they're doing."", ""They're being very conservative about managing their bank accounts and their credit cards."", 'I, I wish, I wish we were doing that at the national debt level to be honest, with you.', 'So, so I think Home Depot will continue to be well positioned.', ""It's well run."", 'They got over 460,000 associates uh serving, you know, basically across North America and also uh also on a global basis, Bob, what do you mean by spending more or less volume?', 'Is that a nod to services spending going up?', 'Now?', ""Here's what's happening."", 'I mean, we keep talking about on the news, You keep hearing, well, the consumer is strong.', ""They're still spending, well, are they spending more because of volume that they're buying or are they really spending more due to inflation?"", ""I, I deal with businesses seven days a week and I would tell you that inflation, we'll see it tomorrow again, is alive and well, I think it's got a long tail."", ""I'm starting to see it more and more even the specialty materials."", ""You know, if you think about what we're hearing with Biden, putting tariffs on China on evs, that's not going to help the cost."", 'You know, most of the EV manufacturers, we heard from Ford losing $100,000 on every vehicle.', ""We hear Musk now recognizes he's got to put more chargers out there."", ""It's a charging anxiety."", 'Now, not the range anxiety the challenge will be, is this country really have the power to support an EV fleet when at the same time, we have a war on fossil fuels.', 'So the ambiguity and the missteps and the debacles of this administration astounds me.', ""You know, I think we're, we'll see significant cracks in the economy we have and whoever goes into that White House is going to be hit like a, like a bowling ball with some of these challenges given where, where we positioned our country and the economy and the cracks in the economy."", ""So Bob, before we get into the tariffs, I'm curious just to get your perspective a bit more on the consumer right now and specifically how you would advise the CEO of Home Depot to Decker, how he should be navigating this."", 'What is expected to be a complex couple of quarters here because we are starting to see signs of the consumer weakening.', ""I know you were saying that he's been doing a great job here, but just from your experience as the lead as the CEO of Home Depot, what is it?"", 'What do you think the next couple of months, what the next couple of quarters will likely look like for this name?', 'Yeah.', ""Well, there's no doubt, uh Ted and the team do a magnificent job of marketing merchandizing and product selection."", ""So what we'll see probably at Home Depot we're seeing at the grocery stores, people are trading down on brands, they're going more to opening price points, they're buying less of the high end material."", 'You know, again, uh with the home becoming a sanctuary, I think people will continue to want all of the comforts outdoor that they have indoor, relative to kitchens, relative to furniture.', ""You know, when's the last time you saw an aluminum web folding chair in, uh, in the Home Depot store."", ""So I, I think there'll be, there'll be a, a selection process that goes on and, and they are smart enough to know how to market that, how to position that, how to provide the continuing services."", 'You know, you may not improve things, but you still have to repair things that are broken.', ""So they'll focus on how do they maintain that customer service service opportunities to provide the ultimate service to the consumers that they have out there and, and they'll do a great job."", ""They'll look at, you know, if you get another dollar a cart, it's billions of dollars to Home Depot."", ""So they'll figure out how to sell the entire project."", ""If you're coming in to paint something, you get your brushes, your drop cloths, your everything related to the project to save you from making another trip to pay $4 and above for a gallon of gas."", ""So, they've been through this before, you know, we live through it in, in, in, in the 2000 period and uh they'll come out the other side, extremely strong, very, very strong."", ""So I'm gonna ask you to put on another executive hat here, Bob."", ""I'm curious if you were to become the VP of asset protection, what would be the single biggest thing that you would do to prevent theft in stores."", 'Well, you know, you raise an excellent point.', 'Uh, you know, we had shrink when I was there in 2000 but it was legitimate shrink.', 'It was shrink.', 'That happened as a result of freight handling.', 'Uh, light bulbs got broken, things got damaged and we spent an inordinate amount of money to put surveillance cameras.', ""We had a, a, uh observation room and back then we could legally stop someone that was stealing, we could stop someone that, you know, basically it's theft, it's not, it, it's, it's a misnomer to call theft shrink."", 'Right.', 'We do it to be polite, but we, we were able to control that.', 'Ted and his team now are putting security people.', ""They're adding dogs, they're adding outdoor parking lot surveillance, all of that adds to cost."", 'And on top of that theft continues to add an inordinate amount of cost to operating that business.', ""So look, Ted's doing everything he can within the limits of, of the regulations that are out there today until we get serious about it."", ""I think they're going to continue to have to live with it, unfortunately."", ""All right, Bob Bob, we have you, let's talk about the tariffs that are, uh, that were announced here today and specifically what it means for the EV industry."", ""And I'm asking you this as the former CEO of Chrysler."", ""I'm curious just what you make of the current competition landscape right now between the US automakers exactly the threat if it's really a threat that we are seeing from Chinese ev makers."", ""And then also just the idea that has been floated by a couple of members of Congress, specifically as Senator Sherrod Brown, who's saying that he actually wants the Biden administration to ban a Chinese EVs outright."", 'Is that something that should be considered?', ""Well, I, I'm not, I'm not a big proponent of that."", ""I think I'm a big free market guy."", ""And if they look, they have a strategic advantage, they've got all the raw materials."", ""They've been at it for a long time."", ""They aren't burdened by all of this green movement."", ""They're not burdened by a number of these regulations, you know, government taxes, epa S et cetera when I was running, you know, Chrysler or GE we had to compete on a global basis."", 'So I never had an outsourcing strategy, but I did have a global competitiveness strategy.', ""So I had to compete with the likes of Seamen's A BB, just like Ford General Motors and a lot of the EV companies here are having to compete with China."", 'So, ok, you can stop the import of evs.', 'But how is that really going to grow?', 'You know, the, the hypocrisy here.', 'He wants to grow the, the installed base of evs.', ""So if everybody's losing money, I mean, look at these start ups, 5 $6 billion last year on ev start up because we're buying most of the raw material offshore."", 'And then we have this increased labor rate.', ""Look, I'm all for families making a fair living."", 'We see the UAW now going after a few more auto companies here and, and I understand the purpose of that, but that will come back to haunt us because the cost of the automobile will go up.', ""And here's what will happen in 2000 when we, when we had the uh an 89 with, with the Obama administration, we had the cafe standard."", 'What happened?', 'The average age of the internal combustion engine car went up significantly who benefited the auto stores?', 'Right?', ""So here we are again now trying to force EVs when we don't have enough electricity or chargers, we know that A I will dwarf the Bitcoin data centers and it's just going to suck electricity out of the grid and we don't see major investments going into grid because of this war on fossil fuel."", ""So I, I don't understand, I don't understand the logic, the simplicity of trying to make these ambiguous decisions in what we're trying to do to this economy."", 'Uh Bob in our final minute together more like 30 seconds.', 'Here, I am curious in terms of the impact on the market and businesses that make up the market, would legislation against companies like a she and or a team will be more effective at maintaining market momentum.', ""Than the legislation that we're hearing about now."", 'Well, she is doing a great job again.', 'They, they really have come up with a business model where they produce a run.', ""It's attractive."", ""It's, it's affordably priced."", 'They ship it in.', ""I'm very familiar, you know, they have, they have cargo planes going back and forth daily, they do the distribution."", ""So it's a pretty effective model given the economy and the situation where we are with inflation and still trying to provide consumer solution."", ""So II I think uh I think they've got a good business model now we can stop that."", ""I'm not sure the impact of what's going to happen."", 'Do we just get into a, a trade war?', ""I I it's like a price war once you start it, how the heck do you get out of it has been my experience."", 'All right, Bob Nardelli, we always appreciate you taking the time.', 'Great to get your insight here on a wide range of topics.', 'Bob Nardelli, former Home Depot CEO as well as the former CEO of Chrysler as well.', 'Thanks so much, Bob.', 'Thank you very much.', ""Let's take a look at Uber shares are off just over 1% here in early trading."",

complete this transaction."", 'Bernstein analysts say that it will face anti trust scrutiny because basically food panda and Uber eats split the delivery market in Taiwan.', 'The analysts expect a reduction in competitive intensity and also a consolidation of fixed costs.', ""Uber has said major urban areas in the northern part of Taiwan would see a wider selection if this deal goes through and

problem solving self driving and autonomy.', ""Look, it's a hard problem to solve and the stakes are pretty high from a both a technology but also a human sort of safety point of view."", 'So a lot going on in that space and now Google struggling with that.', 'What do you think this ultimately does obviously will delay the timeline of this just in terms of mainstream adoption and exactly what that looks like, but just in terms of how much more investment research is maybe necessary at this point and how much of a Capex problem this could potentially be here for some of these companies who are trying to be larger players within this space.', ""Yeah, if you're Tesla, you're looking at from Musk's point of view, we're gonna invest heavily in A I and, and a machine learning and go with that route, go with the vision learning a route and see how that goes."", 'Uh Other companies like Ford, for instance, they used to have a big uh Argo A I um A start up joint JV with VW.', 'They, they

don't have a big price attached to them."", ""So it's interesting to see them coming up so high here."", 'But yet another company announcing a bundle when we know that this is just a return to the old when it comes to bundling a bunch of different networks together for a lump sum.', 'Yeah.', 'And I think it also highlights the issue that this industry has been facing here that we heard from a number of analysts here that closely followed the sector and even former executives here that have obviously have a lot of experience within this space.', ""We've been waiting for consolidation within this."", 'A lot of that talk has then turned to bundling and exactly what these companies can do in order to entice users to come to their platforms because as it looks like right now and you can see from these numbers, I think excluding Netflix, many of these companies have a saturation problem.', 'At least here in the US.', ""People are still many people who haven't cut the cord, they're still spending on cable, those that have cut the cord, they are starting to subscribe to more and more of these platforms."", ""And it simply, there's, they might even be spending more than they were when they had cable subscription."", ""So we're seeing a bit of a pullback here from the consumer."", 'Obviously, this also coming at a time of persistent high inflation, consumers are forced to make some uh cuts here in terms of their discretionary spending streaming offering could be one of those cuts that are on the table for many of consumers right now.', 'So the larger uh traditional players are trying to do everything they can in order to gain a bit more exposure, a bit more market share within the streaming space.', ""They're trying to compete with Netflix and they're also trying to do this in the balancing act while not spending too much money and turn profitable here for their streaming businesses."", ""So it's a tough line to walk."", ""And I think that is clear from the recent results that we've gone out from Warner Brothers discovery what we're hearing from Disney, even what we're hearing from Comcast."", ""So they're doing all they can to pull in more subscribers whether or not the bundling is the answer or we're going to essentially see more consolidation within the space."", 'We can take a look at the new surrounding Paramount.', ""I think that's a big question for investors right now too."", 'So good news for some of these stocks, we got Netflix up on the day as well as uh NBC and C.

interesting is it's not just on the equity side today."", ""We're seeing a lot more options trading also."", 'So I would expect the options by them to continue to explode.', 'And for a couple of

feel like it is?', ""I think uh yesterday, you know, everyone, everyone was a bit skeptical if this was gonna last or not today, it's clearly lasting."", ""And I mean, look, it's uh it's interesting

trying to say maybe we should just stay away to both directions JJ.', ""How closely should the average investor be watching the moves that we're seeing in meme socks?"", ""Well, I, I think, you know, it's interesting but is it part of most people's portfolio?"", 'Probably not.', 'So I think you have to be a little bit careful there.', 'You know, Adam talked about the free-market moves there.', 'One thing to keep in mind if you are trading in there.', 'Uh whether you trade options or not using the options market to show you what the market is expecting is really wise in my opinion.', 'And right now what the market is telling us through implied volatility as that in gamestop.', ""So you have a stock that's basically trading right around $49."", 'Right now.', 'The expected move from now until Friday is $24.', 'So half the stock price to move up or down between now and Friday.', 'And I think when people start doing any type of trading, the first thing you should say is not how much I can make, but how much can I lose?', ""Do you ha you know, we all have the stomach if you buy something and it goes up $24 you're happy as can be."", ""But do you have the stomach if it's gonna go down $24 and you can see how fast these moves are happening."", ""So, the biggest thing I would say is if you go in and play this stock and it's not one that you normally do, please do it in a very small manner because the movements are happening so very quickly overall."", 'So, uh the other thing, even with a MC, you know, trading about $9.5 right now, that move from now until Friday, you have a uh implied move of $4.5.', 'Again, these stocks, almost 50% of their price.', ""They're expected to move between now and Friday."", 'That alone should be a letter of caution for anybody interested in that.', ""Adam really quickly here, we're still seeing that a lot of the action in the trade for these names is coming from retail investors for this rally to continue throughout the course of the week."", ""Let's say even the month does it have to hit more of the institutional investor side?"", 'I mean, I think right now and those are some great statistics that, that JJ just outlined.', 'I mean, the the implied volatility on these stocks in the hundreds of percent that the and and the options are trading.', ""That's just a testament to the risk appetite that's present in the market right now."", 'I think from both institutional and retail investors.', ""Um and I think that's something we're seeing throughout the entire market from, from tech stocks to the S and P to meme stocks, there's just risk appetite everywhere."", ""So um it's hard to say really how long this can last with these stocks."", ""But I do think that the impact of meme stocks isn't necessarily one that's going to drive the entire market."", ""I think institutional capital, it's still focusing on the bigger names."", 'And I think in the background, you have this kind of meme stock situation

As a part of this program, the U.S. government has awarded nearly $30 billion in grants and $25 billion in loans to seven companies. Thanks to these massive investments, semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the U.S. is set to triple by 2032, growing an estimated 203% in less than a decade, according to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association and Boston Consulting Group.', ""Let's take a closer look at two semiconductor companies that are beneficiaries of the CHIPS Act.\xa0Both have already received assistance from the U.S. government, are growing at a terrific rate, and could deliver huge upside by 2032 that could match the jump in U.S. semiconductor spending."", 'On April 25, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) reached preliminary terms with the U.S. government for a proposed funding of $6.1 billion under the CHIPS Act, along with proposed loans of up to $7.5 billion. The memory specialist says that this grant will support its capex plans worth $50 billion to build advanced chips in the U.S. through 2030.', ""This improved production capacity will give Micron's growth a big boost in the long run, allowing it to win a bigger share of the market it operates in. Micron was the third-largest supplier of dynamic random access memory chips (DRAM) last year, with a share of 23%."", 'It is worth noting that Micron is witnessing robust demand for its DRAM chips thanks to AI. For instance, on the March earnings conference call, management remarked that Micron has sold out its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) capacity for 2024. Micron also added that ""the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated.""', ""That's not surprising -- the demand for HBM is expected to triple this year because of its deployment in AI chips from the likes of Nvidia and others. HBM demand is expected to double once again next year and could clock annual growth of 68% through 2030. Meanwhile, the overall memory market is expected to generate $338 billion in annual revenue in 2032, compared to $134 billion in 2023, according to Credence Research."", ""So, Micron's higher production capacity, thanks to the favorable conditions in the U.S. semiconductor industry, should pave the way for long-term growth. The good part is that Micron is already growing quickly thanks to outstanding end-market demand. As the following chart indicates, its earnings are expected to take off following a loss of $4.45 per share in the previous fiscal year."", ""Assuming Micron does hit $10.16 per share in earnings in a couple of fiscal years and trades at 30 times earnings, in line with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), its share price could increase to $305 per share. That would be 2.5 times its current stock price. Moreover, the secular growth opportunity in the memory market and the company's focus on enhancing its capacity could help it deliver more upside in the future, and the stock may even triple in the long run."", 'With Micron currently trading at 17 times forward earnings, investors are getting a good deal on this semiconductor stock right now, and they should consider taking advantage of its cheap valuation. It seems built for impressive long-term growth.', 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, is another beneficiary of the CHIPS Act. Last month, the U.S. Department of Commerce proposed $6.6 billion in direct funding and another $5 billion in proposed loans to the foundry giant to support its expansion in the U.S. The company has already completed its first fabrication facility in the U.S. and is currently constructing another one. And now, TSMC will add a third fabrication plant in Arizona.', 'This new plant will bring TSMC\'s total investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing in Arizona to $65 billion. TSMC says that it has decided to build a third plant to ""meet strong customer demand leveraging the most advanced semiconductor process technology in the United States."" TSMC management said on the April earnings conference call that it plans to spend 70% to 80% of its $28 billion to $32 billion capital budget for 2024 on advanced process technologies.', ""These advanced processes refer to chips manufactured on nodes that are 7 nanometers (nm) or smaller, and their demand has increased substantially over the past year thanks to AI. TSMC's customers, such as Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Apple,\xa0are using process nodes that are 5 nm or smaller in their AI chips and AI-focused products such as MacBooks."", ""Moreover, this strong customer base has made TSMC the world's leading foundry with a market share of 61%, according to Counterpoint Research. This puts the company way ahead of Samsung,\xa0 the second-largest foundry in the world with a share of 14%. This dominant market share means that TSMC is in a solid position to capitalize on the overall growth of the semiconductor market."", 'Precedence Research forecasts that the semiconductor market could be worth an estimated $1.9 trillion in 2032, compared to $664 billion last year. In simple words, the global semiconductor market could triple in less than a decade, and TSMC may witness solid growth in its business by expanding its manufacturing capacity and capturing a bigger share of the same.', ""Analysts expect TSMC's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 21% for the next five years. Assuming it can maintain even a 15% annual earnings growth for the next decade, its bottom line could jump to $25 per share. TSMC has a five-year average earnings multiple of 21, and a similar multiple after a decade (hypothetically -- all else equal) could send its stock price to $525 based on the earnings projected above."", 'That would be more than three times its current stock price, suggesting that investors looking to take advantage of the revolution in the U.S. semiconductor industry would do well to buy TSMC stock for the long run.', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

Ferris and the company she leads is looking to get to back to buying.', 'In February, FIS closed the sale of a majority stake in WorldPay to GTCR, a Chicago buyout shop. The transaction helped FIS cut its total debt, which had ballooned to about $19.1 billion at the end of 2023, to about $10 billion once the sale was completed. As of March 31, FIS debt stood at $11.2 billion while its leverage ratio was about 2.7 times, a spokesman said.', ""The deleveraging means FIS is reinstating its M&A agenda, Ferris said. The Jacksonville company provides fintech software to merchants, banks, and capital markets firms. FIS is allocating about $1 billion a year to deals and will be targeting small, synergistic products that the company currently doesn’t have or doesn’t have enough time to build organically, she said. Its purchase last year of Bond Financial Technologies, a banking-as-a-service startup, was an acquihire—something FIS is not seeking to replicate this time around. “We're really looking for products or businesses that have revenues and EBITDA and a proven business model,” Ferris said."", ""Any acquisitions will come in areas that FIS is looking to grow, like digital and payments capabilities in the banking space, and commercial lending technology in the capital markets sector, she said. FIS won’t be looking to do one big transaction but multiple, smaller deals. For a company to attract FIS’s interest, they should be at least $150 million to $200 million in revenue or it's “really not a business but just a product and it doesn't have enough customers for us,” Ferris said."", 'Ferris spoke to Fortune last week after capping a triumphant investor day. FIS on March 6 reported first quarter earnings that surpassed expectations. The results marked the fifth quarter during Ferris’s tenure that FIS has met or beat earnings expectations. FIS also announced the launch of Atelio, which lets financial institutions, businesses and software developers embed financial services into their offerings. Atelio already has three customers: KeyBank, College Ave and RoyalPay. (Atelio includes execs from Bond including Roy Ng, co-founder and CEO of Bond, who is EVP, chief business officer of FIS Platform and Enterprise Solutions.)', ""“It's been a very busy first 18 months, both internal to FIS and external. I'm really pleased with where we are,” Ferris said."", 'Ferris’ start as FIS’s CEO wasn’t an easy one. She was handed the reins of a large, publicly traded fintech that was struggling. FIS’s heavy debt load meant the company could complete only one acquisition, its roughly $800 million buy of Payrix in 2021, from 2019 to 2022.', 'In February 2023, just months after Ferris became CEO, FIS announced plans to spin off WorldPay. It launched a sales process that April and had a buyer for WorldPay signed by July, she said. The WorldPay process generated lots of interest, especially among private equity firms, with Advent International rumored to be in the running. Ferris wouldn’t comment. “We moved fast. Deals die if they take a long time,” she said.', 'The decision to sell a majority of WorldPay meant Ferris was undoing one of the biggest payments deals of 2019. There were several that year. Fiserv acquired First Data for $22 billion, while Global Payments scooped up TSYS for $21.5 billion and Worldline bought Ingenico for 7.8 billion euros.', 'FIS buying WorldPay “was a poor decision,” said Dan Dolev, a senior analyst in fintech equity research at Mizuho Securities USA. FIS bought WorldPay at a peak moment of consolidation for processors. WorldPay didn’t have a branded point of sale terminal for small business, like Fiserv has with Clover or Square has with Square POS, Dolev said. All of WorldPay’s competitors had a branded POS, making it tough for it to compete, Dolev said.', '“[Ferris] was very courageous to unwind the merger,” Dolev said. Shares of FIS have also rebounded after dropping to a 52-week low of $47.16 in October. The stock on Tuesday ended at $76.39, up about 62%.', 'What is FIS?', 'FIS is one of the world’s biggest financial services companies. Its software powers many of the biggest private equity firms and 95% of the Forbes 2024 World’s Best Bank list, Ferris said. FIS technology “underpins the entire financial services industry,” she said.', ""FIS is so important that in March 2023, when several regional banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, collapsed, many large and small banks CEOs reached out to Ferris to make sure their systems were kept running smoothly, she said. Such responsibility is an honor and privilege that Ferris says she takes seriously: “I'm a steward of FIS… I’m making sure that we're here every day for our clients.”"", 'Ferris, who has spent her whole career in finance, including as the CFO of WorldPay, doesn’t think there was a banking crisis in 2023. The financial system is very strong, according to Ferris.', '“In fact, what we saw were more accounts opened across the entire banking system. There were more deposit accounts opened versus this notion that people were drawing their money down and fleeing and putting it outside their banks,” she said.', ""Ferris has spent her whole career in finance and has worn many hats. She’s been a CFO, a chief operating officer, a president and now CEO of one of the biggest fintechs.\xa0 This makes her the most powerful woman in fintech, an honor that Ferris said she doesn’t think about. “It's always been a bunch of guys in a room. Because I grew up that way, it doesn't really bother me,” she said."", ""When it comes to peers, Ferris points to Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citigroup, who she said is “a badass.” As the only woman running one of the largest banks, Fraser has a tough job, Ferris said. “I think she's amazing,” she said."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Strong execution and more accounts should continue to fuel top-line growth in the Banking Segment. The company expects banking-adjusted revenues to grow between 3% and 3.5% in 2024. Moreover, the recent banking uncertainty is boding well for FIS, leading to growth in accounts on file serviced on its platforms and hence rising banking revenues. Growth in existing clients, the contribution of high-growth products and tuck-in acquisitions are expected to fuel revenue growth in the mid-term of around 3.5-4.5%.', 'The company continues to benefit from increasing Capital Market revenues in the first quarter of 2024. It expects revenues in this segment to grow in the range of 6.5-7% in 2024. The company’s continued investments in emerging platforms like artificial intelligence and blockchain technology should continue to add value to its services. Expanding into the non-core sub-segment, which accounts for 30% of the total segment’s revenues, bodes well. Management expects medium-term revenue growth of 7.5-8.5%. Cross-selling of banking products to capital markets clients highlights a $300 million revenue opportunity, posing the segment well for growth.', 'The company focuses on top-tier strategic partnerships and future-proof underlying technologies to grow its operations. The company’s growing footprint in the crypto market is praiseworthy. It has partnered with cryptocurrency platforms like Crypto.com and OKCoin to support their respective global expansions. Further, its partnership with bitcoin-focused financial services and technology provider NYDIG is likely to increase traffic to its Digital One Mobile application. It recently unveiled Atelio to enable clients to embed financial services in their offerings. It expects embedded finance TAM’s revenues to be around $230 billion by 2025.', 'Fidelity National often undertakes shareholder value-boosting measures. In the first quarter, the company returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and $209 million in the form of dividends. Management aims to return a minimum of roughly $4 billion to its shareholders through share buybacks by the end of 2024. The company aims to maintain a 35% dividend payout ratio in 2024. It has a dividend yield of 1.9%, higher than the industry’s average of 0.8%.', 'The company does not move away from shedding non-core assets to boost efficiency and profitability. It completed a majority stake divestiture in Worldpay in the first quarter of 2024.', 'However, there are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on. The company is undertaking a multi-year modernization initiative for its platforms and applications following the successful consolidation of data centers and the modernization of its IT infrastructure.

Over the very long term, REITs have outperformed stocks. While they have lagged the market in recent years, a near-term catalyst could give the sector a jolt.', 'Several top-notch REITs, including Agree Realty (NYSE: ADC), Prologis (NYSE: PLD), and EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR), are currently trading near 52-week lows. That makes them look like great buys, given their compelling dividend yields, growth outlooks, and the potential near-term catalyst of falling interest rates. ', ""Agree Realty's stock price sits about 13% below its 52-week-high, close to its low point for the year. That has pushed the retail REIT's dividend yield up to 5%, significantly higher than the S&P 500's 1.4% dividend yield. "", ""Higher interest rates are the main factor weighing on Agree Realty. They've driven down real estate values and increased borrowing costs, making it more challenging for REITs to make new investments. "", 'However, the REIT expects to invest about $600 million into new properties this year, thanks to its strong balance sheet, post-dividend free cash flow, and timely funding. That investment level supports its view it can grow its funds from operations (FFO) by 4% to 5% this year. ', 'It can deliver that solid growth rate without deviating from its core strategy or increasing its risk profile. That should enable Agree Realty to continue increasing its dividend. Meanwhile, as interest rates fall (which could occur later this year), it would take some pressure off its stock price and enable the REIT to ramp up its investment volume. ', ""Prologis stock currently sits more than 20% below its 52-week high, close to its low for the year. That sell-off has driven the leading industrial REIT's dividend yield up to 3.6%. "", 'The company is battling a couple of near-term headwinds, which caused it to lower its full-year outlook. CEO Hamid Moghadam commented in the first-quarter earnings press release: ', 'While operating conditions are healthy in the majority of our markets, customers remain focused on controlling costs, which is weighing on decision making and the pace of leasing. A volatile and persistently high interest rate environment, together with mounting geopolitical concerns, contribute to this indecision and its short-term effect on net absorption.', 'However, the company only expects this headwind to last a quarter or two. It remains very positive about its long-term outlook due to strong demand tailwinds and barriers to new supply. ', 'Prologis sees its core FFO growing by 9% to 11% per share annually through 2026 (including by around 8% this year). That should enable it to continue growing its dividend at a healthy rate. With its headwinds likely to fade later this year, Prologis looks like a steal near its 52-week low. ', 'EPR Properties stock has slumped 14% below its 52-week high, putting it close to its bottom over the past year. The sell-off has driven its dividend yield up over 8%. ', 'The REIT focused on experiential real estate has had to slow its investment pace due to the impact of high interest rates on its cost of capital. The company only expects to invest $200 million to $300 million this year, which is the level it can fund with post-dividend free cash flow, capital recycling, and cash on hand. ', ""It's investing that money into high-return development and redevelopment projects and select acquisitions. That's still enough money to grow its FFO by more than 3% per share this year. This growth outlook supported the company's decision to raise its already enticing monthly dividend by 3.6% earlier this year. "", 'EPR Properties has already lined up $220 million of experiential development and redevelopment projects it expects to fund over the next two years. As interest rates fall, the company should be able to ramp up its acquisition volume. That would enable it to grow even faster in the future, allowing it to continue increasing its attractive dividend. ', 'Many high-quality REITs, including Agree Realty, Prologis, and EPR Properties, are currently trading near their 52-week lows due to persistently high interest rates. Because of that, investors can scoop up these magnificent investments at bargain prices, enabling them to lock in attractive dividend yields. That potentially sets them up to earn high total returns in the coming years as REIT values improve, and they continue growing their high-yielding dividends.', 'Before you buy stock in Agree Realty, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Agree Realty wasn’t one of them.

However, until it does, many analysts are optimistic about overlooked companies that could gain just as much as the most obvious high-growth stocks. Though the implied upside varies greatly in the following trio (VRT, DELL, PLD), I would keep tabs on the following stocks as analysts look to reward companies that are able to make money from AI bets sooner rather than in the distant future.', 'Indeed, getting in on the AI boom entails a great deal of investment. And it’s about time that such bets had a clearer payoff. With rates likely to stay elevated for another year, we’ll need to see some of those “strategic” AI-related investments translate into cash flows. Therefore, in this piece, we’ll check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool below to check in with three AI-flavored plays that retain their Strong Buy ratings from the analyst community.', 'Shares of data center infrastructure and services provider Vertiv will not be for the faint of heart after skyrocketing more than 670% since its April 2023 lows. Undoubtedly, the stock seems just too hot to handle, but, in many ways, the company’s story seems to “rhyme” with that of the AI chip makers. More demand for AI applications means more AI chips are needed. And more AI chips mean more up-to-speed data center demand.', 'Given said tailwinds, I’d be bullish had it not been for the hefty multiple—90.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) at writing—and the profound momentum behind the stock. For now, I’m sitting on the sidelines with a neutral position, but I would be tempted to jump into VRT stock on a steep pullback.', 'Given booming AI-led infrastructure demand, and the more palatable forward P/E of 40.8 times, VRT shareholders may have enough reason to justify sticking by the name. Add the recently-raised full-year guidance for sales and adjusted operating profit into the equation, and it certainly seems like Vertiv’s a winner poised to continue winning. Citigroup (NYSE:C) analyst Andrew Kaplowitz certainly seems to think so, with his Street-high price target of $110.00, implying over 11% upside from here.', 'Of course, the stakes remain high, especially if investors call for heavy spenders on AI to pull back ever so slightly. If there’s one thing we learned this quarterly earnings season, it’s that AI innovation costs money, lots of money. And perhaps investors want balance rather than sheer aggression on spending (I’m looking at you, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)).', 'Vertiv stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average VRT stock price target\xa0of $97.00 implies 1.75% downside potential.', 'The longtime personal computer (PC) and server firm Dell Technologies has shown us that it can compete in the AI revolution. The stock caught many by shock as it added to last year’s gains with a notable quarterly beat that helped contribute to the massive 73% year-to-date surge in shares. Even after its historic rally, I’m more inclined to stay bullish on the stock, as it’s clearly an AI play that’s been slept on by far too many market participants.', 'Unfortunately, the biggest upside surprise is already in, with numerous analysts already having re-evaluated the firm to the upside for its AI server prowess. Like Vertiv, Dell is an AI hardware player that’s starting to feel the heat of the AI boom. And the good news is that there may still be many more quarters that could feel the lift of AI server demand. Further, unlike some of the AI software developers, it seems like the hardware players are ready to profit from the boom in a span measured in quarters rather than years.', 'Dell isn’t just focused on feeding AI server demand with the hottest new GPUs; it also stands out to win as it readies its newest PC slate for a potential on-device AI supercycle. Of course, demand for personal AI hardware could extend for many years.', 'Dell stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 11 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average DELL stock price target\xa0of $122.25 implies 8.9% downside potential.', 'Next, we have Prologis, a logistics real estate investment trust (REIT) that has been betting on data centers. PLD stock has been stuck in a multi-year rut since imploding back in 2022. Now down more than 36% from its all-time high, thanks to the headwind of higher interest rates and softening demand for warehouse space, I think now seems like an opportune time to go against the grain.', 'Shares sport a bountiful 3.6% yield, which is pretty good for a “growthy” REIT that will live to see better days, likely when consumers are in a healthy enough spot to spend more on e-commerce platforms. All things considered, I am bullish despite warehouse headwinds that may stick around for many quarters to come.', 'Even in the face of industry challenges, Prologis is ready to keep investing in its high-growth future. Earlier this year, the firm announced its intention to bet $25 billion on data centers. That’s a big deal that punches Prologis’ ticket to the AI bandwagon. Warehouses are out, and data centers are in. As warehouse demand continues to drag, the REIT will diversify into a timelier arena that could help reverse its stock trend well before the demand picks up.', 'In these early stages of the AI boom, the world needs more data centers. Though expensive, I see Prologis’ big bet on the data center as having the potential to pay massive dividends.', 'Prologis stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 13 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average PLD stock price target\xa0of $132.07 implies 22% upside potential.', 'There are some less-obvious companies that stand to profit big from the AI revolution. As investors insist on seeing AI bets turn into dollar bills, I expect the following trio of data center plays could gain more love on Wall Street. Of the trio, investors expect the most from PLD stock.', 'Disclosure']"

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) share price is up 49% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 11% in that time."", ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service ', 'While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""Over half a decade, United Parcel Service managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.7% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on United Parcel Service's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", 'As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for United Parcel Service the TSR over the last 5 years was 75%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""Investors in United Parcel Service had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.3% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 29%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 12% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for United Parcel Service (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", 'United Parcel Service is not the only stock insiders are buying.

It's no wonder that individual investors pay close attention to his moves to find potential ideas for their own portfolios."", ""The conglomerate's massive $367 billion equity portfolio now includes stakes in dozens of businesses. But I think one holding of the Oracle of Omaha in particular should be on your radar right now: American Express (NYSE: AXP)."", ""Many people believe we are in uncertain economic times. Interest rates are high. Inflation, while much lower than its recent peaks, appears stuck at levels above the Federal Reserve's target range of 2%. And there are a lot of questions about whether the U.S. will enter a recession sometime soon."", 'Forget about the macro situation. American Express continues to do well regardless of what the backdrop looks like.', 'The credit card giant processed $419 billion in payment volume in the first three months of 2024. Boosted by robust cross-border activity, that figure was up 5% year over year. Because Amex earns more fees the more that its cards are used, higher payment volume is a key trend that drives business success.', 'This helped increase revenue by 11% in Q1. Management has forecast that the top line will grow by 10% (at the midpoint of its projection range) for the full year. American Express has no issues when it comes to profitability. Diluted earnings per share were $3.33 in the first quarter, up from $2.40 in the year-ago period.', ""These headline metrics indicate a company that's firing on all cylinders today."", ""American Express's strong financial results are nothing new. In fact, the business's lasting success is supported by what I believe are its two most important competitive strengths. "", ""The first is Amex's powerful brand, which is arguably one of the most recognized in the world -- not only in the financial services sector, but in general. Part of that comes from being around for nearly two centuries. It also doesn't hurt that American Express presents itself as a premium brand and targets higher-income consumers."", 'American Express operates its own payments system. Therefore, it also benefits from network effects. As more merchants plug into the platform, being an Amex cardholder becomes more valuable to consumers because they have more places where they can use their cards. And as the number of cardholders grows, merchants have greater incentives to accept Amex as a method of payment.', ""When trying to find high-quality stocks to buy and hold for the long term, investors should look for companies that possess economic moats -- inherent advantages that allow them to defend against competition. Buffett certainly does. I believe Amex's brand and the network effects that the business benefits from are two top factors that he appreciates about Amex, and help explain why Berkshire Hathaway owns a whopping 21% of its shares outstanding."", ""Anyone who takes the time to analyze American Express will likely come away impressed. The company has a long and successful history. Even so, its stock looks reasonably valued right now, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 20. While that's slightly above its trailing five- and 10-year averages, the shares are still cheaper than the 27 average for the S&P 500 -- even though it's easy to argue that American Express is an above-average company."", ""If you have $100 to invest now, this business should be on your radar. It's the best Buffett stock to buy."", 'Before you buy stock in American Express, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and American Express wasn’t one of them.

Two of its more notable holdings are oil giants Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). While oil stocks have fallen out of favor for most investors, they rank as two of Buffett's top holdings (fifth- and sixth-largest, respectively), comprising nearly 10% of its investment portfolio."", ""Given Buffett's success as an investor, many of his followers are likely considering adding one of these oil stocks to their portfolio. Here are some factors that make one of these Buffett oil stocks stand out as a potentially better option for many investors."", ""Chevron and Occidental are two of the largest oil companies in the country. However, Chevron is by far the largest, with a nearly $320 billion enterprise value compared to Occidental's at over $80 billion."", ""Chevron has a much higher production rate (3.35 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter compared to 1.17 million barrels of oil equivalent per day for Occidental) and a much more diversified business (it's a globally integrated energy company, while Occidental Petroleum is mainly a U.S.-focused independent producer)."", ""Both energy companies are investing heavily to grow even bigger. Occidental agreed to buy CrownRock in a $12 billion deal last year to strengthen its already top-tier position in the Permian Basin. That acquisition will increase its production by 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and its annual free cash flow by $1 billion, assuming oil averages $70 per barrel (it's currently closer to $80)."", ""Occidental is also investing money to expand its chemicals businesses and build a leading carbon capture and storage platform. The company's investments will grow its non-oil earnings by over $1 billion by 2026. Meanwhile, the CrownRock deal and its oil and gas investments should grow the earnings of its legacy oil business in the coming years as long as commodity prices cooperate."", ""Chevron has also agreed to a needle-moving deal. It's working to buy Hess (NYSE: HES) for nearly $60 billion. That acquisition would boost its free cash flow per share starting next year and extend its production and free-cash-flow growth outlook into the 2030s. However, the deal faces some obstacles, though the company remains confident it will close the transaction."", 'Chevron is also investing heavily in growing its traditional energy business and lower carbon energy platforms (carbon capture, hydrogen, and biofuels). Chevron can grow its free cash flow at a more than 10% annual rate through 2027 without Hess while doubling its free cash flow if it closes that needle-moving deal (assuming oil averages around $70 a barrel).', ""Chevron is bigger and more diversified than Occidental, which lowers its risk profile. The oil behemoth further reduces risk by having a fortress-like balance sheet. The company ended the first quarter with $6.3 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet against $21.8 billion of debt. That put its leverage ratio at 12%, or 8.8% on a net basis after adjusting for its cash. That's significantly below its long-term target range of 20%-25%."", ""On the other hand, Occidental ended the first quarter with $18.5 billion of debt and about $1.2 billion of cash. That exceeded the company's long-term target to get debt below $15 billion."", ""The company's debt will balloon once it closes its CrownRock deal. Occidental intends to issue $9.1 billion of new debt to fund the transaction, in addition to assuming $1.2 billion of CrownRock's existing debt. The oil company plans to sell $4.5 billion-$6 billion in assets following the deal to help reduce debt and maintain its investment-grade credit rating. The company's strategy of using debt to fund a deal is worth noting because it has backfired in the past."", ""Contrast that with Chevron's approach. Its proposed Hess acquisition is an all-stock deal valued at $53 billion (plus the assumption of Hess's roughly $7 billion debt). Chevron will preserve its fortress-like balance sheet by using its stock to fund the deal. The company's approach will allow it to continue growing its dividend and repurchase shares, even if oil prices slump."", 'Warren Buffett loves Occidental Petroleum, which he\'s likened to other ""forever stocks"" in his portfolio. However, that doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s the right oil stock for you. It has a higher risk profile than Chevron, which will only increase after it closes its debt-funded deal for CrownRock. Because of that, Chevron is the better oil stock for those seeking a lower-risk way to follow Buffett and invest in the oil patch.', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

In value terms, exports fell 19.8% to €600m ($646.44m), according to the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV).', 'Exports have been, as Bodegas de Argentina puts it, “decimated” by unreliable exchange rates, various tax regimes and the country’s lack of free-trade agreements. On average, Argentine-wine exporters pay 5% of their invoicing annually in market-entry tariffs.', 'In January, an 8% invoice tax – which had been dropped from 4.5% to 0% in September – was proposed under the new government’s reforms. Bodegas de Argentina warned at the time the proposals would “deepen the fall in the already decimated sales abroad with the consequent increase in wine stocks and decreases in the prices of raw materials”.', 'Kuret says: “Our chamber worked extensively with the authorities to prevent the project from materialising and we succeeded in halting its progress. At present, we have 0% export taxes.”', 'Catena says Argentina’s exchange rate has “improved somewhat”, adding: “With the previous government, there were times when we were getting less than half the exchange rate in pesos and at times, we were not even able to buy back dollars to buy things like barrels or pay our employees outside of Argentina.”', 'Domestically, the situation is more complex. Catena Zapata is having to revise pricing monthly and Catena fears changing exchange rates may impact tourism as travellers get fewer pesos for their dollars.', 'But she remains hopeful that with a “stable” economy and politics over the next two years, “2026 could be a much better year”.', 'While domestic pricing means it can be more profitable to export, Andrej Razumovsky, the CEO of biodynamic winery Alpamanta in Luján de Cuyo, Mendoza, warns against putting all efforts into one or the other.', ""“It's an ongoing thing depending on the devaluation, the inflation, the exchange rate,” he says. “You can never just rely on being an export-oriented wine producer, because tomorrow suddenly it will not be profitable, and then you have to push the domestic market.”"", 'Razumovsky exports his wines to 30 countries, selling most in the US, Norway and Sweden. He says the UK is “the most attractive market for New-World wines” in Europe. “They are very open minded in terms of the New World,” he says. “It is a huge market.”', 'After a slow 2023, Catena says she is optimistic for 2024 in most markets, especially in Latin America. “There is a growing luxury consumer that likes to drink local in Latin America – and Argentina is considered local in Latin America as a whole,” she says.', 'Estela Perinetti, founder of Uco Valley-based Las Estelas, also touts the potential of Latin America. After only a few operational years, the brand is sold in the UK, the US and Germany but also in Brazil, Uruguay and Peru. Perinetti says it’s easier for neighbouring, Spanish-speaking countries to understand both the language on the labels and the wine style – listing grape varieties rather than regions or appellations.', ""“When people look at French wine, or even Italian wine, they don't know where Pauillac is or what Saint-Esteph is. What is Romanée-Conti – besides being very expensive?” she says."", 'For Kuret at the Bodegas de Argentina, the greatest challenge for Argentine winemakers is shifting from producing wine to becoming “designers of products” that stand out against international competition. “It’s a challenge that often surpasses their professional capacity to produce a good wine. Poor understanding of the consumer can lead to undesirable outcomes,” he says.', 'A consultant and ex-Catena winemaker, Perinetti has always grown and sold grapes on her family vineyards but launched Las Estelas five years ago. She says creating a brand can improve margins and protect growers from deflating grape prices.', '“For growers, producers, everyone, inflation is tough. The economic conditions are difficult to plan [for]. The dollar export has changed dramatically,” she says. “It’s not easy but we still keep doing it because the alternative is to sell everything. That’s not something we will do.', '“The vineyards have been in the family for 82 years and have suffered many crises… If we have four, or five years more – we will try to survive. My idea was to put a brand on what we are doing.”', 'Perinetti uses 40-45% of the grapes she produces – bottling around 100,000 (8,300 nine-litre cases) under the Las Estelas brand from a capacity of 250,00 bottles. She hopes within a few years to be able to use all of her grapes.', 'Creating a brand has allowed Perinetti “not to totally be a slave of big companies”. She says said during tough economic times “the ones that suffer are the growers. The big companies [lower] the prices of the grapes and some people do not survive”.', ""Selling high-quality grapes is not cost-effective in Argentina, Perinetti says, as the price does not increase sufficiently in line with the cost of producing them. “[Financially] it's better to have more production and a medium quality but, with the soil I have, I cannot do it. I have a very poor soil and relatively extreme conditions,” she explains."", 'Malbec forms around a quarter (47,000 hectares) of Argentina’s total vineyard plantings, Wines Of Argentina estimates.', 'More Malbec – and more-expensive Malbec – is exported than drunk locally. Last year, the variety formed 69.3% of total exports in volume terms according to the National Institute of Viticulture. When narrowed down to bottled wine, Malbec formed 71% of exports in volume (861,488 hectolitres) and 91% of total value ($373.3m).', 'Catena does not see a challenger for the country’s flagship varietal any time soon – instead seeing space for more styles of Malbec. “Malbec is like dark chocolate or Cabernet Sauvignon,” she says. “These are flavours that humans like because they are delicious and distinctive.”', 'Catena’s father, Nicolás, is widely credited with putting Argentine Malbec on the world map in the 1990s and she says the grape “has not gone through a slowdown since”.', '“What’s exciting now is that we can taste Malbec from many parts of Mendoza and Argentina (different soils, altitudes, and latitudes),” she says.', 'The company’s research centre, The Catena Institute, has mapped regional Malbec variations for each of Argentina’s 110 appellations. Around 90% of the country’s vines are massale (a method of growing where the best vines are selected over the years to produce better, or desirable, new vines) and ungrafted. “This genetic diversity combined with the diversity of altitude and soils combines to give endless diversity of flavour for Malbec and other varieties,” Catena says. “We have only just started to see the diversity of terroir that Argentina can offer.”', 'Catena says “preserving genetic diversity” of Malbec is one of the company’s key areas for investment. “The diverse massale selections of Malbec only exist in Argentina, and I think there are part of the elegance and texture behind Argentine Malbec. It would be virtually impossible for any other country to reproduce this kind of genetic diversity,” she says.', 'While Catena says Malbec’s popularity remains strong domestically, others have noticed a move away from it as locals want to try something new.', 'Las Estelas says Malbec is “probably the most difficult wine I have to sell” in Argentina. Instead, the domestic market is more interested in Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Syrah.', '“The [domestic] market is quite open to diversity. They look for it,” she says. “In Argentina, we drink mainly local Argentine wines because the portfolio of international wine is very small, the taxes are huge, so the prices for us are crazy.”', 'Mendoza-headquartered Grupo Avinea says Cabernet Franc has the potential to become the “second best” red grape from Argentina in the medium- or long-term, having seen keen interest in the variety domestically.', 'Andres Valero, head of sustainability and CSR at Grupo Avinea, says white varieties like Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio have also seen “a lot of success” in its domestic market. The group is now looking to increase exports of these wines.', 'Grupo Avinea, which owns Bodegas Argento, is one of the largest producers of Pinot Grigio in Mendoza but only exports the wines to a handful of markets due to intense competition – especially from Italy.', 'When produced in cooler southern regions, like Patagonia, Valero says Argentine Pinot Grigio can be similar to European styles but is still tricky to sell in some markets. “It’s difficult to compete with Italy,” he says. “Even when you have the same price point – and you have a better quality for the same price point.”', 'Razumovsky at Alpamanta is noting rising interest in natural wines and more producers making it. His portfolio is now 50-50 natural and “classic” wines and he says natural wines have taken off in popularity in the last two or three years, with natural-wine bars and shops popping up since the pandemic – though not to the scale of London or New York.', ""While he thinks the overall natural wine category will stay strong, he says Pet-Nats are “another story”. With high margins to be made on the sparkling wines, competition is fierce and the sub-category at risk of falling out of fashion, he says. “It’s something that is very trendy at the moment. I don't think that it will last forever. There's already some markets that that are seeing a turn.”"", 'Water scarcity is one of the most pressing environmental issues facing winemakers in Argentina.', '“What we’re seeing very clearly in Mendoza, is changing availability of water,” says Valero. Mendoza’s vineyards are irrigated by snow melt from the Andes, which feeds into rivers and aquifers.', 'Valero says for over a decade the snow has been 20-30% – and some years even 50% – less than average. Water for production is getting scarcer and wineries with wells are forced to dig deeper for supplies.', 'Grupo Avinea and Catena both use drip irrigation – which uses around 50-70% less water than “traditional but wasteful” flood irrigation.', '“This is one of the situations where ‘tradition’ goes against preservation, and where an innovation as simple as drip irrigation can have a large impact,” Catena says. “We also capture rainwater and have created ‘represas’ or small reservoir lakes, in all our family-owned vineyards. Water is stored in these reservoirs to be used during the growing season, when the vines are working hardest.”', 'However, Valero points out growers with water access often choose to use flooding to save on energy and installation costs.', 'Increasingly erratic weather events have also plagued Argentina’s last few harvests.', 'In 2023, Argentina’s wine production fell to a six-decade low of 8.8 mhl – down 23% on 2022. The OIV said the result was “primarily” due to spring frosts and hailstorms. “There were a lot of climatic problems that we used to have but not so many times and not so severe,” Valero says.', 'Razumovsky says when he started Alpamanta there was a spring frost every decade but now they are the norm. A spring frost can damage vines during the critical budding stage, taking up to half of the year’s crop.', 'While Argentina is facing its fair share of headwinds, its winemakers remain hopeful things will improve – and confident in the quality of their wines. “Argentina is like the Galapagos of wine – the diversity is out in the open, in all the commercial vineyards,” says Catena. “Other countries have most of this diversity in research institutes.” With a broad portfolio and thirst to expand internationally, Kuret says: “Argentina has all the conditions to grow.”', '""Argentina winemakers talk inflation, exports and future of Malbec"" was originally created and published by Just Drinks, a GlobalData owned brand.', '', '\xa0', 'The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

I think as we looked at the decision back then, and certainly as we view it today, one of the key variables was ensuring that we had clear runway on the loan maturity front. And I think the bond transaction did a couple of things when it reinforced the fact that we can run the company with ample liquidity for the foreseeable future, keeping that line of credit close to zero. Second, it really did reinforce to all of our fixed income stakeholders on the unsecured side that Brandywine is committed to the unsecured marketplace.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Marketing Dive newsletter.', 'With Memorial Day just around the bend, Pepsi is staking a claim as the superior soft drink for grilling as part of a long-running platform centered on food pairings. The brand enlisted Bobby Flay for the effort that positions its beverages as the ideal drink to go with burgers, hot dogs and other cookout fare. The celebrity chef helped develop two new limited-time offerings, Pepsi Lime and Pepsi Peach, that are intended to complement meals on the grill and will be available at national retail throughout the summer, differing from past seasonal LTO strategies from the marketer that had narrower releases.', 'Aligned with Pepsi’s focus on encouraging “unapologetic enjoyment,” messaging for the campaign, titled “Grills Night Out,” emphasizes that grilling doesn’t need to be reserved for major holidays like Fourth of July. Instead, Pepsi is pushing people to break out the charcoal or propane as an everyday occasion, citing Harris Poll data that revealed 84% of consumers expect to grill more this year compared to 2023.', ""“It doesn't always have to be a big, 30-person event. It can be just on a Tuesday,” said Pepsi CMO Todd Kaplan in an interview."", 'Creative is anchored by a trio of TV commercials that walk through the grilling process with backing from retro pop tunes including “Hot Stuff” by Donna Summer and “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)” by Frankie Vallie & The Four Seasons. The first spot, “Prep,” stars Flay as he dons his signature apron and demonstrates his culinary skills, throwing in some dance moves for good measure. Follow-up ads “Cook” and “Enjoy” keep the animated energy going as people gather in backyards and on patios to commiserate over seared meats, veggies and Pepsi. A Spanish-language spot, “Carne Asada, Parrillada o Asado,” is part of Pepsi’s outreach to Hispanic consumers.', 'In addition, Flay features in a social video series to share grill tips and guides for preparing dishes such as his Green Chili Burger. Flay was appointed as Pepsi ambassador in April, a response to how food content and tastemakers are increasingly popular with consumers, according to Kaplan.', '“Half of the stuff I see on my social channels [is] people prepping food, eating food,” said Kaplan. “Food culture is really hitting a peak of interest right now in the country.”', 'Other media elements of “Grills Night Out” span in-store displays, digital content shorts and stunts, while Pepsi has partnered with Instacart for a giveaway running through May 19 that will see winners in New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles secure jumbo-sized orders of grilling essentials. VaynerMedia, Direct Focus and Acceleration Community of Companies aided on the campaign launching for a key sales window for soda.', '“As you think of it from a category standpoint, the summer is one of the biggest timeframes. We want to make sure our brand is top of mind,” said Kaplan. “It’s important to drive that deeper association.”', '“Grills Night out,” a pun on “girls night out,” extends a #BetterWithPepsi platform that debuted in 2021 and argues the PepsiCo marketer’s beverages are the best complement for a variety of meals. The original campaign referenced chief rival Coke’s relationship with leading fast-food chains through canny ads that used the restaurants’ mascots and iconography to instead promote Pepsi.', '#BetterWithPepsi has changed tactically over the years, with some of the combative edge turned down. Last summer’s #BetterWithPepsi push starred competitive eater Joey Chestnut and hawked a ketchup-inspired beverage called Colachup for July Fourth. Pepsi Lime and Pepsi Peach, which were created in collaboration with Flay, are more conventional flavors that will have wider availability to consumers. The idea is that the sweetness of peach and sharpness of lime amplify the flavors in grilled dishes, while Pepsi’s citric acid content and carbonation can break down grease and aid with digestion.', '“These are actually available for sale at retailers everywhere nationally all summer long whereas some of the stuff we’ve done in the past were more limited drops,” said Kaplan.', 'Shifting the LTO approach comes as marketing activity in the soft drink category is again on the rise, with Coke recently introducing its first permanent flavor addition in years and Sprite going toe-to-toe with Starry, PepsiCo’s new lemon-lime contender. Alcohol giants like Anheuser-Busch and Molson Coors also try to own cookout season, but Pepsi sees room for multiple players as part of its argument that grilling should be a more casual, regular habit versus something done once in a blue moon.', '“It’s not always about having a bender on a Saturday night,” said Kaplan. “Grilling is such a specific occasion that we know we have the right to win.”']"

So we’re doing that in a much bigger way with Gap,” said Katherine Kleveland, adding that there will also be digital marketing and store installations rolling out at the Gap at The Grove in L.A. and beyond.', 'The sisters started working on the collection about a year ago, before Richard Dickson was announced as CEO and president of the San Francisco-based, $16 billion corporation, and before Zac Posen was appointed creative director.', 'Dickson’s prescription for turning around Gap Inc. — giving each brand a stronger identity, leveraging music and pop culture to drive relevance and fashion, and working to champion original, trend-right products — seems to be gathering momentum, with Gap swinging back into the black during the fourth quarter.', 'The Klevelands left the door open to an ongoing collaboration with the retailer: “They did say when they placed their final buy it was going to be their biggest collaboration to date structured in this way. The amount of doors nearly doubled our initial projection,” Margaret Kleveland said. “Throughout the working process, we got so much good feedback and they were so thrilled with the presentation that…let’s say, it’s evolved.”', 'The Gap collection is a milestone for Dôen, not yet 10 years old, and starting to look wider for expansion, including internationally.

These solutions are specifically designed to assist enterprises in mitigating risk and safeguarding their data across hybrid, multi-cloud environments and workloads.Leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation techniques, these solutions bring together human expertise and advanced technologies for faster response, efficiency and transparency through a holistic approach to secure hybrid cloud environments. Moreover, a higher demand for data computing at the edge, triggered by the rapid deployment of 5G and the proliferation of IoT devices, has forced tech firms to ensure their resiliency, performance, security and compliance standards.In addition to organic growth, technology firms are gradually leaning toward the inorganic route to bolster their cybersecurity domain. The merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy heralds a new era of innovation in AI-driven cybersecurity solutions. As the companies join forces, their complementary strengths are poised to reshape the industry landscape, delivering enhanced value to customers and stakeholders alike.Let us delve a little deep for a brief analysis of three such notable transactions in 2024 to get an essence of the sector developments.Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO acquired Splunk Inc. in March in a transaction valued at $28 billion. Splunk's expertise in advanced AI-powered solutions stands to greatly enhance Cisco's AI-driven service offerings. By leveraging Splunk's capabilities, Cisco aims to accelerate the development of next-generation solutions, optimizing data value and reinforcing security analytics.This strategic alignment reflects industry trends, where the convergence of cybersecurity and AI is increasingly paramount. As organizations navigate complex digital ecosystems, the demand for AI-driven security solutions continues to surge. By integrating Splunk's cutting-edge technologies, Cisco strengthens its position as a formidable player in this evolving landscape, poised to deliver innovative solutions tailored to meet evolving customer needs.From Splunk's perspective, the merger represents a significant win-win scenario. It provides access to Cisco's robust resources and global reach, facilitating accelerated research and development initiatives. Moreover, the collaboration positions Splunk at the forefront of AI innovation, enabling the creation of synergistic solutions that address the evolving cybersecurity challenges faced by enterprises worldwide."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'In April, International Business Machines Corporation IBM inked an agreement to acquire HashiCorp Inc. HCP. Based in California, HashiCorp is a software company that enables organizations to efficiently automate multi-cloud and hybrid environments with its Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management solutions.With a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which, in turn, has led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and highly interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. IBM’s acquisition of HCP is a probable ploy to address these issues.Representing an enterprise value of $6.4 billion, the deal will significantly augment IBM’s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. Moreover, HashiCorp’s tool sets will likely complement IBM RedHat’s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management. The integration of HCP’s cloud software capabilities will bolster IBM’s hybrid multi-cloud approach.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Earlier, in January, Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE inked a definitive agreement to acquire Juniper Networks, Inc.
