But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Unum Group (NYSE:UNM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Unum Group with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Unum Group Unum Group's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Unum Group managed to grow EPS by 17% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of Unum Group's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While revenue is looking a bit flat, the good news is EBIT margins improved by 3.9 percentage points to 17%, in the last twelve months. Which is a great look for the company.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Unum Group's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Unum Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Unum Group, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Holding US$70m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Should You Add Unum Group To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Unum Group is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Unum Group by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

1,cce42436-a5bf-3ee6-9dec-0ed54a4ee428,CTAS,2023-09-11,Investors Should Be Encouraged By Cintas' (NASDAQ:CTAS) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-encouraged-cintas-nasdaq-ctas-110053409.html,1694430053,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Cintas' (NASDAQ:CTAS) look very promising so lets take a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Cintas, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$8.5b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2023).Therefore, Cintas has an ROCE of 25%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.5% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Cintas roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Cintas compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Cintas here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsCintas is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 54% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Cintas' ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Cintas has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Cintas can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Cintas  that we think you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our introduction to dividends and the general economic climate, then check out S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Top 5 Stocks Sorted By Analyst Ratings. Dividends are one of the most stable ways that you can make money from the stock market. While most attention is often focused on stock share price appreciations and the potential to cash in at the right time, dividends mostly stay in the background. However, they provide investors the option to earn bond like payments for their stock ownership. Dividends are generally paid by larger and established companies with budgets that are capable of supporting investing in growth or by others that are structured to pay out most of their earnings from investment or other entities as dividends.Since there are thousands of stocks on the market, picking out only those that have consistently paid dividends for decades despite the prevailing economic environment is quite difficult. This becomes ever more important given the current economic environment. Inflation and the stock market have roiled decision making and created a tough environment for those that seek stability. Meteoric gains made by the big technology and mega-cap firms almost seemed to reverse and start a downward trend in August, and economists and analysts as a whole are now starting to favor a cautious approach towards the stock market. The simple reason behind this is that the rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to curtail historic inflation are historic themselves. The bank rate in the U.S. is now at a two decade high, and the fact that the economy has managed to weather the storm so far has surprised a lot of professionals.Dividends can prove to be crucial if they can provide stable income in a tough environment. At the same time, reinvesting dividends into the stock that pays it (after consulting certified professionals) can also enable one to grow wealth over the decades and have a nice nest egg waiting for retirement. There are multiple lists that track dividend companies, and one of the more popular ones is the S&amp;P500 Dividend Aristocrats. The list sets a rather high bar for entry, since not only does it include only those stocks that are part of the S&amp;P 500 index, but further narrows down the selection criteria to include only those firms that have grown their dividends consecutively for the past 25 years. The total returns of these stocks are naturally higher than the S&amp;P500, and except for some rare exceptions, lead and lag the index during periods of upturns and downturns, respectively.Story continuesNearly half of the S&amp;P500 Dividend Aristocrats are firms operating in the consumer staples and industrial sectors. This is unsurprising since these firms are either less prone to the negative effects of economic shocks or are large and established companies that generate stable revenue simply due to their scale and expensive long term capital investments. We've covered this elite list of stocks quite frequently as well.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Huntington Bancshares' shares on or after the 15th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.62 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Huntington Bancshares stock has a trailing yield of around 5.7% on the current share price of $10.87. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Huntington Bancshares's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Huntington Bancshares has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Huntington Bancshares's payout ratio is modest, at just 39% of profit.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Huntington Bancshares earnings per share are up 8.9% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Huntington Bancshares has lifted its dividend by approximately 15% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Huntington Bancshares? Huntington Bancshares has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. In summary, Huntington Bancshares appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Huntington Bancshares is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Huntington Bancshares and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our analysis of the recent events in the travel industry, then take a look at 5 Travel Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. The travel industry has seen disruption in one form or the other over the past four years, and a tough economic environment after the coronavirus pandemic has hampered recovery. Some sectors, such as airlines that were forced to fly routes just to keep them running and cruise companies that saw ships stranded at ports, faced crises that perhaps few would believe were possible before they happened.Like the broader economy, such as industrial production and logistics, the global benchmark crude oil prices determine the ease of the cost of doing business for travel companies as well. These prices have been fluctuating since the start of 2022 and after a respite earlier this year as oil investors remained optimistic about sufficient demand for their products, the latter half of 2023 is seeing oil prices soar again. A big reason behind the high oil prices is the need for oil producing countries to balance their budgets as demand expectations from China start to wither down. The world's second largest economy in nominal terms and the biggest in purchasing power parity is dealing with a set of problems that are worrying investors.The travel industry depends on discretionary income, and recent trends indicate that consumers might start having less of this since gas prices in America have risen. To understand the impact that all these events have made, consider the story of Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE). Ever since inflation started to rise in early 2022, Expedia's shares started on a downward run. These troubles are also visible when looking at the stock of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). While the stock has still performed better than Expedia, the shares nevertheless have posted a 4.72% gain over the past five years. During the same time period, the S&amp;P 500 is up by a strong 53%, gains that outpace the return offered by major airlines such as Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) (down 29.54%) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) (down 64.82%).Story continuesThe turmoil faced by the airlines and the hospitality firms is nothing when we take a look at cruise ship operators. Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) still haven't recovered from the coronavirus-induced sell off, and are down 24.7% over the past five years. However, if you think this is bad, then you'd be glad you hadn't bought Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH) in 2020 since its stock is down by a stunning 70% over the past five years. We've covered the shock to the cruise ship industry in detail as part of our coverage of 10 Best Cruise Stocks To Buy Now so check it out if you want to see just how bad things were for the companies, their employees, and the travelers stuck on vessels.Yet, even though the travel industry is down, it doesn't mean it's dusted for. The global economy should recover at some point in time, even as China struggles to move to pre-coronavirus levels and Europe - led by Germany - struggles to find economic stability. International tourism is expected to touch 95% of pre-pandemic levels this year, and Europe is one of the regions that is leading the recovery. Data from the United Nations' World Tourism Organization (WTO) shows that while international tourism had recovered to 65% of pre pandemic levels in 2022, the European sector had recovered to 80% and Western Europe to 87%.This recovery is also affecting the ticket prices between Europe and the U.S. Combined with high fuel prices, airlines and other firms have to scale up their operations as product demand increases. This scaling costs money, which is why prices go up during periods of high demand. As to what the situation in the industry was as the second half of 2023 kicked off, here's what the management of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) had to say during the firm's second quarter of 2023 earnings call:We continue to see strong growth in Travel and Entertainment spending, which increased by double-digits in the quarter and remains strong across customer categories and geographies. Q2 was a record quarter for restaurant reservations through our Resy platform and bookings through our consumer travel business reached their highest levels since before the pandemic.. . . And look, I mean, just look at consumer, right? I mean consumer in the U.S. is up at 10%. T&amp;E is still very, very strong. We talked about travel bookings, travel bookings more than one month out are higher than they’ve been pre-pandemic. They are higher than they were at this time last year. They were higher than they were, obviously, in 2019. International is really coming back strong for us. And as we said, it’s a fastest growing part of our business. And the other thing I’ll point out is you just had — you had a little hangover of noise from Omicron in this quarter because last year, you had a little bit of spending that was pushed from the first quarter to the second quarter. And if you look at — if you go back and look sequentially last year was a huge increase sequentially quarter-over-quarter.So, with these details in mind, we decided to take a look at which travel stocks billionaires are buying. Some top stock picks are Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG).Travel Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnPhoto by Artur Voznenko on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of travel stocks being bought by billionaires, we first compiled a list of the largest companies categorized as travel services by Yahoo Finance.

There was a reduction in feedgas intake of between 200 mcf and 500 mcf on those six occasions, according to LSEG data.Four events affected Train 3 processing unit, with the most recent on Sept. 5. The other two occasions in which gas usage fell were caused by events at Train 1 unit, according to the TCEQ report.Each time there was a return to normal operations within 48 hours.The continued reduction in feedgas intake reflects operational challenges at Trains 1 and 3, said one person familiar with Freeport LNG's operations.Story continuesThe Freeport export plant in Texas was shut down after a fire in June 2022, and ended an eight-month outage in February.U.S. natural gas futures held near a one-week high on Monday on a big daily drop in U.S. output and much higher global gas prices. Capping those gains were forecasts for milder weather, lower demand over the next two weeks and the reduction in feedgas to Freeport LNG.An outage at the facility would add to market concerns over global LNG supply as workers at Chevron Corp's Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects in Australia began hours-long work stoppages on Friday, with the industrial unrest leading to a spike in European gas prices.The workers plan a total strike for two weeks from Sept. 14, while Chevron said it would ask Australia's industrial relations tribunal to intervene to halt strike action.

(NYSE:OMC) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.77bUS$1.87bUS$1.65bUS$1.75bUS$1.74bUS$1.74bUS$1.76bUS$1.78bUS$1.81bUS$1.84bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.47%Est @ 0.32%Est @ 0.87%Est @ 1.25%Est @ 1.52%Est @ 1.71% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$961US$911(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$12bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.8b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.2%) = US$37bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$37b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$18bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$30b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$78.9, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Omnicom Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.026. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Omnicom GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Media market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

In a recent announcement, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has introduced the Copilot Copyright Commitment, which extends intellectual property indemnification to commercial Copilot services. This means if a third party sues a commercial customer for copyright infringement due to the use of Microsoft's Copilots or their generated output, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) will assume responsibility for the legal risks involved. Moreover, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) acknowledges the importance of respecting authors' copyrights and retains control of their rights under copyright law. They have implemented safeguards in their Copilots to reduce the likelihood of returning infringing content. Speaking of key players in Ai, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also been achieving groundbreaking developments in the field AI, as demonstrated by their recent announcement of PaLM 2. The language model powers not only Bard but also over 25 other product features. What makes PaLM 2 remarkable is its ability to outperform its predecessor while being smaller and more cost-effective to operate. PaLM 2 offers four different model sizes which also includes a lighter version suitable for mobile devices. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s effort to improving PaLM 2 involved studying model scaling laws to optimize the combination of training compute, model size, and data size. Additionally, they improved the model's multilingual capabilities by incorporating more languages into the training dataset.

Owing to the consistency of the company with its developments and investments, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also been one of the Goldman Sach’s top ai stocks.Pershing Square Holdings made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first half 2023 investor letter:“Earlier this year, we initiated a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google. We believe that Google is one of the world’s greatest businesses with deep barriers to entry and massive network effects underpinning its core search business. After having closely followed the company for many years, we had the opportunity to acquire a stake in Google at a highly attractive valuation as misplaced concerns over its competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and its strong growth prospects.Google is the dominant leader in the fast-growing digital advertising market. Google has 85%+ market share in search and, along with YouTube, approximately 50% share of the digital advertising market. With higher and improving returns on investment, we expect digital ads to continue to take market share from traditional ad formats like TV and print, and increasingly drive the total advertising market growth above its historical trend. For example, in retail, rising e-commerce penetration is catalyzing the migration of offline promotion and trade spend dollars into digital ads. With Search and YouTube as two of the highest return and most resilient ad formats, Google is well positioned to benefit from the structural growth in digital ad share across many categories.Similarly, in its Cloud business, Google is a top three player in an oligopolistic market that is in the early stages of a multi[1]year shift of IT workloads from on-premise to cloud and hybrid cloud solutions. These powerful secular tailwinds have enabled Google to grow overall revenues at a high-teens compound annual growth rate over the last five years which should continue to support near- double-digit top-line growth in the coming years…” (Click here to read the full text) Our MethodologyTo prepare the list of best ai tools to land your dream job, we conducted an extensive research to find out the tools that have been highly active in contributing to helping out job seekers.

Both have a lot to lose.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-us-and-google-prepare-to-clash-in-monopoly-trial-both-have-a-lot-to-lose-101034818.html,1694427034,STORY,"['MSFT', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'AAPL']","[One of the most consequential antitrust trials in decades begins Tuesday as federal and state prosecutors try to prove that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) illegally stifled competition in the world of online search.A lot is on the line for both sides.The lawsuit against Google is a supreme test for the US government, which is trying to use a 133-year-old law to rein in several of the country’s most dominant tech giants. For Google, it is a threat to a core profit engine that sits at the heart of a trillion-dollar empire amassed over the last quarter century.That drama will unfold over the next nine weeks before federal district Judge Amit Mehta in the US District Court for the District of Columbia; he will decide whether Google broke the law and what any consequences might be for the company.It could also involve testimony from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other well-known tech executives.Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet. (Christoph Soeder/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)The case closely resembles the government's attempts to rein in Microsoft (MSFT) during the late 1990s, when the US alleged that the tech giant boxed out rivals by making its browser the default on its dominant Windows operating system. It resulted in a settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.That 2001 pact — which required Microsoft to design its Windows operating system to interoperate with competing browsers — created an opportunity for Google, then a startup formed by Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to begin its period of meteoric growth in the 2000s.Google founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page, right, in 2004. They started the company in 1998. (Photo: JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP via Getty Images) (JOHN MACDOUGALL via Getty Images)The government now argues Google broke the law as it became the dominant way most people searched for information on the web, abusing its power through contracts that secured its search engine as the default on computers and mobile devices.With that scale, the government claims, Google created nearly insurmountable barriers to the search market and then used that monopoly to build a lucrative advertising business. The government says the company's conduct harmed consumers by reducing the quality and choice of search services, impeding innovation, and driving up the cost of advertising.Story continuesOne key way it did this, the government alleges, was by paying various companies to make Google the default choice on their devices, including Apple’s iPhones and computers. That made it more challenging for consumers to find other search engines.Prosecutors cite an agreement between Apple (AAPL) and Google in which Apple must make Google’s search engine the default for Safari and use Google for its voice-activated assistant service Siri.In exchange for the placement, according to government prosecutors, Google pays Apple through an ad revenue-sharing agreement that nets Apple $8 billion-$12 billion. That revenue accounted for 15% to 20% of Apple’s worldwide net income the year prior to the Justice Department's suit.Google CEO Sundar Pichai, left, sits next to Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, at the White House in June. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)The government also cites similar search default agreements Google has with device manufacturers that license its Android operating system, including LG, Motorola, and Samsung, and contracts for default status with US wireless carriers AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon as well as browser developers Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox.Google's core defense is that the company does provide consumers with choices; they are able to choose different search engines by changing their default settings.The company also says it faces plenty of competition from browsers created by Microsoft and Apple that are free to choose alternate search services and notes that Apple's mobile operating system iOS, unlike Android, is a closed system that isn't licensable to other device manufacturers.Google's current dominance in search and search advertising is unquestioned. As of July 2023, Google's search engine was responsible for returning roughly 89% of all US general search engine queries across computer and mobile devices. Google was used on 95% of all US mobile device queries, according to Statista.The next largest competitors, Microsoft’s Bing and Yahoo Search (an affiliate of Yahoo Finance), hold 6.4% and 2.3% shares, respectively.Google, according to government prosecutors, also controls more than 70% of the markets for search advertising and search engine text advertising.'That Google is long gone'The case against Google began under the Trump administration with an October 2020 lawsuit focused on its alleged abuse of online search and continued under the Biden administration.""Two decades ago, Google became the darling of Silicon Valley as a scrappy start-up with an innovative way to search the emerging internet,"" the Justice Department said in its suit. ""That Google is long gone.""A group of 38 state attorneys general also filed suit that year, making similar allegations about Google’s abuse of search as well as search advertising.The state case is consolidated with the Justice Department's case and will be heard at the same time starting this week before Mehta, the federal district judge overseeing the trial. Some of the Justice Department and state claims have already been dismissed by Mehta.The Google antitrust case that begins Tuesday will be overseen by federal district judge Amit Mehta, pictured here when he was an attorney speaking before the state Supreme Court in New York. (Stan Honda/Pool Photo via AP, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Google faces other legal challenges from the US and other states. The Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general filed a separate suit in federal district court in Virginia earlier this year targeting Google’s monopoly in the market for online advertising technology that is used to sell, buy, and broker advertising space online.Another group of state attorneys general that sued Google in 2021 for alleged violations of antitrust law targeted Google's dominance in mobile app store distribution and in-app payments, via Google Play.Google and those states said Tuesday they had reached a tentative settlement in the mobile app store case and would disclose its terms next month.'A last resort, not a first resort'US prosecutors face a major hurdle in the antitrust trial that starts Tuesday: the presumption that lower, even free, prices are a consumer advantage and not necessarily anticompetitive. Consumers don't pay Google to search for information on the web.""The fact that Big Tech's effect is to offer these services for free, then it makes it harder to challenge,"" Rutgers Law School professor Michael Carrier said.However, advertisers do pay for Google's services and could be a strong focus for prosecutors. Antitrust law has evolved over the past decade, he said, to allow judges to consider multiple sides of a market.The judge could theoretically order a break up of the company, but Carrier considers that ""a last resort, not the first resort"" to remedy antitrust violations.""The agencies might have a goal of breaking up these companies, but that's hard to do,"" Carrier said.What is more likely, Carrier added, is that business practices could change if the judge sides with the government's arguments.""If you look at what's at issue in the Google trial, it's focused on these exclusive deals with browsers or OEMs, and even if Google is found to violate antitrust law that would mean an end to those deals, not a break up of Google.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

We're glad this issue is finally going to have its day in court,"" said DuckDuckGo spokesman Kamyl Bazbaz who said that Google had a ""stranglehold on major distribution points for more than a decade.""Google has denied wrongdoing and is prepared to vigorously defend itself.The legal fight has huge implications for Big Tech, which has been accused of buying or strangling small competitors but has insulated itself against many accusations of breaking antitrust law because the services the companies provide to users are free, as in the case of Alphabet's Google and Facebook, or low price, as in the case of Amazon.com.“It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this case, particularly for monopolies and companies with significant market share,” antitrust lawyer Luke Hasskamp told Reuters.“This will be a major case, particularly for the major tech companies of the world (Google, Apple, Twitter, and others), which have grown to have an outsized role in nearly all our lives,” he added.Story continuesPrevious antitrust trials of similar importance include Microsoft, filed in 1998, and AT&amp;T, filed in 1974. The AT&amp;T breakup in 1982 is credited with paving the way for the modern cell phone industry while the fight with Microsoft is credited with opening space for Google and others on the internet.Congress tried to rein in Big Tech last year but largely missed. It considered bills to check the market power of the companies, like legislation to prevent them from preferencing their own products, but failed to pass the most aggressive of them.Big Tech's rivals now pin their hope on Judge Amit Mehta, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.The lawsuit that goes to trial was brought by former President Donald Trump's Justice Department. In a rare show of bipartisan agreement, President Joe Biden's Justice Department has pressed on with the lawsuit and filed a second one against Google in January focused on advertising technology.Judge Mehta will decide if Google has broken antitrust law in this first trial, and, if so, what should be done. The government has asked the judge to order Google to stop any illegal activity but also urged ""structural relief as needed,"" raising the possibility that the tech giant could be ordered broken up.The government's strongest arguments are those against Google's revenue sharing agreements with Android makers, which requires Google to be the only search on the smartphone in exchange for a percentage of search advertising revenue, said Daniel McCuaig, a partner at Cohen Milstein who was formerly with the U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division.

(NASDAQ:WBA), tumbled following an earnings miss and subsequent reduction in full year 2023 guidance and lower preliminary 2024 outlook. Challenging consumer and macroeconomic conditions, a significant decline in demand for COVID-related products and services, and a weaker respiratory season pressured margins. In response, management raised its cost savings program target and implemented capital spend reductions to optimize profitability for its U.S. Healthcare segment. As investors remain on the sidelines, we look to WBA’s free cash flow generation and 4.8% dividend yield to cushion further downside.

Despite the possibility of more near-term uncertainty, volatility, and selling, the overall upbeat backdrop that drove much of the 2023 rally remains in place.Therefore, investors with long-term horizons might want to consider buying proven S&amp;P 500 stocks that are trading at levels that could look like steals years or even months from now. The three stocks we explore today are Starbucks, Paycom Software and Public Storage.The recent downturn in the early days of a traditionally poor month for stocks has seen the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq slide back below their 50-day moving averages. The bulls might have to hold their ground in the lead-up to the August CPI release on September 13. Yet, the nearby chart showcases how the Nasdaq is interacting with its 21-week moving average (red line) and why it might indicate more bullishness going forward.Now might be a time for investors to take a giant step back and remember to block out the constant noise and look to the two biggest drivers of stock prices: earnings and interest rates.Zacks estimates call for S&amp;P 500 earnings to soar 11.7% in 2024 and another 10.9% in 2025 vs. a projected decline of -3.2% in 2023. And Jay Powell and Co. remain near the end of their tightening cycle.Rates might have to stay higher for longer as the U.S. economy remains resilient. In fact, the higher rates signal ongoing strength and growth, which further supports the soft landing that more Wall Street giants are calling for.All told, it might be time for investors to take one of Warren Buffett’s most used mantras to heart and “be greedy when others are fearful” and start looking at large-cap S&amp;P 500 stocks that have fallen out of favor and are trading at levels that might look likes steals years from now.Story continuesStarbucks is the coffee shop powerhouse that boasts over 37,000 stores globally. The company has grown at an impressive clip for over 20 years to become one of the most valuable brands in the world. SBUX’s e-commerce, delivery, and other digital initiatives have helped it thrive in the changing retail environment, with its app one of the most downloaded food and drink apps in the world last year, behind only McDonald’s, Uber Eats and DoorDash.Starbucks topped our Q3 FY23 earnings estimates in early August, as it showcased impressive resilience amid slowing consumer spending, with global comparable sales up 10%. SBUX is improving how its stores and supply chains operate and working on expanding in smaller cities and towns.Some are worried about consumers in its two largest markets—the U.S. and China—but Zacks estimates call for it to post 11% YoY revenue growth both this year and next to help boost its adjusted earnings by around 17% each year.Starbucks, which currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has soared 1,200% over the last 20 years vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 350% and McDonald’s 1,100%. Yet, SBUX trades 25% below its peaks and 21% under its average Zacks price target.Some investors might want to wait for it to cross above some key moving averages. But coffee isn’t going out of style and neither is Starbucks. SBUX is also trading at a 36% discount its highs and 10% below its 10-year median at 23.8X forward earnings.Paycom Software was a pioneer in digital HR and payroll technology over 20 years ago. Paycom’s cloud software today helps with onboarding, benefits enrollment, talent management, and beyond. PAYC and other similar software are now deeply embedded and essential at companies big and small. And Paycom’s decade of impressive double-digit revenue growth backs up its value and vital nature.Paycom topped our Q2 earnings and sales estimates in early August and upped its guidance as it expands its total addressable market to “include larger North American organizations with both domestic and foreign employees.” Zacks estimates call for it to post 25% revenue and earnings growth this year and 21% higher sales and EPS in 2024.Paycom stock has skyrocketed since its 2014 IPO, but it is currently trading 50% below its record highs. The downturn, coupled with its earnings outlook helps its valuation look far more reasonable. Plus, PAYC earlier this year began to pay a dividend for the first time to highlight its overall financial strength.Public Storage is one of the largest self-storage companies in the country, with roughly 3,000 facilities in the U.S. and almost two million customers. PSA is a REIT that’s been gaining momentum for years as Americans continue to buy tons of stuff, big and small. The company’s revenue has soared over the last 20-plus years, including 22% growth in 2022.Zacks estimates call for PSA to post 8% revenue growth in FY23 and 6% higher sales in FY24, which would mark stronger expansion compared to the several-year stretch prior to its Covid boom. Public Storage’s adjusted FFO (which are essentially earnings for REITs) are projected to climb by roughly 5% during both years.PSA shares have climbed 600% over the last 20 years to crush the benchmark. Public Storage is still up nearly 30% in the past three years even though it is down 35% from its peaks.PSA is currently trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple since the initial Covid crash (15.5X), which puts it at decade-long lows even though the stock has climbed 75% in the past 10 year. Plus, Public Storage lifted its dividend by 50% earlier this year, with it yielding 4.5% at the moment.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

This expansion can be attributed to several factors, like the increasing global population, which is projected to reach 10 billion by 2050 and has led a to heightened food demand. Crop production, a major component of agriculture, has seen considerable growth, with global cereal production expected to increase by 13% by 2027. Agribusiness companies are also actively acquiring arable land to boost crop production and meet the rising demands. It is also worth highlighting that owing to the rising demand of labor in agriculture, farming has emerged as one of the most respected professions in the world.How Is Artificial Intelligence Transforming the Agriculture Industry?We have already established many industries are being revolutionzed by AI and automation technologies and hence, agriculture industry is no exception. It is also worth mentioning that Agricultural Robots, Predictive Analytics, and, Crop and Soil Monitoring are the three most popular applications of AI in agriculture.  Smart farming, powered by IoT technology, is revolutionizing agriculture by leveraging sensors, gateways, and data analysis to optimize crop management. These sensors capture essential data from fields, which is then stored and analyzed on cloud platforms.

Five remained hospitalized on Monday morning, ADM said.The company said it was evaluating the extent of the damage and investigating the cause of the incident.Several structures were severely damaged in the blast, including a 10-story building and adjacent buildings, the fire department said.A plant that crushes soybeans into soybean oil and white flake for soy protein production was down on Monday, ADM said. An adjacent corn processing plant was also ""temporarily down until we can safely resume operations,"" the company said.A prolonged outage at the massive processing facility in the heart of the U.S. Corn Belt would put downward pressure on crop prices just as Midwest farmers are preparing to harvest their corn and soybeans. U.S. crop prices, especially for corn, have declined as export demand has slumped.The Decatur site, ADM's North American headquarters and its largest facility globally, houses soybean crushing facilities and one of the largest corn wet mills in the world.It has the capacity to produce 375 million gallons (1.42 billion liters) of ethanol biofuel annually, making it the largest in the country, according to the Renewable Fuels Association.""Coming into harvest, if it is down for a week or more, that would really cripple the cash basis,"" said Mike Zuzolo, president of Global Commodity Analytics.Spot basis bids for corn at ADM's Decatur location tumbled by 35 cents a bushel from late bids on Friday while soybean bids were flat.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So while Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Philip Morris International is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.32 = US$12b ÷ (US$62b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 32%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 18% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International roceIn the above chart we have measured Philip Morris International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Philip Morris International.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIn terms of Philip Morris International's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 51%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Philip Morris International's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Philip Morris International's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 56% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Philip Morris International and understanding them should be part of your investment process.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ROP) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$503 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$451. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Roper Technologies' current trading price of US$492 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Roper Technologies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Roper Technologies What Is Roper Technologies Worth?According to my valuation model, Roper Technologies seems to be fairly priced at around 17% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Roper Technologies today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $593.68, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Roper Technologies’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Roper Technologies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 54% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Roper Technologies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ROP’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ROP, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Roper Technologies from their most recent forecasts.

(NYSE:GS) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 68% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-group-inc-nyse-120155588.html,1694433715,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Goldman Sachs Group's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently A look at the shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 68% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Goldman Sachs Group, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Goldman Sachs Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Goldman Sachs Group is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.5% and 5.7% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$612m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 32% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Goldman Sachs Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Goldman Sachs Group .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

To skip our detailed analysis of Chinese market dynamics today, you can go directly to see Goldman Sachs China Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.US-China RivalryChinese companies and news have managed to remain a top interest for American governments, businesses, and investors for a long time now because of the ongoing US-China tensions when it comes to competing in the global market. The US-China trade war has continued for years now, with both countries imposing tariffs and other trade restrictions on each other. For example, the US and China both imposed heavy tariffs on each other in 2018 and 2019, which some consider to be the move that kickstarted the major trade conflict between the two. Because of these heightened tensions, companies even today are having to struggle for key positions in the Chinese market, which otherwise has proven itself to be a lucrative opportunity. On September 8, Dewardric McNeal, the managing director at Longview Global, joined CNBC's 'Fast Money' to discuss this conundrum and the status of US-China market tensions today. Here's what he had to say on the matter:""The real question is: have we entered an excludatory, retaliatory, tit-for-tat cycle like we saw during the trade war. If we have, and it's possible that we have, then there are some sectors, some companies, that I think will have some challenges. I think in aviation, Boeing - I think China an alternative in their mind. They're happy to play airbus off of Boeing. They also have a domestic brand, the Comac C919, or the C929 as well, so they think they have an alternative there. Automobiles, look, Tesla, we've been talking about this for quite some time, GM, possibly, are at risk with BYD.""McNeal went on to discuss how Chinese companies seem to be posing a significant threat to American companies in select sectors today because of their progress, development, and growth in several markets, including the American and European markets. He believes that companies need to get into a ""competition mindset"" if they wish to beat Chinese competitors at this game because the Chinese ""have their own widgets"" which they want to sell in both the Chinese market and in third markets across the globe.Story continuesApple vs. HuaweiThese developments should not come as a surprise for those who have been keeping track of China's economic and trade developments over the past few years. The country is dedicated to its internal development so that it is able to become reliant on itself instead of its Western competitors, according to McLean. China is also proving its worth in the tech space, particularly with the battle between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei, since the latter's release of a 5G smartphone that some think can rival the big tech giant's iPhone in performance while also being significantly cheaper. Here's what McLean said on this front:""This Mate 60 is, I think, an impressive phone. I think it surprised Washington for sure, but it's seven nanometers. Apple, in a couple of days here, will debut their 15 pro. That's a three nanometer chip. So, you know, there's still a lot of room here between seven nanometers and three nanometers. But the Chinese are very comfortable that they don't have to be the best, they just have to be good enough to dominate their market.""Considering the China expert's take on this matter, it becomes evident that while the US may still be considered to be in the lead, China is catching up fast. Even if it doesn't catch up, its goal at this point is merely to establish market dominance by providing alternatives to American products that are either better in performance or in pricing.

The fully digital platform allows purchasers to transact tokenized carbon credits directly with project developers and retire these against their carbon footprint.Pete Cherecwich, president of Asset Servicing at Northern Trust, said: ""This new development from Northern Trust’s Digital Assets and Financial Markets team represents a significant milestone toward delivering a market-leading platform able to support a diverse range of digital assets. Allowing institutional clients to access carbon credits and doing our part to help these firms along their carbon offsetting journey is important for the future.""Justin Chapman, global head of Digital Assets and Financial Markets, at Northern Trust, said: ""The use of digital technology to manage the lifecycle of carbon credits gives both the buyer and project developers confidence and transparency through the lifecycle of their voluntary carbon credit transactions.""Ciaran Kelly, chief executive officer at Go Balance Limited, said: ""Northern Trust’s approach to digitizing the voluntary carbon credit market has the potential to enable project developers such as Go Balance Limited to enhance our focus on initiatives to avoid deforestation by streamlining time consuming administration tasks. The solution will make it easier for all participants to track, manage and transact the registry of carbon credits, whilst also delivering full transparency to the end-to-end lifecycle of a voluntary carbon credit.""Story continuesProject developers transact with buyers of voluntary carbon credits via an online platform. Legal agreements are generated using smart contracts via the Avvoka legal contract tool with the agreement outputs creating the basis of the transaction, driving full straight-through transfer and settlement of the digital credits for fiat currency on the specified settlement date.Northern Trust has been working with a number of diverse project developers on its MVP including: Go Balance Limited, a REDD+ project developer that supports the Trocano Araretama REDD+ Project in the Municipality of Borba in Brazil; ReGen III, a clean-tech firm recycling used motor oil into high-grade group III synthetic lubricants, which is developing a Texas recycling facility that aims to prevent the release of 900,000 metric tonnes of CO2e per year from entering the atmosphere; and a direct air capture company.Transactions were initiated with these project developers on the MVP in a fully automated way by the following purchasers: MyCarbon, a UK based Carbon Consultancy firm; White Star Capital, a global multi-stage technology investment firm; and Northern Trust.Further development of the platform, including the first official live transaction, is planned in late 2023.The project is part of Northern Trust’s Digital Assets and Financial Markets group which combines the teams responsible for supporting the fast-growing digital asset markets and those dedicated to providing market access and insights across the traditional securities services markets.Northern Trust Asset Servicing has been a leading innovator in the digital transformation of securities servicing, including pioneering the use of blockchain technology in private equity fund administration in 2017, supporting the tokenization and fractionalization of bonds in 2020 and partnering in the launch of institutional-grade crypto asset custodian Zodia Custody in 2021.About Northern TrustNorthern Trust Corporation (Nasdaq: NTRS) is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking to corporations, institutions, affluent families and individuals.

Leading global financial franchise Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS), sharply declined in the quarter. Consistent with broader trends in the banking sector, NTRS clients exhibited meaningful cash sorting behavior as they withdrew funds in search of higher deposit yields. This resulted in lower than anticipated wealth management fees, partially offset by increased costs for short-term funding as well as deposits. While net interest margin and net interest income will likely remain under pressure near-term, we believe NTRS remains well positioned. The company is a trusted name in a favorable industry with a diversified product offering and high barriers to entry.

It has amassed assets over $519.50 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap ValueMid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.06%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.40%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk.

Industrials and Utilities round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, American International Group Inc (AIG) accounts for about 1.04% of total assets, followed by Paccar Inc (PCAR) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 9.62% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskIMCV seeks to match the performance of the MORNINGSTAR US MID CAP BROAD VALUE INDEX before fees and expenses.

(NYSE:AIG) Passed Our Checks, And It's About To Pay A US$0.36 Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-group-inc-nyse-123212629.html,1694349132,STORY,['AIG'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) is about to go ex-dividend in just three days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase American International Group's shares before the 14th of September to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.36 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.44 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, American International Group has a trailing yield of approximately 2.4% on its current stock price of $59.66. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for American International Group Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. American International Group is paying out just 20% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see American International Group's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 53% per annum for the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. American International Group has delivered an average of 14% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid American International Group? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. American International Group ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.So while American International Group looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for American International Group you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

54,0707280a-a4e9-39d8-8462-975a73e043a8,AMGN,2023-09-11,AMGEN PRESENTS NEW LUMAKRAS® (SOTORASIB) PLUS CHEMOTHERAPY DATA IN FIRST-LINE KRAS G12C NSCLC AT WCLC,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-presents-lumakras-sotorasib-plus-130000423.html,1694350800,STORY,['AMGN'],"[In Phase 1b Study, Patients Treated in First-Line Demonstrated a Confirmed Objective Response Rate of 65%THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Sept. 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced exciting data from a study arm of the CodeBreaK 101 clinical trial, a Phase 1b study evaluating LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) with carboplatin and pemetrexed in adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These results were featured in an oral presentation at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2023 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in Singapore on Sunday, September 10.In patients treated in the first-line setting (n=20), the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 65%, with a 100% disease control rate (DCR) (95% CI: 83.2, 100). In assessable patients in the second-line setting (n=13), the ORR was 54%, with a DCR of 85% (95% CI: 54.6, 98.1). Among patients with protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression less than 1%, the ORR was 62% in the first-line setting and 50% in the second-line setting. With a median follow-up of 3.0 months, preliminary rapid and durable responses were observed. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were immature.""We are delighted to see the positive data from the global CodeBreaK 101 trial further validate our approach to move LUMAKRAS earlier within the treatment paradigm through novel therapeutic combinations,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Notably, these results follow and further expand upon the Phase 2 investigator-led data demonstrating favorable efficacy and safety of LUMAKRAS plus carboplatin and pemetrexed in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC.""The LUMAKRAS plus chemotherapy combination reported treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) consistent with LUMAKRAS and other platinum doublet-based approaches. The most common TRAEs were neutropenia/neutrophil count decrease (53%), anemia (39%) and thrombocytopenia/platelet count decrease (37%). No fatal adverse events occurred.Story continues""Combination treatment is an important approach to prevent or delay the onset of drug resistance and improve the depth and durability of targeted response in KRAS G12C­­-mutated NSCLC,"" said Jeffrey M. Clarke, M.D., oncologist and associate professor of medicine, Duke Cancer Institute at Duke University. ""The CodeBreaK 101 results show exciting efficacy with sotorasib plus chemotherapy and, importantly for a combination treatment, a safety profile consistent with the individual therapies. These data warrant continued investigation in larger trials.""Based on these results, Amgen has initiated a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS plus carboplatin and pemetrexed in first-line KRAS G12C-mutant and negative for programmed cell death PD-L1 advanced NSCLC (CodeBreaK 202; NCT05920356), with enrollment expected to start before the end of 2023.About CodeBreaK 101CodeBreaK 101 (NCT04185883) is a global Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of sotorasib in combination with other anticancer therapies in patients with advanced solid tumors and the KRAS G12C mutation. Subprotocol F of the Phase 1b trial is assessing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of sotorasib in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed with or without pembrolizumab maintenance, with docetaxel, or with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC.1About LUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS® (sotorasib)Amgen took on one of the toughest challenges of the last 40 years in cancer research by developing LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, a KRASG12C inhibitor.2 LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile with rapid, deep, and durable anticancer activity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the KRAS G12C mutation with a once daily oral formulation.3Amgen is progressing the largest and broadest global KRASG12C inhibitor development program with unparalleled speed and exploring more than 10 sotorasib combination regimens, with clinical trial sites spanning five continents. To date, over 6,500 patients around the world have received LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS through the clinical development program and commercial use.In May 2021, LUMAKRAS was the first KRASG12C inhibitor to receive regulatory approval with its approval in the U.S., under accelerated approval. LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS is also approved in the European Union, Japan, United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, Thailand, Qatar, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Great Britain, Kuwait, Macao, Singapore, Mexico, Israel, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Russia. Additionally, Amgen has submitted MAAs in Colombia, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS is also being studied in multiple other solid tumors.4About Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and the KRAS G12C MutationLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and it accounts for more deaths worldwide than colon cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.5 Overall survival rates for NSCLC are improving but remain poor for patients with advanced disease, and 5-year survival is only 9% for those with metastatic disease.6KRAS G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC.7 About 13% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.8 Unmet medical need remains high and treatment options are limited for NSCLC patients with the KRAS G12C mutation whose first-line treatment has failed to work or has stopped working. The outcomes with other approved therapies are suboptimal, with a median progression-free survival of approximately four months following second-line treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC.9LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) U.S. IndicationLUMAKRAS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) Important U.S. Safety Information Hepatotoxicity LUMAKRAS can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis.Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.7% (all grades) and 1.4% (Grade 3). A total of 18% of patients who received LUMAKRAS had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST); 6% were Grade 3 and 0.6% were Grade 4. In addition to dose interruption or reduction, 5% of patients received corticosteroids for the treatment of hepatotoxicity.Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior to the start of LUMAKRAS every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations.Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS based on severity of adverse reaction.Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis LUMAKRAS can cause ILD/pneumonitis that can be fatal. Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.8% of patients, all cases were Grade 3 or 4 at onset, and 1 case was fatal. LUMAKRAS was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients.Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold LUMAKRAS in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 20% were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity and cough.Drug Interactions Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant medications, including prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, dietary and herbal products.Inform patients to avoid proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists while taking LUMAKRAS.If coadministration with an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, inform patients to take LUMAKRAS 4 hours before or 10 hours after a locally acting antacid.Please see LUMAKRAS full Prescribing Information.

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected.  We may not obtain regulatory clearance to acquire Horizon or be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such acquisition or integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative.

If you want to skip our discussion on the mining industry, head directly to 5 Best Mining ETFs.Mining and metals operations are long-term investments. In today's fast-changing environment, companies need to look ahead for sustainable growth. As highlighted by Deloitte, while many mining firms have general ESG goals, specific nature-related targets are rare. Often, ESG is treated separately from core business functions. For example, processes like site selection and mine planning continue as usual. However, nature's impact is expected to affect mining companies directly or through supply chains in the next decade. This impact can create or destroy value in different scenarios. Reflecting these impacts in strategies and valuations is crucial. Developing skills and understanding will help companies protect against threats and make the most of opportunities. Moving forward, mining firms with an integrated approach to nature within their ESG strategy will have an advantage in funding, insurance, talent attraction, and securing permits and social approval.According to KPMG, with the global economy transitioning toward a carbon-free future, a significant concern is whether mining and metals companies possess the capability to supply the increasing quantities of materials required for products like wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. These materials are essential for facilitating the shift to a net-zero world. The mining and metals industry, as per a global survey conducted by KPMG International, involving over 400 C-level executives representing diversified mining and metal production activities, ranging from steel to coal to lithium, appears to hold a strong belief in its capacity to meet these increasing demand projections. Optimistic viewpoints outnumbered pessimistic ones by nearly 12 to 1 in the survey results. However, among producers of materials critical to achieving a net-zero future, such as lithium and copper, the ratio slightly decreases to 6 to 1 in favor of optimism. KPMG International interviewed Rohitesh Dhawan, who serves as the President and CEO of the International Council on Mining &amp; Metals, an organization representing a significant portion of the global industry. Dhawan, in his role as a representative of the industry, understands its crucial role in a range of issues during this pivotal period in history. He said:Story continues“We’re entering a new phase that we’ve never had before. The world is now fully invested in our industry in a way it was not previously. This means that the things that got us here aren’t the things that will take us to the next phase in our relationship with society. It requires us to engage differently.”As per PwC’s findings, mining revenue remained stable at $711 billion in 2022, marking another year of strong financial performance. However, rising costs and economic uncertainties led to a decrease in EBITDA margins from 32% to 29%. According to PwC, the market capitalization of the Top 40 miners tripled from $400 billion in 2003 to $1.2 trillion in 2022. The energy transition's impact is expected to shape the industry for the next couple of decades. Miners will need to navigate the growing influence of governments and new entrants like automobile companies in the sector, while also positioning themselves well for the clean energy shift that relies on resource access. The focus on critical minerals dominated deal activities in 2022 as miners sought to take advantage of the global shift towards clean energy, driven by two key factors; firstly, these minerals' pivotal role in clean energy technologies like batteries, electric vehicles, and solar and wind power; and secondly, their significance in national defense, technologies, and weaponry. Exploration in gold, copper, lithium, and cobalt saw notable growth in 2022. Given the growing demand and limited supply of critical minerals, continued investment in exploration for these minerals is essential for driving the energy transition. Andries Rossouw, PwC Africa Mining Leader, stated:“Looking forward, the next 20 years has the potential to be as positive for the industry as the last 20 years. Demand for critical minerals—which fuels a growing boom in sustainability requirements like electric vehicles—requires miners to reinvent and reimagine how they will best support their clients and stakeholders globally. The high-demand era of critical minerals is now. It’s full of opportunity; but for those miners who do not reimagine and reinvent their operations by finding the right value-chain partners, they will likely miss out on the opportunity.”In this article, we explore some of the best mining ETFs, which provide investors with access to companies like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM), and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ). Our MethodologyWe used an ETF screener and filtered out the best performing mining ETFs based on their 5-year performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. These ETFs have amassed significant gains in the past 5 years. The list is ranked in ascending order of the 5-year performance of these mining ETFs as of September 9, 2023.10 Best Mining ETFsPixabay/Public DomainBest Mining ETFs10. Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE:GOEX)5-Year Performance as of September 9: 27.18%The Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE:GOEX), which is one of the best mining ETFs, aims to reflect the price and yield performance of the Solactive Global Gold Explorers &amp; Developers Total Return Index, prior to accounting for fees and expenses. This ETF grants investors access to a range of companies engaged in exploring gold deposits. It was introduced on November 3, 2010. As of September 8, 2023, the ETF's total assets stand at $34.52 million, with an expense ratio of 0.65%. Its portfolio consists of 51 stocks.Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) is one of the top holdings of the Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE:GOEX). Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) offers precious and base metal properties in the United States and globally. The company engages in the extraction of silver, gold, lead, and zinc concentrates. It also handles carbon material containing silver and gold, which it sells to custom smelters, metal traders, and third-party processors. Additionally, the company deals in doré, a substance containing silver and gold.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 18 hedge funds were bullish on Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL), compared to 17 funds in the prior quarter. Eric Sprott’s Sprott Asset Management held the largest position in the company, with 2.63 million shares valued at $13.56 million.9. iShares MSCI Global Metals &amp; Mining Producers ETF (BATS:PICK)5-Year Performance as of September 9: 29.46%The iShares MSCI Global Metals &amp; Mining Producers ETF (BATS:PICK) aims to replicate the performance of the MSCI ACWI Select Metals &amp; Mining Producers Ex Gold &amp; Silver Investable Market Index. This index tracks global companies primarily engaged in mining, extraction, and production of various metals, excluding gold and silver. Launched on January 31, 2012, the ETF holds approximately $1.43 billion in net assets, with a portfolio containing 267 stocks as of September 9, 2023. The expense ratio is 0.39%.BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is the largest holding of the iShares MSCI Global Metals &amp; Mining Producers ETF (BATS:PICK). BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) functions as a resource company with operations spread worldwide. The company's activities are divided into Copper, Iron Ore, and Coal segments. Its operations include mining copper, silver, zinc, molybdenum, uranium, gold, iron ore, as well as metallurgical and energy coal.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 23 hedge funds were long BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), compared to 24 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 1.8 million shares worth $105.94 million.Like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM), and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ), BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) is one of the best mining stocks to buy.Here is what Harding Loevner has to say about BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“Our purchase of Australian mining company BHP is an example of a quality company at a moderate valuation that should deliver attractive long-term returns. We believe the market has undervalued its enduring competitive advantage due to its low cost iron and copper mining operations which has allowed the company to deliver consistent profits and cash flows across the inevitable ups and downs of the global metals cycle. While the variability of commodity prices prevents BHP from scoring in the top ranks of measured quality, we are willing to bear some of that uncertainty in return for a more attractive valuation given the company’s strong business fundamentals.”8.

The gold royalty company generates very impressive profits even if the gold price never rises, and it earns those profits year after year. Here is a long-term chart of Franco Nevada Corp., the premier gold royalty company vs. gold itself: a comparable gold price today than a decade ago, yet Franco Nevada returned 12.5% annually, matching the S&amp;P 500 return, despite its nearsole source of revenues unchanged.

If you want to skip our introduction to dividends and the general economic climate, then check out S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Top 5 Stocks Sorted By Analyst Ratings. Dividends are one of the most stable ways that you can make money from the stock market. While most attention is often focused on stock share price appreciations and the potential to cash in at the right time, dividends mostly stay in the background. However, they provide investors the option to earn bond like payments for their stock ownership. Dividends are generally paid by larger and established companies with budgets that are capable of supporting investing in growth or by others that are structured to pay out most of their earnings from investment or other entities as dividends.Since there are thousands of stocks on the market, picking out only those that have consistently paid dividends for decades despite the prevailing economic environment is quite difficult. This becomes ever more important given the current economic environment. Inflation and the stock market have roiled decision making and created a tough environment for those that seek stability. Meteoric gains made by the big technology and mega-cap firms almost seemed to reverse and start a downward trend in August, and economists and analysts as a whole are now starting to favor a cautious approach towards the stock market. The simple reason behind this is that the rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to curtail historic inflation are historic themselves. The bank rate in the U.S. is now at a two decade high, and the fact that the economy has managed to weather the storm so far has surprised a lot of professionals.Dividends can prove to be crucial if they can provide stable income in a tough environment. At the same time, reinvesting dividends into the stock that pays it (after consulting certified professionals) can also enable one to grow wealth over the decades and have a nice nest egg waiting for retirement. There are multiple lists that track dividend companies, and one of the more popular ones is the S&amp;P500 Dividend Aristocrats. The list sets a rather high bar for entry, since not only does it include only those stocks that are part of the S&amp;P 500 index, but further narrows down the selection criteria to include only those firms that have grown their dividends consecutively for the past 25 years. The total returns of these stocks are naturally higher than the S&amp;P500, and except for some rare exceptions, lead and lag the index during periods of upturns and downturns, respectively.Story continuesNearly half of the S&amp;P500 Dividend Aristocrats are firms operating in the consumer staples and industrial sectors.

Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NextEra Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.NextEra Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NextEra Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NextEra Energy. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.7% of shares outstanding. With 7.5% and 5.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of NextEra Energy, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$235m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in NextEra Energy. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for NextEra Energy (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If it’s something that is swimming against the tide of society, it’s for the society to rise up and change the law and then we can move on this.” He added that MasterCard was “very strong” on privacy.Such an approach will serve Haythornthwaite, 66, well in his new job as chairman of NatWest Group after the bank was plunged into a crisis over the botched closure of Nigel Farage’s accounts.The row over his debanking began in June after Coutts, which is owned by NatWest, said it would close the former Brexit campaigner’s account with little notice. It was later revealed that the private bank shut Farage’s accounts because his views did not align with the bank’s “values” and were at odds with its “position as an inclusive organisation”.Dame Alison Rose, NatWest’s chief executive, was then forced to resign in July after admitting to being the source of an inaccurate BBC story that Farage’s Coutts account had been closed for commercial reasons.NatWest boss Dame Alison Rose was forced to resign after admitting to being the source of an inaccurate BBC story about Nigel Farage - Nicholas.T.Ansell/PALast week, Haythornthwaite, a City veteran with the sobriquet “Slick Rick”, was picked to steer the 40pc taxpayer-owned bank out of its current storm and into calmer waters. He will join the board in early January before succeeding Sir Howard Davies as chairman next April.The task will not be straightforward. In his first few months in the job, the Oxford-educated Brit must oversee the appointment of Dame Alison’s permanent successor as chief executive. He will also need to quickly mend relations between the bank and the Government – its largest shareholder – after ministers were left furious by the Farage debanking scandal.Story continuesGary Greenwood, a banking analyst at Shore Capital, says: “[Haythornthwaite]’s biggest job will be finding a suitable new CEO.“After that, it is about trying to keep all stakeholders happy, which is not an easy task when NatWest is in the spotlight even more than most banks due to it still having around 40pc government ownership.”His appointment has been approved by both the Treasury and the City watchdog, with the former confident that Haythornthwaite will be able to steady the ship at NatWest.Haythornthwaite, who studied at both Queen’s College, Oxford and MIT, spent most of his career at BP, rising up the ranks to manage the largest oilfield in the North Sea, Magnus.He went on to run a series of businesses ranging from cement to engineering before running the boards of some of Britain’s most high-profile businesses, including British Gas-owner Centrica, Ocado and Network Rail.A government source says: “Rick has over two decades of experience leading some of the biggest commercial companies and is a widely respected choice to chair one of the UK’s largest banks.”While he has a wealth of experience, his tenures have not always been straightforward. He was accused by union bosses of presiding over a “gravy train” at Network Rail after approving a £2.4m bonus pot for directors in 2010.It came despite then transport secretary Philip Hammond urging Haythornthwaite to show “restraint” on bonuses. Hammond had written a letter to the then Network Rail chair urging him to “display a sensitivity to the wider economic climate”.Haythornthwaite has run the boards of some of Britain’s most high-profile businesses, including Centrica, Ocado and Network Rail - DANIEL JONESHaythornthwaite also faced a backlash over pay at Centrica and was criticised by a prominent shareholder advisory group for holding too many board positions at once.Some in the City were surprised that NatWest did not pick someone with banking experience. While Haythornthwaite holds an advisory position at investment bank Moelis, he has never worked at a high street lender.Greenwood says: “I’m a bit surprised they have not gone for someone with more banking experience.“That said, it’s hard to find candidates that aren’t tarnished by the past, so perhaps having an experienced non-banker has its attractions.”Besides recovering from the debanking scandal, other issues the City veteran will have to contend with include: the declining use of cash, with NatWest coming under fire in recent months after imposing new limits on cash deposits and withdrawals; branch closures; and helping to manage the Government’s sale of its remaining stake in the bank.Under current plans, the Treasury intends to offload its 38.8pc holding in NatWest by the end of 2026.In an interview with consulting giant McKinsey in 2020, NatWest’s incoming chairman outlined what boards want from their executives during times of crisis.Haythornthwaite said: “Boards need CEOs who can handle multiple truths, who can be expansive in thinking, and who can live comfortably in the future and bring the company along for the ride.”He added that “boards still want to sleep… we like to sleep soundly at night”. After a restless few months, sentiments like this will be warmly welcomed by NatWest’s directors.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Previous trends in Apple stock may shed some light on the future of the company's performance. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre provides insights into Apple’s trading history in September.Video Transcript- And we've been talking a lot about Apple shares. They've been under pressure this week on reports that Chinese officials are asking government employees to stop using iPhones. Though Wall Street analysts are skeptical of the ban's long-term impact, 66% still have a buy rating on the stock.Wedbush's Dan Ives calling China concerns way overdone. But if history is to be believed, Apple's stock may have further to fall. And it's got nothing to do with China's rumored ban. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre, he's with us. He has been looking at the technicals. And what they show is pretty fascinating.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, it is. First of all, Apple, it's no surprise they're caught in a two-- actually, a three-day, I would say, loss here, even though we're up slightly today taking away some of those losses from the prior two days. Let's just take a look at what's happened this week.And then I'm gonna get into why September is the worst month to be invested in Apple. But first, here you can see down 5%. That's worth about $180, $190 billion, give or take $10 billion. So that means a lot. And let's just take a look at the three-month chart because a shot off the bow was this drop in here.If I put some candlesticks in, you can see this was one-day drop there. And this was a record high only a few days before. And as I was researching this, I found at the time that that speed, the speed of the drop there from a record high, never been done before. And when it does happen this way, for instance, when we fall from grace and get oversold pretty quickly, Apple stock does not recover quickly.Now, a separate technical study here. I went back to the beginning of Apple stock returns. They began the IPO in 1980. And so the first full year is 1981. I took the average from 1981 to 2022 each month of the year. And here's what it would look like if you were invested only for that one month. I have August through December here. August, the second best month there, second only to October. So October right around the corner.Story continuesWell, let me tell you something. September is the absolute worst month if you had $1,000 back in 1981 and you invested that only in the month of September, guess what. It would be worth now $80. So that's a loss of about 90%.Also, August is supposed to be a bumper month yet that did not materialize. So here's another way of looking at this, Apple stock returns by month. But this is a bar graph. We can see if you were invested in September, like I said, you'd be down 92%, August, up 637%, October, 750%.But why do I believe that may not be around the corner here this October? And that's because of the situation with Apple's declining revenues. And that is something that Sanford Bernstein has been talking about recently. And I think there's some merit to it. They're comparing apples performance from 2015 to what IBM did back in the day from 1997 to 2012.And this corresponds to this stock run up that you're seeing right here in IBM stock. What happened after that? Well, they had about 20 quarters of declining revenue. And the stock price took a hit. And over the last five years, it's not a disaster. But you can see it is just trading sideways here. So Apple, if it's gonna fall from grace, I don't think it's going away. But it might just become a slightly more boring company. We'll have to see.]"

(Carlos Barria/REUTERS) (Carlos Barria / reuters)For modem chips, which facilitate wireless connectivity, Apple theoretically has the in-house tech — the company bought Intel's (INTC) modem chip business in 2019. But clearly that in-house technology isn't yet ready for prime time.It's also a reversal from earlier this year when Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said he was expecting Apple to make its own modems for 2024.Apple has been very clear about its desire to replace its own suppliers with itself. In 2020, Apple famously nixed a 15-year partnership with Intel, citing plans to build its Macs with its own chips. Since then, a whole range of Macs have come out with Apple's own chips.However, smartphones have been another story, and the supply chain is a bit more complicated, as iPhones still run on Arm-based chips. Though Apple designs those chips for iPhones in-house, it licenses the underlying structure from Arm.It's been estimated that Apple could save billions by taking control of its chips.Apple and Qualcomm have a spotty history of their own, including a yearslong legal tussle over licensing terms.

The company is the leading designer of modem chips that connect phones to mobile data networks. Apple shares rose 0.5%.San Diego, California-based Qualcomm previously signed a chip supply deal with Apple in 2019, after the two companies settled a protracted legal battle.That supply agreement ends this year, meaning that the iPhones that Apple is expected to announce on Tuesday would be the last phone debut under that deal.Under the accord announced Monday, Qualcomm said it will supply Apple with chips for phones that will come out each year until 2026. Qualcomm did not disclose the value of the deal, saying only that the terms are ""similar"" to its previous agreement.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a research note on Aug. 3, UBS analysts estimated that Qualcomm sold $7.26 billion of chips to Apple in 2022.Qualcomm also said a patent licensing deal it signed with Apple in 2019 remains in place. That deal expires in 2025, but the companies have an option to extend it for two years.""At a time when Apple is running into increasing challenges in China, reinforcing its supply chains elsewhere is a priority, and it appears the company is rolling back or at least delaying plans to go at it alone in more areas with its own chip production,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.Apple is working on its own modem technology and spent $1 billion to buy Intel's modem unit in 2019. Apple has not said how quickly it plans to ramp up the use of its own chips.Story continuesQualcomm said on Monday its financial projections will assume that only a fifth of Apple's iPhones will use its chips by 2026.However, Qualcomm made a similar projection about its business with Apple in 2021 that turned out to be overly conservative, with iPhone 14 models released last year all using Qualcomm modems.And last year, Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala updated his predictions for the 2023 iPhones that will be released this week, saying he expected the ""vast majority"" of them to include Qualcomm modems.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Miral Fahmy, David Holmes and Richard Chang)]"

If you want to skip our analysis of the recent events in the travel industry, then take a look at 5 Travel Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. The travel industry has seen disruption in one form or the other over the past four years, and a tough economic environment after the coronavirus pandemic has hampered recovery. Some sectors, such as airlines that were forced to fly routes just to keep them running and cruise companies that saw ships stranded at ports, faced crises that perhaps few would believe were possible before they happened.Like the broader economy, such as industrial production and logistics, the global benchmark crude oil prices determine the ease of the cost of doing business for travel companies as well. These prices have been fluctuating since the start of 2022 and after a respite earlier this year as oil investors remained optimistic about sufficient demand for their products, the latter half of 2023 is seeing oil prices soar again. A big reason behind the high oil prices is the need for oil producing countries to balance their budgets as demand expectations from China start to wither down. The world's second largest economy in nominal terms and the biggest in purchasing power parity is dealing with a set of problems that are worrying investors.The travel industry depends on discretionary income, and recent trends indicate that consumers might start having less of this since gas prices in America have risen. To understand the impact that all these events have made, consider the story of Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE). Ever since inflation started to rise in early 2022, Expedia's shares started on a downward run. These troubles are also visible when looking at the stock of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). While the stock has still performed better than Expedia, the shares nevertheless have posted a 4.72% gain over the past five years. During the same time period, the S&amp;P 500 is up by a strong 53%, gains that outpace the return offered by major airlines such as Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) (down 29.54%) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) (down 64.82%).Story continuesThe turmoil faced by the airlines and the hospitality firms is nothing when we take a look at cruise ship operators. Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) still haven't recovered from the coronavirus-induced sell off, and are down 24.7% over the past five years. However, if you think this is bad, then you'd be glad you hadn't bought Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH) in 2020 since its stock is down by a stunning 70% over the past five years. We've covered the shock to the cruise ship industry in detail as part of our coverage of 10 Best Cruise Stocks To Buy Now so check it out if you want to see just how bad things were for the companies, their employees, and the travelers stuck on vessels.Yet, even though the travel industry is down, it doesn't mean it's dusted for. The global economy should recover at some point in time, even as China struggles to move to pre-coronavirus levels and Europe - led by Germany - struggles to find economic stability. International tourism is expected to touch 95% of pre-pandemic levels this year, and Europe is one of the regions that is leading the recovery. Data from the United Nations' World Tourism Organization (WTO) shows that while international tourism had recovered to 65% of pre pandemic levels in 2022, the European sector had recovered to 80% and Western Europe to 87%.This recovery is also affecting the ticket prices between Europe and the U.S. Combined with high fuel prices, airlines and other firms have to scale up their operations as product demand increases. This scaling costs money, which is why prices go up during periods of high demand. As to what the situation in the industry was as the second half of 2023 kicked off, here's what the management of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) had to say during the firm's second quarter of 2023 earnings call:We continue to see strong growth in Travel and Entertainment spending, which increased by double-digits in the quarter and remains strong across customer categories and geographies. Q2 was a record quarter for restaurant reservations through our Resy platform and bookings through our consumer travel business reached their highest levels since before the pandemic.. . . And look, I mean, just look at consumer, right? I mean consumer in the U.S. is up at 10%. T&amp;E is still very, very strong. We talked about travel bookings, travel bookings more than one month out are higher than they’ve been pre-pandemic. They are higher than they were at this time last year. They were higher than they were, obviously, in 2019. International is really coming back strong for us. And as we said, it’s a fastest growing part of our business. And the other thing I’ll point out is you just had — you had a little hangover of noise from Omicron in this quarter because last year, you had a little bit of spending that was pushed from the first quarter to the second quarter. And if you look at — if you go back and look sequentially last year was a huge increase sequentially quarter-over-quarter.So, with these details in mind, we decided to take a look at which travel stocks billionaires are buying. Some top stock picks are Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG).Travel Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnPhoto by Artur Voznenko on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of travel stocks being bought by billionaires, we first compiled a list of the largest companies categorized as travel services by Yahoo Finance.

To skip our analysis of global biodiversity, its ecological and economic impacts, as well as some companies that operate within this space, go ahead and see the 5 Most Biodiverse Countries in the World.Biodiversity, or biological diversity, refers to the variety of life on Earth, including the diversity of species, genes, and ecosystems. It encompasses all living organisms, from the smallest microorganisms to the largest mammals, and the interactions they have with each other and their environments. The term biodiversity is often considered a measure of the health and resilience of ecosystems, and its loss can have far-reaching ecological, economic, and societal consequences. Although sustainability commitments are increasingly prevalent in corporate strategic planning, there remains a significant gap in attention to the critical investment required for the preservation and augmentation of global biodiversity.As per the World Economic Forum (WEF), over 50% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) relies significantly or to a moderate extent on ecosystem services. These services encompass natural resources, groundwater, and the essential role of pollination in food production. However, biodiversity investment goes beyond sustainability; it also presents a compelling business proposition. In the coming decade, the WEF projects that safeguarding natural ecosystems and enhancing biodiversity could unlock business prospects valued at a staggering $10 trillion yearly while concurrently spawning approximately 400 million fresh employment opportunities. These opportunities span various sectors, including enhancing energy efficiency in construction and implementing circular economy solutions within the automotive, electronics, and textile industries.See also: 25 Most Environmentally Friendly Companies in the WorldThus, declining ecosystems hold massive financial repercussions for companies. Similar to the asset-price bubble of 2008, this phenomenon eludes straightforward linear understanding. However, once set in motion, its consequences can far surpass the ordinary. Such a scenario holds substantial significance for businesses, affecting them in both the immediate and long-term contexts. As an illustration, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a body associated with the United Nations, has calculated that the economic worth of food production directly reliant on pollinating insects ranges from $235 billion to $577 billion on a global scale. Additionally, the UNDP states that degrading ecosystem could trigger a downward spiral of approximately $2.7 trillion in global GDP by 2030.Story continuesBusinesses perceived as environmentally conscious often cultivate an image of responsibility, yielding advantages in both public perception and practicality that extend beyond their immediate operations. Nevertheless, prioritizing cost savings through reduced energy consumption takes precedence. In addition to curbing energy use, these forward-thinking organizations allocate resources to R&amp;D, and actively champion social initiatives aimed at fostering eco-friendly products and internal procedures. For instance, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has adhered to a comprehensive ten-point environmental policy over an extended period. The corporation incorporates sustainable fabrics into its vehicles, with an impressive 80% recyclability rate for both the Focus and Escape models. Furthermore, Ford boasts ownership of one of the world's largest green roof. Aside from Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have several initiatives that are aimed at marking a positive impact on global biodiversity, either by reducing emissions and cutting back on toxic substances used in manufacturing products.25 Most Biodiverse Countries in the Worldvovan/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 25 most biodiverse countries in the world, we made use of the Global Biodiversity Index presented by social research firm 'The Swiftest' which ranks 201 countries based on six ranking factors including the number of bird, amphibian, fish, mammal, reptile, and plant species present in each nation.Most Biodiverse Countries in the World25. PanamaGlobal Biodiversity Index: 170.54 Panama boasts one of the world's greatest levels of natural diversity. Its tropical climate, characterized by elevated temperatures and humidity, provides a nurturing environment for a plethora of plant and animal species. In total, Panama is home to more than 10,462 distinct plant species, encompassing a rich assortment of 1,200 orchid varieties, 678 fern species, and 1,500 tree varieties. Additionally, the country boasts 252 mammal species, 972 native bird species, and 228 diverse amphibian species.24. CameroonGlobal Biodiversity Index: 172.41Cameroon is home to approximately 9,000 recognized plant species, and new ones are continuously being discovered by scientists each year. Among these, just over 500 species are exclusive to Cameroon, meaning they exist nowhere else on Earth. This remarkable biodiversity is a result of the diverse range of ecosystems found within the country, encompassing a coastline, savannas, deserts, mountains, and tropical rainforests. Cameroon is often aptly described as a 'miniature Africa' due to this remarkable variety of environments it harbors.23. KenyaGlobal Biodiversity Index: 179.42Kenya boasts an extensive range of ecological zones and habitats, encompassing lowland and mountain forests, both wooded and open grasslands, semi-arid scrubland, dry woodlands, inland aquatic environments, and coastal and marine ecosystems. Wetlands play a crucial role in Kenya's economy, contributing significantly to agriculture, livestock production, energy generation (via hydroelectric projects), fisheries, and tourism. Despite robust efforts to safeguard Kenya's biodiversity, there are numerous unprotected regions facing rapid degradation due to various threats, resulting in a multitude of conservation challenges.22. PhilippinesGlobal Biodiversity Index: 186.92The Philippines is renowned as a mega-diversity country with regards to its remarkable biodiversity. This archipelago of over 7,000 islands in Southeast Asia boasts an astonishing array of species and ecosystems. Numerous islands within the archipelago are thought to exhibit exceptionally high levels of endemism, encompassing a minimum of 25 plant genera and accounting for 50% of the terrestrial wildlife. The nation is a habitat to more than 52,000 documented species, with over half of them existing exclusively within its borders. When considering the area-to-diversity ratio, it's likely that the Philippines contains a greater variety of life forms than any other country on Earth.21. ArgentinaGlobal Biodiversity Index: 198.74Given its diverse range of habitats, Argentina naturally boasts abundant biodiversity. The country is home to slightly over 1,000 bird species, a wealth of flora, and numerous hundreds of mammal, reptile, and amphibian species, among them the likes of Jaguars, Orcas, and critically endangered frogs.20. ThailandGlobal Biodiversity Index: 200.77Situated in the tropical expanse of Southeast Asia, Thailand spans 513,120 square kilometers and is home to a population of approximately 69 million. As an upper-middle-income economy, Thailand is blessed with a diverse ecosystem and abundant biodiversity, which hold significant importance for both local communities and the nation's overall development.

80,710aed76-6d43-3947-9481-62646d66d73e,GT,2023-09-11,7 Stocks to Buy to Profit from a Flat Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-profit-flat-171557284.html,1693847757,STORY,"['VLO', 'SWKS', 'TMUS', 'WMT', 'WTRG', 'DFS', 'GT']","[While the equities sector might not collapse (a la the Great Recession), it might not offer a decisively directional motion, which augurs well for stocks to buy for a flat market. Generally, investors have two choices: buy enterprises that may enjoy greater success, or short companies that may fail eventually.But what do you do when the market runs neither hot or cold? In that case, you’re going to want to direct your stocks to buy on businesses that benefit from consistent demand. Most of these names hardly warrant the description “sexy.” Rather, they’re boring “AF” as the kids like to say. However, these flat market stock picks may protect your wealth during ambiguous cycles.After such an extraordinary run following the Covid-19 crisis, it just might be time for a cooling off. Assuming that Wall Street doesn’t fall off a cliff, these are the stocks to buy ahead of a non-committal market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGoodyear Tire (GT)Sign for Goodyear (GT) tire shop. The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company is an American tire manufacturing company.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comWhen discussing boring enterprises, I’m not sure it gets much more snooze-inducing than Goodyear Tire (NASDAQ:GT). To be clear, Goodyear is a critical business, providing high-quality tires for various vehicle classes. However, neither the average consumer nor investor gets up in the morning excited about vulcanization. Nevertheless, as an idea for stocks to buy, GT could be intriguing.According to data from S&amp;P Global Mobility, the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways reached 12.5 years, a dubious record. Basically, this framework tells us that people are not out buying new replacement vehicles. Instead, they’re making their dollars stretch by staying with their current vehicles until they can’t run anymore.That might lift GT because a fresh set of tires is a lot cheaper than buying a new or used car. Plus, it’s an unavoidable expense. To be fair, GT – while being a consensus moderate buy among analysts – may only rise modestly. Still, that’s a lot better than incurring a loss.Story continuesSkyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comWhile technology firms may not see much inclusion as flat market stock picks (due to their volatility risk), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) might be worth investigating. Focusing on high-performance analog semiconductors, Skyworks empowers the wireless networking revolution, per its website. Also, the company commands 4,600 patents and over 6,000 customers. In addition, it claims positive environmental impacts, improving energy and water efficiency by over 20%.Given the wide relevancies of the business, it’s not surprising that Skyworks offers a compelling financial profile. Specifically, its three-year revenue growth (per-share basis) hits 20.2%, above 69.4% of its peers. As well, its consistently profitable, printing a trailing-year net margin of 20.97%.Over the trailing one-year period, SWKS gained over 11% of equity value. However, there could be more gains on tap given that it’s undervalued, trading at a forward multiple of only 11.99x. Lastly, while SWKS carries a moderate buy consensus view among analysts, its $118.27 price target implies less than 8% upside. However, it also carries a forward yield of 2.48%, a factor that should be considered.Walmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the world’s most famous big-box retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) fits into many narratives. Unsurprisingly, it’s a great candidate for stocks to buy for a flat market. Thanks to its business innovations like everyday low pricing, Walmart offers tremendous relevance no matter what the market cycle. However, if the economy continues to trudge along horizontally, WMT could be an enticing idea to enliven your portfolio.While it’s not the sexiest idea out there, Walmart delivers demand predictability. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate at 7% ranks better than 58.68% of its peers. That’s not remarkable but it’s solid. Also, the company benefits from consistently profitability. Notably, its return on equity (ROE) comes in at 18.55%, above the sector median of 8.65%.As for passive income, Walmart isn’t generous, featuring a forward yield of only 1.41%. However, the company does command 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. Also, it’s a consensus strong buy among analysts, who anticipate shares hitting $178.32 or more than 10% higher.Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comA downstream petroleum company, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on the manufacturing and marketing of transportation fuels, other petrochemical products and power. Since the start of the year, VLO gained over 11% of equity value. However, in the trailing month ended Sept. 1, VLO gained nearly 6%. With a combination of geopolitics and tightening hydrocarbon supplies, VLO could rise higher.That might be the case even if the rest of the market goes sideways. Unlike a purely discretionary enterprise, Valero aligns with a wider necessity. Sure, some folks are pivoting toward electric vehicles. But the vast majority of drivers in the U.S. drive combustion vehicles. Given the troubling consumer economic headwinds, relatively few can comfortably afford the EV transition. Thus, VLO represents a cynical idea for stocks to buy for a flat market.Notably, VLO carries a forward yield of 3.05%. Moreover, analysts peg VLO a moderate buy with a $149.09 price target, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Discover Financial (DFS)the Discover (DFS) logo displayed outdoorsSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American financial services company, Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) might be best known for owning and operating Discover Bank, an online financial institution. Along with providing checking and savings accounts along with various lending programs, the bank also provides credit cards. Cynically, this business may empower DFS as one of the stocks to buy for a flat market. It’s also controversial and risky.As you’ve probably heard by now, Americans’ credit card debt exceeded $1 trillion, a dubious record in my opinion. Some like Bloomberg might interpret this as a sign of strength. However, a good portion of this debt load centers on households not being able to make ends meet otherwise. On one hand, companies like Discover can help keep folks afloat. But on the other hand, it may seem like preying on misfortune.Of course, the risk is sustainability. If people can’t pay their bills, Discover may have to eat the bad debt. Still, analysts are willing to give it a shot, pegging DFS a buy with a $113.53 price target. This forecast implies over 23% upside potential.T-Mobile (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: ShutterstockAs a wireless network operator, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an intriguing idea for flat market stock picks due to its pertinence. Many years ago, cellphones were basically toys for the rich. Today, it’s almost impossible to live without a smart device. Further, as a viable competitor to the top wireless enterprises, T-Mobile provides a much-needed consumer alternative.Another reason why TMUS could be one of the stocks to buy centers on its penchant for share repurchases. As a Motley Fool article argued recently, share repurchases can be a more tax-efficient way for returning excess cash to shareholders. This thesis seems to carry a significant ring of truth.In the trailing one-year period, TMUS lost a bit more than 3%. In sharp contrast, VZ stumbled almost 16% during the same period. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg TMUS as a consensus strong buy. Among 13 experts, the worst individual rating is a hold. Also, the average price target comes in at $179.46, implying nearly 31% upside.Essential Utilities (WTRG)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comA proposition for stocks to buy reserved only for speculators, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) may be pertinent, but it’s also risky. Since the beginning of this year, WTRG gave up nearly 24% of its equity value. What raises eyebrows is that during the past five years, WTRG lost about 2%. That’s not exactly the way to endear prospective investors.At the same time, utility firms like Essential benefit from a natural monopoly. Basically, the barriers to entry for the underlying industry is so steep that would -be competitors don’t even bother. Also, Essential truly lives up to its name thanks to its ultra-critical drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. On the passive income front, the company carries a forward yield of 3.35%, which is pretty decent. Also, it commands 32 years of consecutive dividend increases. On a final note, analysts peg WTRG a consensus moderate buy. The average price target stands at $54, implying over 47% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

A new exploratory post-hoc analysis of right heart catheterization and echocardiography data from patients in the Phase 3 STELLAR study showed treatment with sotatercept for 24 weeks on top of background therapy reduced right heart size and improved right-ventricular (RV) function and hemodynamic status. This analysis was featured in an oral presentation, with simultaneous publication in the European Respiratory Journal. An interim analysis of the Phase 3 SOTERIA open-label extension study was also presented, representing the longest safety and efficacy analysis of sotatercept to date.""There is an urgent need for new approaches to manage PAH, a rare, progressive, and ultimately life-threatening disease,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These latest data build on the clinically meaningful efficacy results from the STELLAR trial and support our belief that sotatercept has the potential to transform the treatment of PAH. PAH can strain the heart and lead to eventual right heart failure, so we are particularly encouraged by the exploratory analysis from STELLAR suggesting that treatment with sotatercept improved right heart size and function.""Story continuesPrimary efficacy results from STELLAR, in which sotatercept on top of background therapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 24 weeks and eight of nine secondary outcome measures, were presented at ACC.23/WCC and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Merck submitted an application for regulatory approval of sotatercept to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and plans to submit applications to additional regulatory agencies worldwide.At ERS 2023, nine Merck-sponsored studies in PAH were presented. These include an oral presentation of a population health model predicting the long-term impact of sotatercept on morbidity and mortality in patients with PAH (#OA740).Results from STELLAR hemodynamics and echocardiography analysis (Abstract #3111)An exploratory post-hoc analysis from the STELLAR trial evaluated the effects of sotatercept on select hemodynamic parameters and right-ventricle (RV) function. The STELLAR trial enrolled 323 adults with PAH, randomized to receive sotatercept (n=163) or placebo (n=160), on top of background therapy. Participants with available data at screening and week 24 visits were included in this post-hoc analysis, which reported hemodynamic data from 298 participants and echocardiography data from 275 participants, representing 92% and 85% of total participants respectively. In the analysis, after 24 weeks, sotatercept was associated with meaningful improvements in certain measures of hemodynamic status and RV function.Results from this exploratory analysis showed treatment with sotatercept compared to placebo, on top of background therapy, led to improvements from baseline in mean pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure (−13.9 mmHg), PA compliance (0.58 mL mmHg−1), pulmonary vascular resistance (−254.8 dyn·s·cm−5), mean right atrial pressure (−2.7 mmHg), mixed venous oxygen saturation (3.84%), PA elastance (−0.42 mmHg mL−1 beat−1), cardiac efficiency (0.48 mL beat−1 mmHg−1), RV work (−0.85 g·m) and RV power (−32.70 mmHg·L min−1). Echocardiography data showed improvements in the ratio of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (TAPSE/sPAP; 0.12 mm mmHg−1), end-systolic and end-diastolic RV areas (−4.39 cm2 and −5.31 cm2, respectively), tricuspid regurgitation and RV fractional area change (2.04% p&lt;0.050). No significant between-group changes from baseline were seen for TAPSE, heart rate, cardiac output/index or stroke volume/stroke volume index.""Despite available therapies, PAH remains incurable, with high morbidity and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for novel treatments that target new pathways,"" said Dr. Vallerie McLaughlin*, professor of medicine and director, Pulmonary Hypertension Program, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. ""Sotatercept is the first activin signaling inhibitor therapy and is proposed to modulate the vascular proliferation underlying PAH. Acknowledging the exploratory nature of these findings, this is the first clinical evidence suggesting that sotatercept may positively impact certain measures of right heart function and dimensions. This is encouraging and further supports the primary results from the STELLAR analysis, underscoring the potential of sotatercept to play a critical role in the treatment of PAH.""Results from SOTERIA study (Abstract #OA739)SOTERIA (NCT04796337) is an ongoing open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of sotatercept when added to background therapy for the treatment of PAH in patients who have completed previous sotatercept studies without early discontinuation. The primary objective of SOTERIA is to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability. The secondary objective is to assess the continued efficacy of sotatercept, as measured by 6MWD, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), WHO functional class (FC), pulmonary vascular resistance, overall survival, and simplified French risk score.""The SOTERIA study provides us with important insight into the longer-term safety and efficacy of sotatercept,"" said Dr. Ioana Preston, director of the Pulmonary Hypertension Center and associate professor at Tufts University School of Medicine. ""These results support the potential durability of clinical benefit and safety of sotatercept for the treatment of PAH.""At the data cutoff of April 20, 2023, there were 409 participants enrolled in SOTERIA. All participants were evaluated for safety. The median duration of exposure to sotatercept was 462 days (range: 21-1,762 days), including any exposure to sotatercept during the parent study. One hundred forty-three participants rolled over from placebo. The median duration of exposure to sotatercept in SOTERIA was 189 days.Sotatercept was well-tolerated and the safety profile was similar to previous studies. 98.5% of participants were on treatment at the time of the interim analysis. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 81.7% (n=334/409) of participants. Serious TEAEs occurred in 19.3% of participants but only a small proportion lead to treatment discontinuation (1.5%; n=6/409) or death (1.0%; n=4/409). Additionally, 22.7% (n=93/409) of participants experienced a telangiectasia event, 0% had a serious telangiectasia event, 0% discontinued treatment and 1% experienced dose reductions or holds due to telangiectasia. Clinical worsening events were documented. Seven participants (1.7%) experienced nine clinical worsening events.Improvements in clinical efficacy measures measured at week 24 in SOTERIA were maintained at one year during the open-label period. One hundred thirty-one participants who reached one year of therapy in SOTERIA were evaluated for efficacy at one year; most of these participants rolled over from the Phase 2 sotatercept studies, PULSAR and SPECTRA trials. Mean change (SD) from baseline at week 24 in 6MWD (20.2 ±66.5 m) and NT-proBNP (−374.9 ±1479.4 pg/mL) were largely maintained at one year (10.9 ±73.6 m and −227.2 ±1580.1 pg/mL, respectively). The proportion of participants who improved or maintained WHO FC II from baseline at week 24 (77.2%) was similar to that at one year (76.3%). 30.1% of participants achieved low French risk score (WHO-FC I/II, 6MWD &gt;440 m, NT-proBNP &lt;300 pg/mL) at week 24, and 37.4% at one year.Changes in background PAH therapy were also documented for all participants. Of participants on any prostacyclin, 29/272 (10.7%) had prostacyclin dose decreases. Of participants on infusion prostacyclin, 22/154 (14.3%) had prostacyclin dose decreases. Of participants on other PAH therapy, 21/406 (5.2%) had other PAH therapy dose decreases and 19/406 (4.6%) had other PAH therapy dose increased. As of April 20, 2023, 8 participants had discontinued prostacyclins entirely.Summary of PresentationsMerck-sponsored studies and analyses for PAH, sotatercept and MK-5475, an investigational inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, featured at ERS International Congress 2023 include:Clinical studiesEffects of Sotatercept on Haemodynamics and Right Heart Function: Analysis of STELLAR Trial; Marius M.

Approximately 40,000 people in the U.S. are living with PAH. The disease progresses rapidly for many patients. PAH results in significant strain on the heart, leading to limited physical activity, heart failure and reduced life expectancy. The five-year mortality rate for patients with PAH is approximately 43%.About sotaterceptSotatercept is an investigational, potential first-in-class activin signaling inhibitor biologic being studied for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group 1). PAH is a rare disease caused by hyperproliferation of cells in the arterial walls in the lung, leading to narrowing and abnormal constriction. In pre-clinical models, sotatercept has been shown to modulate vascular cell proliferation, reversing vascular and right ventricle remodeling.In addition to STELLAR and SOTERIA, the sotatercept clinical development program includes multiple Phase 2 and 3 trials across a broad range of patients. Studies are underway in adult patients with PAH (WHO Group 1) at intermediate or high risk of disease progression or mortality, as well as with pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (WHO Group 2).Merck acquired exclusive rights to sotatercept in the pulmonary hypertension field through the acquisition of Acceleron Pharma Inc. Sotatercept is the subject of a licensing agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb.About MK-5475MK-5475 is an investigational dry-powder formulation of a small-molecule stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), designed for inhaled delivery to the pulmonary arterial circulation through the lungs. MK-5475 may stimulate sGC in the blood vessels of the lungs, which, if occurring, relaxes and widens these blood vessels. It is currently being studied in a Phase 2/3 trial for the treatment of PAH and a Phase 2 trial for the treatment of PH associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Merck’s focus on cardiovascular diseaseMerck has a long history of making an impact in cardiovascular disease.

Generally, investors have two choices: buy enterprises that may enjoy greater success, or short companies that may fail eventually.But what do you do when the market runs neither hot or cold? In that case, you’re going to want to direct your stocks to buy on businesses that benefit from consistent demand. Most of these names hardly warrant the description “sexy.” Rather, they’re boring “AF” as the kids like to say. However, these flat market stock picks may protect your wealth during ambiguous cycles.After such an extraordinary run following the Covid-19 crisis, it just might be time for a cooling off. Assuming that Wall Street doesn’t fall off a cliff, these are the stocks to buy ahead of a non-committal market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGoodyear Tire (GT)Sign for Goodyear (GT) tire shop. The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company is an American tire manufacturing company.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comWhen discussing boring enterprises, I’m not sure it gets much more snooze-inducing than Goodyear Tire (NASDAQ:GT). To be clear, Goodyear is a critical business, providing high-quality tires for various vehicle classes. However, neither the average consumer nor investor gets up in the morning excited about vulcanization. Nevertheless, as an idea for stocks to buy, GT could be intriguing.According to data from S&amp;P Global Mobility, the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways reached 12.5 years, a dubious record. Basically, this framework tells us that people are not out buying new replacement vehicles. Instead, they’re making their dollars stretch by staying with their current vehicles until they can’t run anymore.That might lift GT because a fresh set of tires is a lot cheaper than buying a new or used car. Plus, it’s an unavoidable expense. To be fair, GT – while being a consensus moderate buy among analysts – may only rise modestly. Still, that’s a lot better than incurring a loss.Story continuesSkyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comWhile technology firms may not see much inclusion as flat market stock picks (due to their volatility risk), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) might be worth investigating. Focusing on high-performance analog semiconductors, Skyworks empowers the wireless networking revolution, per its website. Also, the company commands 4,600 patents and over 6,000 customers. In addition, it claims positive environmental impacts, improving energy and water efficiency by over 20%.Given the wide relevancies of the business, it’s not surprising that Skyworks offers a compelling financial profile. Specifically, its three-year revenue growth (per-share basis) hits 20.2%, above 69.4% of its peers. As well, its consistently profitable, printing a trailing-year net margin of 20.97%.Over the trailing one-year period, SWKS gained over 11% of equity value. However, there could be more gains on tap given that it’s undervalued, trading at a forward multiple of only 11.99x. Lastly, while SWKS carries a moderate buy consensus view among analysts, its $118.27 price target implies less than 8% upside. However, it also carries a forward yield of 2.48%, a factor that should be considered.Walmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the world’s most famous big-box retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) fits into many narratives. Unsurprisingly, it’s a great candidate for stocks to buy for a flat market. Thanks to its business innovations like everyday low pricing, Walmart offers tremendous relevance no matter what the market cycle. However, if the economy continues to trudge along horizontally, WMT could be an enticing idea to enliven your portfolio.While it’s not the sexiest idea out there, Walmart delivers demand predictability. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate at 7% ranks better than 58.68% of its peers. That’s not remarkable but it’s solid. Also, the company benefits from consistently profitability. Notably, its return on equity (ROE) comes in at 18.55%, above the sector median of 8.65%.As for passive income, Walmart isn’t generous, featuring a forward yield of only 1.41%. However, the company does command 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. Also, it’s a consensus strong buy among analysts, who anticipate shares hitting $178.32 or more than 10% higher.Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comA downstream petroleum company, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on the manufacturing and marketing of transportation fuels, other petrochemical products and power. Since the start of the year, VLO gained over 11% of equity value. However, in the trailing month ended Sept. 1, VLO gained nearly 6%. With a combination of geopolitics and tightening hydrocarbon supplies, VLO could rise higher.That might be the case even if the rest of the market goes sideways. Unlike a purely discretionary enterprise, Valero aligns with a wider necessity. Sure, some folks are pivoting toward electric vehicles. But the vast majority of drivers in the U.S. drive combustion vehicles. Given the troubling consumer economic headwinds, relatively few can comfortably afford the EV transition. Thus, VLO represents a cynical idea for stocks to buy for a flat market.Notably, VLO carries a forward yield of 3.05%. Moreover, analysts peg VLO a moderate buy with a $149.09 price target, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Discover Financial (DFS)the Discover (DFS) logo displayed outdoorsSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American financial services company, Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) might be best known for owning and operating Discover Bank, an online financial institution. Along with providing checking and savings accounts along with various lending programs, the bank also provides credit cards. Cynically, this business may empower DFS as one of the stocks to buy for a flat market. It’s also controversial and risky.As you’ve probably heard by now, Americans’ credit card debt exceeded $1 trillion, a dubious record in my opinion. Some like Bloomberg might interpret this as a sign of strength. However, a good portion of this debt load centers on households not being able to make ends meet otherwise. On one hand, companies like Discover can help keep folks afloat. But on the other hand, it may seem like preying on misfortune.Of course, the risk is sustainability. If people can’t pay their bills, Discover may have to eat the bad debt. Still, analysts are willing to give it a shot, pegging DFS a buy with a $113.53 price target. This forecast implies over 23% upside potential.T-Mobile (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: ShutterstockAs a wireless network operator, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an intriguing idea for flat market stock picks due to its pertinence. Many years ago, cellphones were basically toys for the rich. Today, it’s almost impossible to live without a smart device. Further, as a viable competitor to the top wireless enterprises, T-Mobile provides a much-needed consumer alternative.Another reason why TMUS could be one of the stocks to buy centers on its penchant for share repurchases. As a Motley Fool article argued recently, share repurchases can be a more tax-efficient way for returning excess cash to shareholders. This thesis seems to carry a significant ring of truth.In the trailing one-year period, TMUS lost a bit more than 3%. In sharp contrast, VZ stumbled almost 16% during the same period. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg TMUS as a consensus strong buy. Among 13 experts, the worst individual rating is a hold. Also, the average price target comes in at $179.46, implying nearly 31% upside.Essential Utilities (WTRG)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comA proposition for stocks to buy reserved only for speculators, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) may be pertinent, but it’s also risky. Since the beginning of this year, WTRG gave up nearly 24% of its equity value. What raises eyebrows is that during the past five years, WTRG lost about 2%. That’s not exactly the way to endear prospective investors.At the same time, utility firms like Essential benefit from a natural monopoly. Basically, the barriers to entry for the underlying industry is so steep that would -be competitors don’t even bother. Also, Essential truly lives up to its name thanks to its ultra-critical drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. On the passive income front, the company carries a forward yield of 3.35%, which is pretty decent. Also, it commands 32 years of consecutive dividend increases. On a final note, analysts peg WTRG a consensus moderate buy. The average price target stands at $54, implying over 47% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Yes, CNBC reported that with the Dow Jones closing more than 100 points to kick off September, the index notched its best week since July. However, this is a marathon, not a one-off sprint.Following some strong performances, post-pandemic, the Dow has been rather disappointing. Since the start of this year, the index only gained just over 5%. Further, major questions about economic stability warrant skepticism. Perhaps most notably, Americans’ credit card debt breached the ignominious $1 trillion level. Not surprisingly, many retailers report that consumers are pulling back off discretionary expenditures.Another factor to consider is that home prices may be on the verge of cooling. But in the grand scheme of things, that might not be a great sign. Basically, consumers are tapped out, thus pointing to broader anxieties. With so many ambiguities to consider, your best bet may be with these defensive stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLowe’s (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comAs a retail company specializing in home improvement, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) is an ideal candidate for defensive stocks. Thanks to the colloquial phenomenon known as Murphy’s Law, no one can predict when circumstances go awry. However, whether that be a pipe breaking or a smoke detector going off in the wee hours of the morning, these incidents have a way of happening at the absolute wrong time.For that, Lowe’s provides a readymade solution, whether via its retail stores or its delivery services. In addition, LOW can still potentially benefit from the Covid-19 outbreak. With the economic events tied to the crisis sparking a homebuying surge, it’s quite possible that the total addressable market for the retailer has increased. After all, homeownership means owning all the problems that materialize with your property.Story continuesFinally, Lowe’s carries a forward yield of 1.89%. Although not particularly generous, the company commands 50 years of consecutive dividend increases.Northrop Grumman (NOC)Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comAn aerospace and defense contractor, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) may be controversial to some because of its underlying business. However, with geopolitical tensions skyrocketing across several regions, I don’t think investors can ignore the potential of NOC. No, we should not celebrate rising furor in the geopolitical space. At the same time, we can’t afford to be caught flatfooted regarding our national security profile.On a more constructive note, Northrop also represents a viable play for defensive stocks to buy thanks to the space economy. Per its website, the company has invested heavily in making the space industry a viable one, including supporting NASA’s Artemis program. Therefore, NOC moves beyond just the defense component of its business.Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 1.72%. That’s a bit lower than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. However, Northrop also commands 20 years of consecutive dividend increases.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comEasily one of the best ideas for defensive stocks to buy, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is a clear beneficiary of the trade-down effect. It’s terribly cynical, just as a warning. However, during times of economic challenges, people might forego certain medical or dental procedures. Still, even with that being the case, very few will skimp out on Colgate-branded products.Fundamentally, one of the easiest ways to care for yourself is to foster proper oral hygiene. Yes, it sounds like such a painfully obvious point, but that’s also the driving factor behind CL stock. People will avoid going to the dentist’s office for various reasons; mainly economic for some and for others, fear. But demand for Colgate should be relatively consistent.Just as well, the company carries a forward yield of 2.62%. This stat runs a little bit higher than the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%. But the main takeaway has got to be its 61 years of consecutive dividend increases.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAlthough one of the more exciting technology plays thanks to its investments in artificial intelligence, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also qualifies as one of the top defensive stocks to buy. From a quick glance at its financial profile, the tech giant benefits from consistent profitability. Also, it sports an impressive trailing-year operating margin of 41.77% and a net margin of 34.15%.In other words, it’s a name you can trust, an important component of defensive stocks. Further, MSFT may continue to reward shareholders, even with it moving up over 37% since the January opener. Fundamentally, the underlying company’s AI initiatives are taking off like wildfire.Regarding passive income, Microsoft is hardly what you call generous, printing a forward yield of 0.83%. Now, it has seen 20 years of dividend increases. And its payout ratio sits at 24.75%, which provides confidence in terms of yield sustainability. Lastly, analysts peg MSFT as a strong buy. Their average price target clocks in at $391.88, implying over 19% upside potential.Mondelez (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockA multinational confectionary and food company, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) also features a beverage business. Offering some of the most recognizable snack brands in the world, Mondelez offers a cynical play for defensive stocks. Moving forward, if the consumer economy continues to struggle against headwinds like inflation, MDLZ should benefit from steadily rising demand.Now, I’m not suggesting that MDLZ will skyrocket like a cryptocurrency. But with retailers reporting that shoppers are becoming choosier about their expenditures – going for discounted items or bundled products – it’s reasonably clear that the trade-down phenomenon is at work. People still want to spend, as various retail reports demonstrate. They just want to do so prudently.While not immensely generous, Mondelez offers a forward yield of 2.44%. That’s above the consumer staples sector’s yield of 1.89%. Also, the payout ratio is quite reasonable at 48.2%. Thus, stakeholders don’t have to worry much about the sustainability of the yield.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)A table is spread with breakfast foods like orange juice, berries and croissants. represents food and beverage stocksSource: ShutterstockArguably a no-brainer for defensive stocks to buy, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a multinational food processing and commodities trading firm. Per its public profile, Archer Daniels operates more than 270 plants and 420 crop procurement facilities worldwide. To be fair, geopolitical flashpoints have put pressure on commodities vital to the global food supply chain. As a result, ADM slipped 11% since the January opener.At the same time, Archer Daniels benefits from predictability. As investment data aggregator Gurufocus points out, the company is consistently profitable. On a per-share basis, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 16.4%, above 76.74% of its peers. Eventually, under trying economic circumstances, people will focus primarily on the essentials. That should be great news for ADM.As for passive income, Archer Daniels carries a forward yield of 2.26%. While not generous, the company commands 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. Very few companies can claim that, making ADM one of the top defensive stocks to consider.Jack in the Box (JACK)stocks to sellSource: LifetimeStock / Shutterstock.comAlthough a discretionary play in the broader retail ecosystem, Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK) could be intriguing for conservative contrarians. Yes, if the economy continues to encounter significant challenges, people will be tempted to cut out all discretionary spending. However, let’s be real. We’re talking about a country that has over $1 trillion in credit card debt. Will this citizenry cut spending to the bone?I don’t want to turn this article into a clown show with commentary that fails to age well. However, the general trend toward household cutbacks involves trading down gradually, not cutting all at once. Since Jack in the Box offers a guilty pleasure via fast food, it could be an interesting idea. First, the company’s forward yield comes in at 2.14%. While that’s not high, the payout ratio sits at 25.71%, allowing stakeholders to sleep a bit easier. Second, analysts peg JACK as a consensus moderate buy with a $102.18 price target, implying over 24% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Fox is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$2.7b ÷ (US$22b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Fox has an ROCE of 15%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Media industry average of 8.1% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Fox roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Fox compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Fox here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Fox, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 15% from 19% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom Line On Fox's ROCETo conclude, we've found that Fox is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 14% to shareholders over the last three years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Fox  that we think you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our detailed industry analysis, head straight to the Top 5 AI and Robotics Companies Transforming the Agriculture Sector. The global agriculture market, as of 2023, has witnessed huge growth, with a market size increasing from $12.25 trillion in 2022 to $13.40 trillion in 2023 and marked a 9.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), as noted by Research and Markets. This expansion can be attributed to several factors, like the increasing global population, which is projected to reach 10 billion by 2050 and has led a to heightened food demand. Crop production, a major component of agriculture, has seen considerable growth, with global cereal production expected to increase by 13% by 2027. Agribusiness companies are also actively acquiring arable land to boost crop production and meet the rising demands. It is also worth highlighting that owing to the rising demand of labor in agriculture, farming has emerged as one of the most respected professions in the world.How Is Artificial Intelligence Transforming the Agriculture Industry?We have already established many industries are being revolutionzed by AI and automation technologies and hence, agriculture industry is no exception. It is also worth mentioning that Agricultural Robots, Predictive Analytics, and, Crop and Soil Monitoring are the three most popular applications of AI in agriculture.  Smart farming, powered by IoT technology, is revolutionizing agriculture by leveraging sensors, gateways, and data analysis to optimize crop management. These sensors capture essential data from fields, which is then stored and analyzed on cloud platforms. This enables farmers to access real-time insights through user-friendly dashboards, facilitating more efficient and informed decision-making. To read more about Iot, check out our article on Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the World.Story continuesMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), one the key artificial intelligence companies in USA, is actively contributing to the transformative trend of smart farming through its Azure Data Manager for Agriculture. This innovative solution by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) addresses critical challenges in the agriculture industry by harnessing data and technology. Azure Data Manager for Agriculture connects data sources across farms, breaking down data silos and provides valuable insights into soil health, weather patterns, waste tracking, and carbon sequestration. Hence, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is undoubtedly one of the top AI companies transforming the agriculture sector. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s collaboration with industry leaders like Bayer and Land O'Lakes demonstrates the practical application of this technology. For example, Bayer utilizes Azure Data Manager to offer insights to farmers through its FieldView platform, enhancing yield predictions and crop health monitoring. Land O'Lakes uses the tool to empower farmers to adopt sustainable practices through its Truterra sustainability tool, which tracks environmental impacts. Similarly, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s Environmental Intelligence Suite has revolutionized agriculture with AI-driven solutions. It provides real-time weather data and machine learning-powered forecasting for precise crop management, supply chain optimization, and market demand predictions. This empowers agribusinesses to navigate the challenges of climate change and food security by making informed decisions. This suite by International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) offers hyper-local weather data for customized farming applications, helping with planting, feeding, spraying, and irrigation scheduling. A number of case studies have proven its  impact, from reducing power outages in India to enhancing water usage insights for Texan farmers. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s suite equips the agriculture industry with the tools to thrive in the digital age.On the other hand, precision agriculture is becoming increasingly vital in modern farming, as it offers huge benefits and is on the rise despite its high associated costs. With technological developments, farmers can now measure and manage specific segments of their fields in real-time that results in improved efficiency. For instance, farmers like Bret Johnson have reported huge gains in yield and resource management through precision agriculture, with the ability to reduce nitrogen usage from the average of 1.2 pounds per bushel to as little as half a pound per bushel. Moreover, precision agriculture tools can identify and address plant and insect diseases that improve the overall crop health. However, widespread adoption of the technology faces hurdles due to substantial initial investments, such as tens of thousands of dollars for tools like yield monitors, guidance systems, and drones, along with ongoing subscription fees and training costs. Nonetheless, for early adopters, precision agriculture is indispensable for risk mitigation and improved farm management.Deere &amp; Co (NYSE:DE)  is spearheading a revolution in precision farming by harnessing advanced technologies to optimize agricultural practices. Through the integration of space technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics, Deere &amp; Co (NYSE:DE) is providing farmers with invaluable insights. They utilize satellite imagery to monitor crops more effectively, pinpointing variations in soil moisture, nutrient levels, and plant health with precision. This data-driven approach minimizes resource wastage and maximizes yields, ultimately benefitting both farmers and the environment.Furthermore, Deere &amp; Co (NYSE:DE) has invested in electric tractors that boast low maintenance costs, a testament to their commitment to sustainability. These tractors are powered by batteries and reduce emissions and operating costs for farmers.

The report is set to show headline inflation continues to reverse its downtrend as oil prices rise.On the corporate side, Apple (AAPL) is scheduled to host its marquee fall event on Tuesday, with new iPhones, Apple Watches, and a new charging port for most devices expected to be announced.A September 14 deadline also looms in a contract dispute between the United Auto Workers and automakers Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), with workers threatening a strike when their current deal expires on Thursday.Last week, markets continued choppy trading that began back in August as concerns over sticky price inflation from an August report on the services sector sent stocks lower on Wednesday, while a decline in tech stocks over fears regarding China's economy weighed on equity markets.The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) led the losses, falling near 2% during the holiday-shortened trading week. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.4%Inflation will be in focus this week with Wall Street expecting another uptick in headline inflation.Economists forecast headline inflation rose 3.6% over the prior year in August, an increase from the 3.2% rise seen in July. Prices are set to rise 0.6% on a monthly basis. An increase in energy prices is expected to drive much of the increase.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, CPI is forecast to rise 4.3% over last year in August, a slowdown from the 4.7% increase seen in July. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.2%.The Federal Reserve's closer focus on core inflation has economists and investors confident the central bank won't raise rates in September. As of Friday, markets had priced in a 92% chance the Fed holds interest rates steady at the conclusion of its September 19-20 meeting, according to data from the CME Group.Story continues""We do not expect that [CPI data] will tip the scales towards a hike, given the mixed message delivered by the other employment reports and last month's inflation data,"" Jefferies economist Thomas Simons wrote on Friday.Also out this week will be the August retail sales report, which will provide a look at how resilient US consumers remain after a strong summer. Economists expect retail sales increased 0.1% in August, a noted decrease from the 0.7% jump seen in July.Data on producer prices, a read on small business optimism, and the weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance will also feature on the economic calendar.iPhone debutApple's update of its signature product on Tuesday is expected to be a market moving event, and comes at a critical juncture for America's biggest public company.Apple stock slipped more than 6% in a two-day period last week after Chinese officials told employees at central government agencies to not use iPhones at work. A new high-end phone release from China's Huawei also added pressure on Apple.Some analysts, though, said the selloff was ""overblown.""But this trading hangs in the background of Apple's event, dubbed ""Wonderlust,"" which is expected to see its iPhone lineup refreshed, new Apple Watches revealed, and the introduction of USB-C charging ports across its device lineup, sunsetting the lightning charger currently powering most iPhones.""Historically, the iPhone launch has been a sell-the-news event,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a preview of the event.""While we don't expect the day-of stock reaction to the September 12th Wonderlust event to be any different this year, we continue to believe that FY24 iPhone expectations are too low and that the iPhone 15 cycle is not as 'iterative' as anticipated, with the potential for both unit and [average selling price] growth.""Customers experience Apple products at an Apple store in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan province, Sept 8, 2023.

The stock has looked overvalued in the past, and a 111 P/E ratio is still on the high end.However, the high valuation should smooth out quickly, given the company’s otherworldly 843.3% year-over-year net income growth. Revenue also doubled year-over-year, and the company reported exceptional guidance that beat expectations.I expressed my concerns when the stock’s P/E ratio was 250. However, the current valuation combined with future growth opportunities makes the stock a more compelling pick.The stock has a more reasonable 47-forward P/E ratio that can become even more reasonable if the company continues its path of utter dominance in its earnings reports. Nvidia is exhibiting incredible financial strength. Investors should eventually expect decelerating revenue and net income growth rates.

Investors should remember that AMD is expected to release its competitor AI chips late this year. It’ll be about GPU chips which are much better suited to AI purposes. The company unveiled its Radeon RX 7800 XT and Radeon RX 7700 XT chips highlighting their AI functionality and optimization for AI workloads. AMD is closing the gap and investors worried that Nvidia is overvalued should pile into AMD as its potential becomes clearer in late 2023. Analog Devices (ADI)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockAnalog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is another chip stock to consider for investors looking beyond tech’s biggest players. The company produces integrated circuits, another name for chips that describes the wafers you might think of when envisioning a semiconductor chip. Story continuesThe company is particularly strong in the automotive and industrial sectors with revenues growing in both Q2 and Q3. Overall revenues declined by 1% during the period but increased over the prevailing 9-month term. Analog Devices was prudent during both periods and cut costs resulting in increased net income in Q2 and the trailing 9-month period. I like the company for its exposure to the automotive and industrial sectors. EVs and IoT will provide access to long-term growth that will benefit the company and provide it with growth options. Further, ADI shares include a dividend that was last reduced in 2004. It’s a stable firm with exposure to growth which is attractive to a large portion of investors overall. Adobe (ADBE)Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a significant player in the generative AI conversation. The stock is rising and I believe that its September 14 earnings will be strong. If true, that would be a continuation of the last 2 quarters during which Adobe reported EPS and revenue beats. The software giant known for Photoshop, Acrobat and Illustrator is continuing to grow at a steady pace after growing by 12% in 2022 to $17.6 billion. It’ll eclipse $19 billion this year and is on track to make $21 billion in sales in 2024. As with most other tech firms, Adobe’s growth is currently predicated upon generative AI. Its Firefly AI products are centered on the application of AI to its creative suite. The use of AI in creating graphics is clearly disrupting more traditional methods. Adobe has a clear opportunity at its feet. Enterprise revenues are an obvious point of attraction. Adobe is a massive enterprise creative software provider. It’s difficult to see why Adobe sales shouldn’t improve as AI integrations take root. UpWork (UPWK)upwork (UPWK) logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comUpwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) is one of the tech stocks to buy worth considering for a few prominent reasons. Firstly, Upwork is the biggest freelancer platform. More and more workers are either choosing to freelance on their own or simply being forced to as the economy shifts. The market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 16.5% through 2030 according to recent estimates. That will benefit Upwork significantly as the leading freelancer platform. Beyond the clear growth opportunity, Upwork is also worth considering for its trajectory. The firm found profitability during the first 6 months of 2023 posting $13.2 million in net income. That was a substantial improvement over the $48.5 million loss a year earlier during the same period. The firm has improved operations drastically while revenues continue to grow at a more modest pace. Upwork is also benefiting from the AI boom as many creators are plying their wares on the platform’s newly launched AI Services hub. SEMrush Holdings (SEMR)overhead shot of hands on a white keyboardSource: ShutterstockSEMrush Holdings (NYSE:SEMR) provides tools that help firms improve their search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM) rankings. In the digital age appearing earliest on Google and other search engines determines failure and success. Thus, SEMrush continues to experience strong demand. That strong demand is evident in the latest earnings report in which revenues grew by 19% to $74.7 million. ARR grew slightly faster, at 20%, representing contractual growth within the firm. It’s a particularly important metric because it indicates that the company is adept at maintaining relationships with its clients. Like Upwork, SEMrush is attractive because the firm is flirting with a pivot into profitability. The firm posted a net loss of $279 thousand in the second quarter. That figure narrowed significantly from $8.3 million a year earlier. The company raised its non-GAAP net income guidance to between $2 to $4 million from $0 to $3 million following the strong results. Fortinet (FTNT)The Fortinet logo on a wallSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) stock is now cheaper after plunging a few weeks ago. The drop was predicated on broad macroeconomic uncertainty. That said, Fortinet remains fundamentally strong and provided strong quarterly results that should serve to allay those broader fears. Fortinet is a cybersecurity firm with a particularly strong footing in the enterprise sector. Firms of all stripes are beefing up their security for a multitude of reasons and demand is increasing. That has resulted in strong top-line growth for Fortinet which saw sales jump 26% in the second quarter. Net income growth, at 54%, was even higher over the same period and points to a strong company with strong fiscal controls in place and a firm grasp on costs. Fortinet is projecting 20% growth moving forward. Enterprise security concerns are only growing as AI complicates the picture while simultaneously benefiting the firm. It’s difficult to find much to dislike which is why FTNT shares are a buy. Mastercard (MA)Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.comInvestors should understand that Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is a stock that is firing on all cylinders. Pretty much everything is in place for the firm to continue to improve making it a clear buy. A lot of that opportunity is based on the continued increase of U.S. credit card debt. Americans hold more than $1 trillion in collective credit card debt. Balances are rising as Americans deal with inflation by charging it to their cards while simultaneously allowing their balances to grow rather than paying them off. In turn, Mastercard’s revenues grew by 14% in Q2 and net income was up by 25%. Those figures are likely to balloon moving forward as the firm is set to increase merchant fees. That means firms that take credit card payments will now foot a larger fee for doing so while consumers should be largely shielded from the increases. In any case, Mastercard’s future revenue stream is only continuing to get brighter and brighter as American consumers fall further behind. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Cherney(Reuters) - Nvidia's supremacy in building computer chips for artificial intelligence has chilled venture funding for would-be rivals, investors said, with the number of U.S. deals this quarter falling 80% from a year ago.The Santa Clara, California company dominates the market for chips that work with massive amounts of language data. Generative AI models get incrementally smarter through exposure to more data, a process called training.As Nvidia has grown stronger in this area, the harder it has become for companies attempting to build competing chips. Seeing these startups as a riskier bet, venture financiers are newly unwilling to provide big cash infusions. Advancing a chip design to a working prototype can cost more than $500 million, so the pullback has quickly threatened the startups' prospects.""Nvidia’s continued dominance has put a really fine point on how hard it is to break into this market,"" said Greg Reichow, a partner at Eclipse Ventures. ""This has resulted in a pullback in investment into these companies, or at least into many of them.""U.S. chip startups have raised $881.4 million through the end of August, according to PitchBook data. That compares to $1.79 billion for the first three quarters of 2022. The number of deals has dropped from 23 to four through the end of August.Nvidia declined to comment.AI chip startup Mythic, which has raised about $160 million in total, ran out of cash last year and was nearly forced to halt operations, technology website The Register reported. But it managed to bring in a relatively modest $13 million investment several months later in March.Nvidia has ""indirectly"" contributed to overall AI chip fundraising woes, because investors want ""Home run only type investments with a huge investment, huge return,"" Mythic CEO Dave Rick said.Difficult economic conditions have added to the downturn in the cyclical semiconductor industry, Rick said.Story continuesA secretive startup called Rivos, which is working on chip designs for data servers has had trouble raising funding recently, said two sources familiar with the company's situation.A Rivos spokesperson said Nvidia's market dominance hasn't hindered its fundraising efforts and its hardware and software ""continues to excite our investors.""Rivos is embroiled in litigation with Apple, which has accused Rivos of stealing intellectual property, and this has compounded the fundraising challenge.DEMANDING INVESTORSChip startups looking to raise cash are facing tougher demands from investors. They require companies to have a product that is within months of launch or already generating sales, sources said.About two years ago, new investments in chip startups were often $200 million or $300 million. That has fallen to about $100 million, according to PitchBook analyst Brendan Burke.At least two AI chip startups have overcome investor reluctance by trumpeting potential customers or their relationships with well-known executives.To raise $100 million in August, Tenstorrent boasted about CEO Jim Keller, a near legendary chip architect who has designed chips for Apple, Advanced Micro Devices and Tesla.D-Matrix, which has projected revenue of less than $10 million this year, raised $110 million last week, bolstered by financial backing from Microsoft and a commitment by the Windows maker to test d-Matrix's new AI chip after it launches next year.While these chip makers in Nvidia's shadow struggle, startups in AI software and related technologies do not face the same constraints. They brought in about $24 billion in funding this year through August, according to PitchBook data.Despite Nvidia's dominance in AI computing, the company does not have an unassailable lock on the sector. AMD plans to launch this year a chip that will compete with Nvidia's, and Intel leapfrogged development by gaining a rival product in an acquisition. Sources see these as having long-term potential to become alternatives to Nvidia's chip.There are also adjacent applications that could provide openings for competitors. For example, chips that perform data-intensive computing for prediction algorithms are an emerging niche. Nvidia does not dominate this area and it's ripe for investment.(Reporting by Max A.

It marked the biggest back-to-back slide in 10 months.The culprit as you may know by now: Chinese officials are reportedly asking government employees to stop using iPhones.Considering Apple does big business in China, it's not a total shocker this headline would take a bite out of the stock. Who is to say China doesn't order a shutdown of Apple stores to send a message to the West? We don't know, and that's why Apple's stock has gotten hit.But interestingly, while Apple's stock has come under selling pressure, the broader tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has not. Over the last five trading sessions, the Nasdaq is only down 1.9% compared to Apple's nearly 6% slide.Why? It's the sunnier side of the tech trade, in that the 10-year yield has stopped its meteoric ascent as it appears the Fed will pause on rate hikes at its meeting later this month.That has made investors tepid to dump tech names, which normally don't act well when rates are on the rise.""I think we went through a process of investors absorbing higher rates for longer at the end of last year and the first half of this year, and you saw a very aggressive reset of valuations and technology in the second half of 2022,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan explained to me at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Tech Conference last week.""We think that reset has mostly happened at this point unless there is a chance that 5% rates, plus or minus, are going to be the new normal,"" Sheridan added. ""If we end up with higher rates than that, we'll have to go through another valuation reset, probably for the broader group. But our house view ... would be the recession probability is coming down and the Fed is unlikely to raise rates anytime soon in the next couple of meetings.""Story continuesI certainly saw the appetite to own top tech names at the Goldman conference in packed conference rooms for presentations by Nvidia, AMD, and countless others. Not one person I talked with called out Apple/China risk as weighing heavily on their decision-making process on tech stocks.What they did call out was, to Sheridan's point, a cooling in yields opening up some entry points into fundamentally strong names.Not to dismiss the buzzy Apple/China news, but there is a sunnier side to tech — as is often the case in life.morning brief imageBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

In addition, they have experienced significant improvements in net profit margins. They have been delivering strong results in all of their regional segments through increased pricing and volumes.Recently, they have completed the financial closing of the world’s largest green hydrogen production plant in partnership with ACWA Power and NEOM. This plant will produce green hydrogen in the form of green ammonia and Air Products will be the sole purchaser of all production. This makes it one of those hydrogen stocks to watch.They have also signed a $1 billion investment agreement with the Republic of Uzbekistan and Uzbekneftegaz JSC to acquire and operate a gas-to-syngas processing plant. In addition, they have announced new projects related to liquefied natural gas technology and equipment and have expanded their LNG equipment manufacturing capacity.Story continuesAir Products continues to support the decarbonization of heavy-duty trucking and has made investments in hydrogen supply and technology in North America and Europe.Plug Power (PLUG)Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is another leader in integrated hydrogen solutions. They have reported second-quarter results, where their adjusted loss per share was larger than expected. However, they have experienced a significant increase in revenues, with a 72% increase compared to the previous year.They have secured an order for 100 megawatts of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, which will be powered by 100% renewable energy. These electrolyzers will generate green hydrogen to replace gray hydrogen in the oil refining process. This transition will allow a reduction of approximately 516 tons of CO2 per day. All in all, PLUG is one of those hydrogen stocks to watch.The company has also signed an agreement with Blue EnerFreeze, a subsidiary of STEF, the European market leader in the transport and logistics of food products. This agreement involves the implementation of a complete green hydrogen ecosystem at two distribution centers, with the possibility of expansion to more than 100 additional sites.Plug Power’s hydrogen fuel cell technology is ideally suited to cold storage environments, offering superior performance and increased productivity in demanding mobility applications.Linde (LIN)Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical companySource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.comLinde (NYSE:LIN) is one of the world’s largest industrial gas companies and hydrogen solutions providers. In the second quarter, sales were $8,204 million, down 3% from a year earlier but up 2% when excluding certain costs and currency fluctuations. Underlying sales were up 6% due to a 7% increase in prices, slightly offset by a 1% decrease in volumes.They have announced that they have signed two major agreements in Brazil for the supply of renewable energy. These agreements will enable Linde to secure more than two million megawatt-hours per year of renewable energy, replacing almost half of its current energy consumption in Brazil. This increase in renewable energy supply supports Linde’s emissions reduction targets and its ambition of climate neutrality by 2050.In addition to reducing their own emissions, they also seek to help their customers decarbonize their processes by using industrial gases with a lower carbon footprint. They estimate that their solutions, technologies, and services help avoid more than double the emissions generated by their own operations.They have also signed a long-term agreement with Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) for the use of carbon dioxide associated with Linde’s new clean hydrogen production in Beaumont, Texas. This agreement will allow Exxon Mobil to transport and permanently store up to 2.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, equivalent to the emissions from nearly half a million cars per year.That concludes our list of hydrogen stocks to watch.As of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Fox is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$2.7b ÷ (US$22b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Fox has an ROCE of 15%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Media industry average of 8.1% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Fox roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Fox compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Fox here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Fox, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 15% from 19% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom Line On Fox's ROCETo conclude, we've found that Fox is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 14% to shareholders over the last three years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Fox  that we think you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

It has risen more than 7% over the past two weeks as the rally in oil resumed earnestly from a fortnight break to a run-up that originally began in June. Year-to-date, Brent is up almost 6%.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled at $87.29 per barrel, up 22 cents, or 0.3%, on the day. WTI rose almost 10% over the past two weeks, reigniting an oil rally that began in June and which has put the U.S. crude benchmark up 9% on the year.Both Brent and WTI are trading near 10-month highs, boosted by talk of Saudi-Russian production cuts.“Oil prices have also been tearing higher again in recent weeks, aided by the Saudi/Russian decision to extend output restrictions until the end of the year,” observed Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Brent is now trading around $90 where it has stalled over the last week.”Monday’s lows in oil prices were limited by the notion that U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, will report ton Wednesday hat domestic crude and gasoline stockpiles had fallen last week for a fifth week in a row, as benign weather ahead of the approaching fall season on Sept. 23 encouraged Americans to continue road travels.Aside from the EIA report on Wednesday, those in the oil market also have to contend this week with supply-demand forecasts from the Vienna-based Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and the Paris-based International Energy Agency, or IEA.The OPEC report will particularly be scrutinized for forecasts on more supply tightness that could push crude prices even higher, though the IEA could balance some of that by pointing out the potential for higher inflation that could ultimately weigh on demand.Story continuesU.S. inflation data is another major markets event scheduled for Wednesday. The August reading for the Consumer Price Index, due on Wednesday, to show a year-on-year increase of 3.6%. In July, the so-called CPI had risen to 3.2% from a previous reading of 3% for June. Until then, inflation had been on a decline for most of the past year, after hitting a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022.High energy prices are one of the biggest drivers of inflation. If the CPI continues to rise, it could embolden the Federal Reserve to do more rate hikes than initially anticipated by economists.Brent's hold at above $90 comes with less than two weeks left for summer, the season Americans like driving the most. With the fall season of lower oil usage set to begin imminently, crude prices would typically retreat a little, sometimes meaningfully, in the world’s largest consuming country.But that may not happen this time, not with the Saudi obsession of ultimately getting oil to $100 a barrel or beyond. The Arabs, who control much of the world’s oil exports, have been fixated on triple digit pricing since losing that advantage in August 2022, when Brent crude hovered above $105.Key to this is the 1.0-million-barrels-per day in additional cuts, on top of other existing production rationing, that the Saudis have been carrying out since July. By extending this till the year-end — and widening it with the help of Moscow which will cut 300,000 barrels per day of Russian production — the kingdom is hoping to create a different sort of market phenomenon for pricing.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil down a touch as bulls defend $90 on optimism over U.S. stockpile drawsTreasury's Adeyemo calls for eliminating subsidies, including to energy companiesIsland states seek climate protection from Law of the Sea]"

The report is set to show headline inflation continues to reverse its downtrend as oil prices rise.On the corporate side, Apple (AAPL) is scheduled to host its marquee fall event on Tuesday, with new iPhones, Apple Watches, and a new charging port for most devices expected to be announced.A September 14 deadline also looms in a contract dispute between the United Auto Workers and automakers Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), with workers threatening a strike when their current deal expires on Thursday.Last week, markets continued choppy trading that began back in August as concerns over sticky price inflation from an August report on the services sector sent stocks lower on Wednesday, while a decline in tech stocks over fears regarding China's economy weighed on equity markets.The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) led the losses, falling near 2% during the holiday-shortened trading week. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.4%Inflation will be in focus this week with Wall Street expecting another uptick in headline inflation.Economists forecast headline inflation rose 3.6% over the prior year in August, an increase from the 3.2% rise seen in July. Prices are set to rise 0.6% on a monthly basis. An increase in energy prices is expected to drive much of the increase.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, CPI is forecast to rise 4.3% over last year in August, a slowdown from the 4.7% increase seen in July. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.2%.The Federal Reserve's closer focus on core inflation has economists and investors confident the central bank won't raise rates in September. As of Friday, markets had priced in a 92% chance the Fed holds interest rates steady at the conclusion of its September 19-20 meeting, according to data from the CME Group.Story continues""We do not expect that [CPI data] will tip the scales towards a hike, given the mixed message delivered by the other employment reports and last month's inflation data,"" Jefferies economist Thomas Simons wrote on Friday.Also out this week will be the August retail sales report, which will provide a look at how resilient US consumers remain after a strong summer. Economists expect retail sales increased 0.1% in August, a noted decrease from the 0.7% jump seen in July.Data on producer prices, a read on small business optimism, and the weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance will also feature on the economic calendar.iPhone debutApple's update of its signature product on Tuesday is expected to be a market moving event, and comes at a critical juncture for America's biggest public company.Apple stock slipped more than 6% in a two-day period last week after Chinese officials told employees at central government agencies to not use iPhones at work. A new high-end phone release from China's Huawei also added pressure on Apple.Some analysts, though, said the selloff was ""overblown.""But this trading hangs in the background of Apple's event, dubbed ""Wonderlust,"" which is expected to see its iPhone lineup refreshed, new Apple Watches revealed, and the introduction of USB-C charging ports across its device lineup, sunsetting the lightning charger currently powering most iPhones.""Historically, the iPhone launch has been a sell-the-news event,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a preview of the event.""While we don't expect the day-of stock reaction to the September 12th Wonderlust event to be any different this year, we continue to believe that FY24 iPhone expectations are too low and that the iPhone 15 cycle is not as 'iterative' as anticipated, with the potential for both unit and [average selling price] growth.""Customers experience Apple products at an Apple store in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan province, Sept 8, 2023.

Despite the possibility of more near-term uncertainty, volatility, and selling, the overall upbeat backdrop that drove much of the 2023 rally remains in place.Therefore, investors with long-term horizons might want to consider buying proven S&amp;P 500 stocks that are trading at levels that could look like steals years or even months from now. The three stocks we explore today are Starbucks, Paycom Software and Public Storage.The recent downturn in the early days of a traditionally poor month for stocks has seen the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq slide back below their 50-day moving averages. The bulls might have to hold their ground in the lead-up to the August CPI release on September 13. Yet, the nearby chart showcases how the Nasdaq is interacting with its 21-week moving average (red line) and why it might indicate more bullishness going forward.Now might be a time for investors to take a giant step back and remember to block out the constant noise and look to the two biggest drivers of stock prices: earnings and interest rates.Zacks estimates call for S&amp;P 500 earnings to soar 11.7% in 2024 and another 10.9% in 2025 vs. a projected decline of -3.2% in 2023. And Jay Powell and Co. remain near the end of their tightening cycle.Rates might have to stay higher for longer as the U.S. economy remains resilient. In fact, the higher rates signal ongoing strength and growth, which further supports the soft landing that more Wall Street giants are calling for.All told, it might be time for investors to take one of Warren Buffett’s most used mantras to heart and “be greedy when others are fearful” and start looking at large-cap S&amp;P 500 stocks that have fallen out of favor and are trading at levels that might look likes steals years from now.Story continuesStarbucks is the coffee shop powerhouse that boasts over 37,000 stores globally.

While the direct impact on Apple's sales will likely be minimal, the effects of this ban could reverberate and put a big chunk of Apple's China-derived revenue in jeopardy.

138,e67d9823-8681-3749-833d-3102a97633e0,MU,2023-09-11,Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) Is Carrying A Fair Bit Of Debt,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-nasdaq-mu-carrying-110117728.html,1694430077,STORY,['MU'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Micron Technology What Is Micron Technology's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2023 Micron Technology had US$11.9b of debt, an increase on US$6.03b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$10.4b in cash leading to net debt of about US$1.57b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Micron Technology's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Micron Technology had liabilities of US$5.10b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$15.2b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$10.4b in cash and US$2.43b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$7.49b.Given Micron Technology has a humongous market capitalization of US$76.9b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Micron Technology can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesIn the last year Micron Technology had a loss before interest and tax, and actually shrunk its revenue by 44%, to US$18b. That makes us nervous, to say the least.Caveat EmptorNot only did Micron Technology's revenue slip over the last twelve months, but it also produced negative earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). To be specific the EBIT loss came in at US$2.6b. When we look at that and recall the liabilities on its balance sheet, relative to cash, it seems unwise to us for the company to have any debt. So we think its balance sheet is a little strained, though not beyond repair. Another cause for caution is that is bled US$4.7b in negative free cash flow over the last twelve months. So in short it's a really risky stock. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Micron Technology , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on how valuable AI can prove to be in the financial and stock trading industry, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In According to AI.The abundance of posts claiming that ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot, has beaten the stock market highlights the significant variation in its responses based on input. It's important to appreciate and leverage the diverse possibilities AI offers. For instance, when Bloomberg asked ChatGPT to create an ETF to outperform the US stock market, it simply reiterated the standard disclaimer that past performance doesn't guarantee future results and that beating the market due to its high volatility is improbable.However, experts have managed to coax ChatGPT into providing lists of stocks by posing as expert stock advisors. Investors have explored using AI to gain an edge in the market, with some researchers claiming high success rates for short-term predictions using machine learning models based on trading data. A group of stocks chosen by ChatGPT has shown significantly better performance than some of the most popular investment funds in the UK.Finder.com, a financial comparison site, tasked ChatGPT with constructing a stock portfolio aimed at surpassing some of the United Kingdom's most favored funds, including Fundsmith, Vanguard LifeStrategy 100% Equity A Acc, Vanguard LifeStrategy 80% Equity A Acc, and Vanguard FTSE Glb All Cp Idx £ Acc, among others. Over an eight-week period, the ChatGPT-generated portfolio of 38 stocks gained 4.9% during the initial 11 weeks since its creation on March 6, 2023, while ten leading investment funds in the UK experienced an average loss of 0.8%, according to CNN. This performance notably outpaced the performance of the top 10 most popular UK funds, which experienced a decline of 0.12% over the same period. For the purposes of this article, we have chosen 12 stocks from ChatGPT's portfolio that garnered the highest interest from hedge fund investors.Story continuesAI's influence on stock markets has become substantial, leading to comparisons with the surges witnessed in cryptocurrency and the dot-com era. Companies increasingly use buzzwords like ""generative AI,"" ""large language models,"" and ""artificial intelligence"" during earnings calls and meetings, resulting in a substantial 85% increase in the use of the term ""artificial intelligence"" during such events. This heightened focus on AI often drives up stock prices when companies announce plans to integrate AI into their operations, even among non-tech firms like Wendy's, which experienced stock price gains after revealing AI-driven cost-cutting plans.Although traditional investment funds have been using AI for years, ChatGPT makes this technology accessible to the general public, potentially influencing retail investors' decisions. A survey by Finder.com found that 8% of UK adults had already used ChatGPT for financial advice, and 19% were considering doing so.However, 35% of respondents indicated that they would not consider using the chatbot for financial decisions. Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and the president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth, explains to CNBC Make It that ChatGPT is certainly not a tool that can help you outperform the stock market in any way. While AI can process vast amounts of data and make some accurate stock picks, its long-term performance remains uncertain. Additionally, the limitations of AI, such as outdated knowledge and an inability to understand individual preferences, make it unsuitable for replacing human financial advisors.Despite its potential, experts advise caution and recommend conducting individual research or consulting a qualified financial adviser when making investment decisions, as it may be too early to fully trust AI with financial matters. Instead, ChatGPT and similar AI tools can be valuable for looking up financial terms and gathering data during research. For emotionally-driven financial decisions or those involving personal preferences, human financial advisors are better equipped to provide tailored guidance and empathetic support, areas where AI currently falls short. Nonetheless, the democratization of AI is seen as a disruptive force in the financial industry.The current market performance and the hype created by AI technology can be a motivator for investors to consider the best investments according to AI. Ergo, investors looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in these stocks can check our list, which includes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).Our MethodologyWe selected the best stocks to invest in according to AI based consensus picks from credible sources.

The company also provides production and reservoir chemicals, along with highly engineered equipment and technologies, such as artificial lift and drill bit inserts, for the oil and gas industry. Notably, ChampionX has a global footprint and favorable product mix, where its chemicals and artificial lift businesses are tied to the production phase of the life of a well. We believe this produces lower earnings variability and potentially stronger operating results. Shares outperformed during the quarter as the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results and gave better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Moreover, the company expanded its capital return program by committing to return 60% of its free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks. Management also raised its share buyback authorization program from $250m to $750m over next 2 to 3 years. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong revenue growth, driven by their production focused Performance Chemicals business, which may lead to margin improvement and FCF generation.”11.

On top of this, CME also owns other key assets related to foreign exchange trading &amp; infrastructure and a strategic shareholding in Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) Index business.The key driver of trading activity for CME is in its interest rate derivatives products, where it has an effective monopoly in the exchange trading of interest rate derivatives in the United States, through its benchmark products across the entirety of the interest rate curve. Demand for interest rate derivatives is driven by volatility in interest rate markets, whose effect is compounded by the number of bonds held by those looking to manage interest rate risk and, by extension, market liquidity. The below chart of average daily volumes of interest rate derivatives and US Federal debt held by the public illustrates the extremely strong relationship between the size of the US Treasury market and volumes growth, although there are deviations around this primarily around Fed intervention (for example, at the start of the pandemic, volumes were suppressed by an enormous amount of Quantitative Easing (QE) and effectively zero interest rates which reduced the demand for hedging products). We expect the growth in the size of the US Treasury market, particularly in relation to privately held US treasuries as the Fed undergoes a balance sheet unwind, to remain a powerful underpinning of CME’s interest rate derivatives business…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

If you want to skip our introduction to dividends and the general economic climate, then check out S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Top 5 Stocks Sorted By Analyst Ratings. Dividends are one of the most stable ways that you can make money from the stock market. While most attention is often focused on stock share price appreciations and the potential to cash in at the right time, dividends mostly stay in the background. However, they provide investors the option to earn bond like payments for their stock ownership. Dividends are generally paid by larger and established companies with budgets that are capable of supporting investing in growth or by others that are structured to pay out most of their earnings from investment or other entities as dividends.Since there are thousands of stocks on the market, picking out only those that have consistently paid dividends for decades despite the prevailing economic environment is quite difficult. This becomes ever more important given the current economic environment. Inflation and the stock market have roiled decision making and created a tough environment for those that seek stability. Meteoric gains made by the big technology and mega-cap firms almost seemed to reverse and start a downward trend in August, and economists and analysts as a whole are now starting to favor a cautious approach towards the stock market. The simple reason behind this is that the rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to curtail historic inflation are historic themselves. The bank rate in the U.S. is now at a two decade high, and the fact that the economy has managed to weather the storm so far has surprised a lot of professionals.Dividends can prove to be crucial if they can provide stable income in a tough environment. At the same time, reinvesting dividends into the stock that pays it (after consulting certified professionals) can also enable one to grow wealth over the decades and have a nice nest egg waiting for retirement. There are multiple lists that track dividend companies, and one of the more popular ones is the S&amp;P500 Dividend Aristocrats. The list sets a rather high bar for entry, since not only does it include only those stocks that are part of the S&amp;P 500 index, but further narrows down the selection criteria to include only those firms that have grown their dividends consecutively for the past 25 years. The total returns of these stocks are naturally higher than the S&amp;P500, and except for some rare exceptions, lead and lag the index during periods of upturns and downturns, respectively.Story continuesNearly half of the S&amp;P500 Dividend Aristocrats are firms operating in the consumer staples and industrial sectors. This is unsurprising since these firms are either less prone to the negative effects of economic shocks or are large and established companies that generate stable revenue simply due to their scale and expensive long term capital investments. We've covered this elite list of stocks quite frequently as well. Check out 25 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid, Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 15 According to Analysts, and S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund Popularity.This time around, we'll look at the dividend aristocrats with the best analyst ratings and some notable stocks are Linde plc (NYSE:LIN), Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:RHI)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-robert-125431229.html,1694350471,STORY,['RHI'],"[Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI), might not be a large cap stock, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$84.56 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$69.61. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Robert Half's current trading price of US$73.20 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Robert Half’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Robert Half What's The Opportunity In Robert Half?Great news for investors – Robert Half is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 14.22x is currently well-below the industry average of 22.33x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Robert Half’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Robert Half?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Robert Half's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since RHI is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on RHI for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy RHI. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed assessment.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

144,94d85059-9448-3d58-b898-6493fa9df434,TSCO,2023-09-11,A Look At The Fair Value Of Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-tractor-supply-134253342.html,1694353373.0,STORY,['TSCO'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Tractor Supply is US$229 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$217 suggests Tractor Supply is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 6.5% lower than Tractor Supply's analyst price target of US$245How far off is Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Tractor Supply Is Tractor Supply Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$856.3mUS$1.17bUS$1.27bUS$1.36bUS$1.42bUS$1.48bUS$1.53bUS$1.58bUS$1.62bUS$1.67bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.90%Est @ 4.07%Est @ 3.50%Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.81%Est @ 2.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$797US$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$992US$961US$926US$888US$850US$812(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.3bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$32bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$32b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$16bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$25b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$217, the company appears about fair value at a 5.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tractor Supply as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.060. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Tractor SupplyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Tractor Supply, there are three further items you should look at:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Tractor Supply .Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for TSCO's future outlook?

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International Mondelez International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Maurizio Brusadelli, for US$1.4m worth of shares, at about US$66.68 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$69.82, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 9.2% of Maurizio Brusadelli's holding. Maurizio Brusadelli was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.Maurizio Brusadelli sold a total of 38.26k shares over the year at an average price of US$67.08. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Mondelez International better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of Mondelez InternationalLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Mondelez International insiders own about US$135m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Mondelez International Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Mondelez International insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Mondelez International insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Mondelez International and we suggest you have a look.Of course Mondelez International may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on how valuable AI can prove to be in the financial and stock trading industry, head directly to 5 Best Stocks To Invest In According to AI.The abundance of posts claiming that ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot, has beaten the stock market highlights the significant variation in its responses based on input. It's important to appreciate and leverage the diverse possibilities AI offers. For instance, when Bloomberg asked ChatGPT to create an ETF to outperform the US stock market, it simply reiterated the standard disclaimer that past performance doesn't guarantee future results and that beating the market due to its high volatility is improbable.However, experts have managed to coax ChatGPT into providing lists of stocks by posing as expert stock advisors. Investors have explored using AI to gain an edge in the market, with some researchers claiming high success rates for short-term predictions using machine learning models based on trading data. A group of stocks chosen by ChatGPT has shown significantly better performance than some of the most popular investment funds in the UK.Finder.com, a financial comparison site, tasked ChatGPT with constructing a stock portfolio aimed at surpassing some of the United Kingdom's most favored funds, including Fundsmith, Vanguard LifeStrategy 100% Equity A Acc, Vanguard LifeStrategy 80% Equity A Acc, and Vanguard FTSE Glb All Cp Idx £ Acc, among others. Over an eight-week period, the ChatGPT-generated portfolio of 38 stocks gained 4.9% during the initial 11 weeks since its creation on March 6, 2023, while ten leading investment funds in the UK experienced an average loss of 0.8%, according to CNN. This performance notably outpaced the performance of the top 10 most popular UK funds, which experienced a decline of 0.12% over the same period. For the purposes of this article, we have chosen 12 stocks from ChatGPT's portfolio that garnered the highest interest from hedge fund investors.Story continuesAI's influence on stock markets has become substantial, leading to comparisons with the surges witnessed in cryptocurrency and the dot-com era. Companies increasingly use buzzwords like ""generative AI,"" ""large language models,"" and ""artificial intelligence"" during earnings calls and meetings, resulting in a substantial 85% increase in the use of the term ""artificial intelligence"" during such events. This heightened focus on AI often drives up stock prices when companies announce plans to integrate AI into their operations, even among non-tech firms like Wendy's, which experienced stock price gains after revealing AI-driven cost-cutting plans.Although traditional investment funds have been using AI for years, ChatGPT makes this technology accessible to the general public, potentially influencing retail investors' decisions. A survey by Finder.com found that 8% of UK adults had already used ChatGPT for financial advice, and 19% were considering doing so.However, 35% of respondents indicated that they would not consider using the chatbot for financial decisions. Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and the president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth, explains to CNBC Make It that ChatGPT is certainly not a tool that can help you outperform the stock market in any way. While AI can process vast amounts of data and make some accurate stock picks, its long-term performance remains uncertain. Additionally, the limitations of AI, such as outdated knowledge and an inability to understand individual preferences, make it unsuitable for replacing human financial advisors.Despite its potential, experts advise caution and recommend conducting individual research or consulting a qualified financial adviser when making investment decisions, as it may be too early to fully trust AI with financial matters. Instead, ChatGPT and similar AI tools can be valuable for looking up financial terms and gathering data during research. For emotionally-driven financial decisions or those involving personal preferences, human financial advisors are better equipped to provide tailored guidance and empathetic support, areas where AI currently falls short. Nonetheless, the democratization of AI is seen as a disruptive force in the financial industry.The current market performance and the hype created by AI technology can be a motivator for investors to consider the best investments according to AI. Ergo, investors looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in these stocks can check our list, which includes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).Our MethodologyWe selected the best stocks to invest in according to AI based consensus picks from credible sources.

Notably, ChampionX has a global footprint and favorable product mix, where its chemicals and artificial lift businesses are tied to the production phase of the life of a well. We believe this produces lower earnings variability and potentially stronger operating results. Shares outperformed during the quarter as the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results and gave better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Moreover, the company expanded its capital return program by committing to return 60% of its free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks. Management also raised its share buyback authorization program from $250m to $750m over next 2 to 3 years.

On top of this, CME also owns other key assets related to foreign exchange trading &amp; infrastructure and a strategic shareholding in Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) Index business.The key driver of trading activity for CME is in its interest rate derivatives products, where it has an effective monopoly in the exchange trading of interest rate derivatives in the United States, through its benchmark products across the entirety of the interest rate curve. Demand for interest rate derivatives is driven by volatility in interest rate markets, whose effect is compounded by the number of bonds held by those looking to manage interest rate risk and, by extension, market liquidity. The below chart of average daily volumes of interest rate derivatives and US Federal debt held by the public illustrates the extremely strong relationship between the size of the US Treasury market and volumes growth, although there are deviations around this primarily around Fed intervention (for example, at the start of the pandemic, volumes were suppressed by an enormous amount of Quantitative Easing (QE) and effectively zero interest rates which reduced the demand for hedging products). We expect the growth in the size of the US Treasury market, particularly in relation to privately held US treasuries as the Fed undergoes a balance sheet unwind, to remain a powerful underpinning of CME’s interest rate derivatives business…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Intuit can appeal the judge’s ruling to the FTC’s commissioners.Intuit “advertised to consumers that they could file their taxes online for free using TurboTax, when in truth, for approximately two-thirds of taxpayers, the advertised claim was false,” Chappell wrote.He ordered the company to stop advertising that its products were free and include “clear and conspicuous” disclosures about when consumers are eligible for free tax-filing services.Intuit said it will appeal the decision, calling the process “flawed and highly questionable,” in a blog post last week. The company said it already adheres to “most of the advertising practices” in the decision, and expects no significant impact to the business.About 46% of taxpayers filed with do-it-yourself tools such as TurboTax in 2022, up from 35% a decade earlier, according to Wells Fargo &amp; Co. analysts.Intuit previously settled with state regulators over allegations it tried to upsell people who qualified for a federal free filing program. As part of that settlement, the company agreed to government monitoring for half a decade, to pay $141 million in fines and to be more clear in its web design and advertisements about which services are free.But Intuit has fought the FTC’s case because the agency is seeking further restrictions on its business practices.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekADHD Drug Shortages Worsen as Makers Say Production Is Maxed OutJames Dolan’s $2.3 Billion Sphere Is Raising Eyebrows—in a Good WayInvestors Stand by Israel’s Tech Startups, for NowGoodbye, California.

After putting in a bottom earlier this year, and more recently breaking above a major level of resistance, the trend is clearly pointing higher.The energy sector has led the market over the last week, month and three months, indicating considerable relative strength.Higher oil prices mean more profit for oil and energy adjacent companies. Enerplus, Valero Energy and Parr Pacific are three stocks that are likely to benefit from higher oil prices. Furthermore, each of these stocks enjoys reasonable valuations, and extremely compelling technical chart setups.EnerplusEnerplus Corporation is a Canadian energy company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas resources. With a diversified portfolio of assets across North America, Enerplus focuses on optimizing production and capitalizing on growth opportunities in both conventional and unconventional resource plays. The company's strategic approach, combined with its commitment to operational efficiency and sustainability, positions it as a significant player in the energy sector, poised to leverage evolving market dynamics.Enerplus has recently seen some significant increases in its earnings estimates, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 33% over the last month, while FY23 estimates have been boosted by 11%.Last week, Enerplus broke out from a standard bull flag following another leg higher in the price of oil. Then on Thursday’s trading, the price retested the breakout level and reversed hard. This is very bullish price action and provides a very asymmetric trading opportunity.Story continuesIf ERF stock trades above $17.50, which is Thursday’s high, the next leg higher should begin. However, if it trades below the $17 level, investors may want to steer clear as the setup will be invalidated.Enerplus is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 7.7x, which is below the industry average of 10.4x, and below its 10-year median of 9.2x. Furthermore, the company pays a dividend yield of 1.4%.Valero EnergyValero Energy is one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and marketers in the United States. Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, Valero operates several refineries across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean. The company produces a variety of products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, distillates, jet fuel, asphalt, petrochemicals, and more. Apart from refining operations, Valero also has a significant presence in the ethanol industry.VLO today has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, but its style scores indicate that improvements may be just around the corner. The stock boasts an ‘A’ grade across the Value, Growth, Momentum and VGM style scores. Furthermore, EPS are forecast to grow by 6% annually over the next 3-5 years.Like the others, Valero Energy stock has been building a compelling technical chart pattern. Just this week, VLO stock cleared the $134.70 level, signaling a breakout. So long as the stock doesn’t reverse back below that level, it should continue to rally significantly.Par PacificPar Pacific manages and maintains interests in energy and infrastructure businesses. The company's operating segment consists of refining, retail and logistics. It also markets and distributes crude oil from the Western United States and Canada to refining hubs in the Midwest, Gulf Coast, East Coast and to Hawaii. Par Pacific Holdings, Inc., formerly known as Par Petroleum Corporation, is headquartered in Houston, Texas.Although PARR currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, the company’s quarterly earninga shows above expected performance. At the most recent quarterly meeting Parr Pacific reported EPS of $1.73 per share, which was 44% above analysts' expectations.But what really drew me to PARR stock is the picture-perfect technical pattern. Parr Pacific stock has formed an extremely tight bull flag from which the price looks like it is about to launch higher from. If the stock can break out above the $36.30 level, it should push to another new all-time high. Alternatively, if it loses the level of support, and trades below $34.30, the setup is invalid, and investors should look for other opportunities.Bottom LineIt looks like the energy market may be in the midst of another major bull run, and thus investors should consider reloading their portfolios with oil and gas stocks. Of course, even the best trading setups can fail, so investors should always keep risk management front of mind and stick to a trading plan.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

154,710aed76-6d43-3947-9481-62646d66d73e,VLO,2023-09-11,7 Stocks to Buy to Profit from a Flat Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-profit-flat-171557284.html,1693847757,STORY,"['VLO', 'SWKS', 'TMUS', 'WMT', 'WTRG', 'DFS', 'GT']","[While the equities sector might not collapse (a la the Great Recession), it might not offer a decisively directional motion, which augurs well for stocks to buy for a flat market. Generally, investors have two choices: buy enterprises that may enjoy greater success, or short companies that may fail eventually.But what do you do when the market runs neither hot or cold? In that case, you’re going to want to direct your stocks to buy on businesses that benefit from consistent demand. Most of these names hardly warrant the description “sexy.” Rather, they’re boring “AF” as the kids like to say. However, these flat market stock picks may protect your wealth during ambiguous cycles.After such an extraordinary run following the Covid-19 crisis, it just might be time for a cooling off. Assuming that Wall Street doesn’t fall off a cliff, these are the stocks to buy ahead of a non-committal market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGoodyear Tire (GT)Sign for Goodyear (GT) tire shop. The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company is an American tire manufacturing company.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comWhen discussing boring enterprises, I’m not sure it gets much more snooze-inducing than Goodyear Tire (NASDAQ:GT). To be clear, Goodyear is a critical business, providing high-quality tires for various vehicle classes. However, neither the average consumer nor investor gets up in the morning excited about vulcanization. Nevertheless, as an idea for stocks to buy, GT could be intriguing.According to data from S&amp;P Global Mobility, the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways reached 12.5 years, a dubious record. Basically, this framework tells us that people are not out buying new replacement vehicles. Instead, they’re making their dollars stretch by staying with their current vehicles until they can’t run anymore.That might lift GT because a fresh set of tires is a lot cheaper than buying a new or used car. Plus, it’s an unavoidable expense. To be fair, GT – while being a consensus moderate buy among analysts – may only rise modestly. Still, that’s a lot better than incurring a loss.Story continuesSkyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comWhile technology firms may not see much inclusion as flat market stock picks (due to their volatility risk), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) might be worth investigating. Focusing on high-performance analog semiconductors, Skyworks empowers the wireless networking revolution, per its website. Also, the company commands 4,600 patents and over 6,000 customers. In addition, it claims positive environmental impacts, improving energy and water efficiency by over 20%.Given the wide relevancies of the business, it’s not surprising that Skyworks offers a compelling financial profile. Specifically, its three-year revenue growth (per-share basis) hits 20.2%, above 69.4% of its peers. As well, its consistently profitable, printing a trailing-year net margin of 20.97%.Over the trailing one-year period, SWKS gained over 11% of equity value. However, there could be more gains on tap given that it’s undervalued, trading at a forward multiple of only 11.99x. Lastly, while SWKS carries a moderate buy consensus view among analysts, its $118.27 price target implies less than 8% upside. However, it also carries a forward yield of 2.48%, a factor that should be considered.Walmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the world’s most famous big-box retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) fits into many narratives. Unsurprisingly, it’s a great candidate for stocks to buy for a flat market. Thanks to its business innovations like everyday low pricing, Walmart offers tremendous relevance no matter what the market cycle. However, if the economy continues to trudge along horizontally, WMT could be an enticing idea to enliven your portfolio.While it’s not the sexiest idea out there, Walmart delivers demand predictability. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate at 7% ranks better than 58.68% of its peers. That’s not remarkable but it’s solid. Also, the company benefits from consistently profitability. Notably, its return on equity (ROE) comes in at 18.55%, above the sector median of 8.65%.As for passive income, Walmart isn’t generous, featuring a forward yield of only 1.41%. However, the company does command 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. Also, it’s a consensus strong buy among analysts, who anticipate shares hitting $178.32 or more than 10% higher.Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comA downstream petroleum company, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on the manufacturing and marketing of transportation fuels, other petrochemical products and power. Since the start of the year, VLO gained over 11% of equity value. However, in the trailing month ended Sept. 1, VLO gained nearly 6%. With a combination of geopolitics and tightening hydrocarbon supplies, VLO could rise higher.That might be the case even if the rest of the market goes sideways. Unlike a purely discretionary enterprise, Valero aligns with a wider necessity. Sure, some folks are pivoting toward electric vehicles. But the vast majority of drivers in the U.S. drive combustion vehicles. Given the troubling consumer economic headwinds, relatively few can comfortably afford the EV transition. Thus, VLO represents a cynical idea for stocks to buy for a flat market.Notably, VLO carries a forward yield of 3.05%. Moreover, analysts peg VLO a moderate buy with a $149.09 price target, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Discover Financial (DFS)the Discover (DFS) logo displayed outdoorsSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American financial services company, Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) might be best known for owning and operating Discover Bank, an online financial institution. Along with providing checking and savings accounts along with various lending programs, the bank also provides credit cards. Cynically, this business may empower DFS as one of the stocks to buy for a flat market. It’s also controversial and risky.As you’ve probably heard by now, Americans’ credit card debt exceeded $1 trillion, a dubious record in my opinion. Some like Bloomberg might interpret this as a sign of strength. However, a good portion of this debt load centers on households not being able to make ends meet otherwise. On one hand, companies like Discover can help keep folks afloat. But on the other hand, it may seem like preying on misfortune.Of course, the risk is sustainability. If people can’t pay their bills, Discover may have to eat the bad debt. Still, analysts are willing to give it a shot, pegging DFS a buy with a $113.53 price target. This forecast implies over 23% upside potential.T-Mobile (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: ShutterstockAs a wireless network operator, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an intriguing idea for flat market stock picks due to its pertinence. Many years ago, cellphones were basically toys for the rich. Today, it’s almost impossible to live without a smart device. Further, as a viable competitor to the top wireless enterprises, T-Mobile provides a much-needed consumer alternative.Another reason why TMUS could be one of the stocks to buy centers on its penchant for share repurchases. As a Motley Fool article argued recently, share repurchases can be a more tax-efficient way for returning excess cash to shareholders. This thesis seems to carry a significant ring of truth.In the trailing one-year period, TMUS lost a bit more than 3%. In sharp contrast, VZ stumbled almost 16% during the same period. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg TMUS as a consensus strong buy. Among 13 experts, the worst individual rating is a hold. Also, the average price target comes in at $179.46, implying nearly 31% upside.Essential Utilities (WTRG)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comA proposition for stocks to buy reserved only for speculators, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) may be pertinent, but it’s also risky. Since the beginning of this year, WTRG gave up nearly 24% of its equity value. What raises eyebrows is that during the past five years, WTRG lost about 2%. That’s not exactly the way to endear prospective investors.At the same time, utility firms like Essential benefit from a natural monopoly. Basically, the barriers to entry for the underlying industry is so steep that would -be competitors don’t even bother. Also, Essential truly lives up to its name thanks to its ultra-critical drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. On the passive income front, the company carries a forward yield of 3.35%, which is pretty decent. Also, it commands 32 years of consecutive dividend increases. On a final note, analysts peg WTRG a consensus moderate buy. The average price target stands at $54, implying over 47% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:EL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-est-e-110106628.html,1694430066,STORY,['EL'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Estée Lauder Companies is US$188 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$154 suggests Estée Lauder Companies is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is similar to Estée Lauder Companies' analyst price target of US$189Does the September share price for The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.46bUS$2.10bUS$2.82bUS$2.95bUS$3.52bUS$3.92bUS$4.26bUS$4.55bUS$4.79bUS$5.00bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x10Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 11.48%Est @ 8.68%Est @ 6.72%Est @ 5.35%Est @ 4.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$1.4kUS$1.8kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.2%) = US$93bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$93b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$45bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$67b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$154, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Estée Lauder Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.096. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Estée Lauder CompaniesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Personal Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Estée Lauder Companies, we've put together three essential factors you should look at:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 4 warning signs for Estée Lauder Companies (2 are potentially serious!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does EL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NASDAQ:ADP). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Automatic Data Processing’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing What Is Automatic Data Processing Worth?Great news for investors – Automatic Data Processing is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $356.05, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Automatic Data Processing’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What does the future of Automatic Data Processing look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Automatic Data Processing's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 31%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ADP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADP for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ADP. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Automatic Data Processing mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

(NASDAQ:ORLY) At US$958?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-oreilly-automotive-inc-nasdaq-100852934.html,1694426932,STORY,['ORLY'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY). The company's stock maintained its current share price over the past couple of month on the NASDAQGS, with a relatively tight range of US$883 to US$969. However, does this price actually reflect the true value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at O'Reilly Automotive’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive What Is O'Reilly Automotive Worth?According to my valuation model, O'Reilly Automotive seems to be fairly priced at around 11.65% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy O'Reilly Automotive today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $858.39, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Furthermore, O'Reilly Automotive’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.Can we expect growth from O'Reilly Automotive?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. O'Reilly Automotive's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ORLY’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ORLY, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

(NASDAQ:PEP) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 74%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-favorite-110124881.html,1694430084,STORY,['PEP'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in PepsiCo implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessA look at the shareholders of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 74% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PepsiCo. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PepsiCo?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that PepsiCo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PepsiCo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. PepsiCo is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. With 8.0% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that PepsiCo, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$323m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand PepsiCo better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - PepsiCo has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(AP) — Federal inspectors said they found an alarming number of defects in the locomotives and railcars Union Pacific was using at the world's largest railyard in western Nebraska this summer, and the railroad was reluctant to fix the problems.Federal Railroad Administrator Amit Bose wrote a letter to UP's top three executives Friday expressing his concern that the defects represent a “significant risk to rail safety "" on the Union Pacific railroad.Bose said the 19.93% defect rate on rail cars and the 72.69% rate for locomotives that inspectors found in July and August are both twice the national average. But the letter didn't detail what kind of defects inspectors found in the Bailey Yard in North Platte, and there are a myriad of federal rules.“The compliance of the rolling stock (freight cars and locomotives) on the UP network is poor, and UP was unwilling or unable to take steps to improve the condition of their equipment,” Bose said in his letter.Bose questioned whether the recent layoffs of 94 locomotive craft employees and 44 carmen across the Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad that is one of the nation's largest left UP without enough people to complete the necessary repairs.Kristen South, a spokeswoman for Union Pacific, said Sunday that the layoffs weren't a problem, and the railroad remains committed to safety.“Union Pacific will never compromise on the safety of our employees. Safety is always our first priority, and we are reviewing and will address the concerns raised by the FRA,” South said.Railroad safety has been a key concern nationwide this year ever since another railroad, Norfolk Southern, had a train derail and catch fire in eastern Ohio in February. That East Palestine derailment prompted regulators and members of Congress to call for reforms, but few significant changes have been made since then.South said the railroad has appropriate staffing levels with enough capacity to have “a buffer to allow for the natural ebb and flow nature of our business.”Those layoffs that UP announced late last month came after the FRA wrapped up its inspection, and they represent a tiny fraction of the railroad's workforce that numbers more than 30,000.Union Pacific's new CEO Jim Vena just took over the top spot at the railroad last month. Union Pacific has a network of 32,400 miles (52,000 kilometers) of track in 23 Western states.]"

(NYSE:GPS) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Gap’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Gap What Is Gap Worth?Gap is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 38.6x is currently well-above the industry average of 11.55x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Gap’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Gap generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Gap's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in GPS’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe GPS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on GPS for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for GPS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Gap at this point in time.
