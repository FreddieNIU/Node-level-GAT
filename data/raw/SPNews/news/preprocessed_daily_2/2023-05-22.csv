While they will not be able to control how votes are cast on individual directors or other specific ballot items, the guidance broadens an earlier effort State Street created to give institutional investors more say.Other big index fund providers BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group are also moving to give their clients more control, though not yet to as many individual investors.Together the three firms manage some $20 trillion. Their influential votes have drawn much criticism, both from activists urging them to push portfolio companies harder on issues such as climate change or workforce diversity and, this year, from right-wing U.S. politicians who say the firms focus too much on ESG matters.Giving away voting rights could blunt the criticism and distinguish State Street products. Voting choices will be ""yet another innovation that amplifies our ongoing mission to democratize investing,"" said Yie-Hsin Hung, CEO of State Street Global Advisors.State Street aims to offer individual voting for funds including the SPDR S&amp;P Dividend ETF, and targets November for certain products.Investors in funds including one of the firm's best-known, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, will not have access to the voting option because of their unit investment trust structure, a State Street representative said.

4,92e5985c-f528-3ebb-8be6-cdc2a2b6b572,STT,2023-05-22,7 Bank Stocks That Desperately Need Warren Buffett’s Help,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-bank-stocks-desperately-warren-113001034.html,1684409401,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB', 'BRK-A', 'ALLY', 'GS', 'SCHW', 'PNC', 'BRK-B', 'TFC', 'CMA', 'STT']","[As the banking crisis persists, bank stocks continue to trade at depressed prices. With this, many investors are waiting for Warren Buffett to step in and save the day.In recent years, Buffett has lowered Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) exposure to the sector.However, investors are hoping Buffett could potentially increase Berkshire’s banking stock exposure once again. These hopes are largely based on Berkshire’s large purchases of preferred shares in Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in past financial crises.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmong scores of hard-hit large and regional bank stocks, here are seven that Buffett may ultimately lend a helping hand.Ally Financial (ALLY)ally financial office building stocks to buySource: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to Warren Buffett and big banking stock investments, Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) is likely a name that comes to mind. Berkshire owns around 10% of this automotive-focused bank. There have also been rumors that Buffett’s firm would acquire this financial institution outright.As InvestorPlace analyst Louis Navellier has argued, there is plenty of evidence that suggests Berkshire isn’t interested in making this bank a wholly owned subsidiary. Still, if the auto loan crisis worsens, it’s easy to see Buffett stepping in and making another ALLY stock investment. Just not in the common shares.If a true crisis with Ally emerges, I can see Berkshire making a big preferred stock investment in Ally, on very favorable terms (high coupon rate on the preferred stock with warrants thrown in as part of the deal). That said, as a worsening crisis will undoubtedly send ALLY sinking, follow Navellier’s lead and stay away.Comerica (CMA)A sign for Comerica (CMA) bank in California. Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comWhile Ally is still far from crisis mode, one can argue that Comerica (NYSE:CMA) is much closer to reaching that point. This regional bank’s shares have dropped by more than 50% since the banking crisis first took shape in early March.Story continuesCMA stock has continued to drift lower as concerns over deposit declines and unrealized loan losses outweigh positives such a revenue and earnings beat for the preceding quarter. Comerica is one of several large and mid-sized regional banks that ratings firm Moody’s downgraded last month.These institutions are especially vulnerable, as the commercial real estate crisis could worsen their situations further. If Comerica turns into a situation akin to PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), the bank could end up going hat in hand to deep-pocketed investors.PNC Financial (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comOperating across 27 U.S. states, PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) is what’s known as a super regional bank. Too small to be a big bank, yet at the same time too large compared to other regional banking names.Still, that hasn’t stopped PNC stock from falling out of favor. Shares have tumbled by more than 28% since March. However, it is possible that the market has overreacted with its derating of PNC. As InvestorPlace Markets Analyst Thomas Yeung argued earlier this month, the bank’s national footprint may lower the chances it becomes the next First Republic (OTCMKTS:FRCB).Hence, shares could make a big recovery once current industry headwinds pass. PNC may not need a Buffett bailout, but Berkshire (which owned the stock until late 2020) could always decide to re-enter a position.Charles Schwab (SCHW)charles schwab sign outside of a building. SCHD stockSource: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.comCharles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) is best known for its stock brokerage operations, but it makes sense why investors have had serious banking crisis-related concerns about the firm. Schwab’s banking operations are sitting on heavy unrealized bond losses.Rising interest rates have also resulted in clients moving excess cash out of their brokerage accounts in order to take advantage of savings accounts elsewhere offering higher yields. With this trend likely to have a serious impact on future earnings, SCHW stock has fallen by more than 35% since early March.To shore up investor confidence, Charles Schwab could really use the Warren Buffett “seal of approval” right now. However, I wouldn’t count on Berkshire announcing it has purchased a large block of SCHW shares anytime soon. Trading for 13.5 times earnings, the stock is likely fairly priced at best, so not exactly the type of “wonderful business” that Buffett likes to buy.State Street (STT)A photo of the State Street logo on a skyscraperSource: EyeofPaul/Shutterstock.comState Street (NYSE:STT) is yet another major financial services firm caught up in the crisis. Like with Schwab, news of declining deposits has placed considerable pressure on shares in recent months.As a result, STT stock has plunged from around $90 per share to around $69 per share today. However, while Schwab may be fairly priced despite deposit headwinds, the situation may be different with State Street. Following the pullback, shares trade for just 9.5 times earnings.Furthermore, despite concerns about falling net interest margin, analyst forecasts still call for State Street to report solid earnings growth. By 2025, earnings per share (or EPS) could come in at $9.86. Not bad for a $69 stock. Buffett may not be fully bullish on bank stocks right now, but if the dust starts to settle, he may consider undervalued, oversold names like this one.Truist (TFC)Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comTruist (NYSE:TFC) is another super regional bank that has been hammered since March. In fact, with its drop from the mid-$40s to the high-$20 range, the selloff with TFC has been more dramatic than with other super regional bank stocks like PNC.After falling by around 40%, TFC stock today trades at a dirt-cheap 6 times earnings, and sports a forward yield of 7.62%. As a Seeking Alpha commentator has recently argued, this bank is far from stressed. At least, based on the bank’s loan-to-deposit (or LDR) ratio. This bank has a lower LDR ratio than its peers.Instead of being a value trap, Truist may represent deep value at current prices. Similar to State Street, if some of the uncertainty clears up about banking and Buffett decides to increase Berkshire’s bank stocks exposure, TFC may just well be a name he considers.U.S. Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWith Berkshire Hathaway selling nearly all of its stake in 2022, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) may appear at first to be one of the bank stocks least likely to receive some support from Buffett.However, while Buffett may not be looking to buy more USB stock on the open market anytime soon, this could be one of the top contenders to receive a preferred stock investment from Berkshire if its financial condition deteriorates further. As I wrote recently, there is a strong chance the situation with U.S. Bancorp worsens from here.Why? According to a short report issued by Holdco Asset Management, if this bank has to start counting certain unrealized loan losses when calculating its capital ratios, it may need to raise more capital. Given the past investment and relationship, Berkshire looks like a likely provider of potential future capital infusions. On terms favorable to Berkshire, of course.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value stocks and their past performance, and go directly to read 5 Cheap Dividend Stocks With High Yields. The Importance of Investing in Undervalued/Cheap StocksInvesting in value stocks is one of the most popular methods to make money through the stock market. Value strategy involves discovering cheap stocks trading below their intrinsic value and investing in them, expecting them to eventually rise to their accurate value. As the market recognizes the true value of these stocks over time, value investors aim to generate long-term capital appreciation through them. These stocks usually have low price-to-earnings ratios.Over the years, there have been periods where either value or growth stocks have outperformed the other. Their performance has widely depended on various market conditions and investor sentiment. Historical analysis shows that value stocks performed better than growth equities during periods of high-interest rates and inflation. Franklin Templeton published a report on value stocks and highlighted that due to high-interest rates across the world last year, value equities surpassed growth stocks in global markets. The report further mentioned that trailing earnings per share of value companies have grown strongly over the last decade. So far in 2023, growth stocks have reasserted their dominance over value stocks.When analyzing the performance of both value and growth stocks, research has shown that value investing is a reliable strategy for long-term investors. One such study was conducted by Eugene Fama and Ken French and published by Dimensional Fund Advisors. The study cited that value stocks have surpassed their growth counterparts by 4.1% annually in the US from 1927 to 2021. This shows that value investing can be suitable for long-term investors, and is, therefore, one of the most preferred investment options for them.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Small-Cap Value Stocks to Invest InIn addition to their long-term results, many value stocks come from established companies with stable earnings and a history of paying dividends. Long-term investors seeking regular income can benefit from the dividend payments provided by value stocks, which can contribute to total returns over time. Dividend companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are popular among investors as they have raised their dividends for decades. Moreover, these companies also have strong balance sheets, which signal the growth of their future dividends.

So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.7.

The firm also highlighted that the company's performance remained stable following the Silicon Valley Bank fallout.Madison Investments mentioned U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shares are ensnared in the bank-run panic that began late in the quarter. Two large banks failed in early March as depositors rushed to withdraw money on concerns that the banks would suffer from liquidity problems. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, but in the case of the two banks, it was prompted by the revelations of utter mismanagement of their securities portfolio. Bank models are, essentially, to borrow short and lend long. This sounds dangerous of course, and it would be if not for the deposit guarantee provided by the FDIC. The history of the U.S. banking system can be divided into two eras – pre-FDIC, when bank runs were fairly common, and post-FDIC, when bank runs have been close to non-existent. However, FDIC protection has its limits, and it remains incumbent on management to properly manage its assets and liabilities. The two banks in question didn’t do that. By taking down the share prices of all banks, we think investors are shooting first and asking questions later; they are not distinguishing between the strong and the weak.U.S. Bancorp, as one of the largest and best-managed banks in the country, appears to be a net beneficiary so far of the panic among some depositors, with a pick-up in net deposit inflows in recent weeks. We don’t dismiss the probability of industry contagion – in a true nationwide panic, the big banks will suffer along with the small banks, and the well-managed ones will suffer along with the badly-managed ones. But we think the odds of that are quite small, and recent steps by federal regulators confirm that they will do everything in their power to prevent such a scenario, given the calamitous impact that it would have on our economy. We tightly manage this risk by limiting our exposure to the banking sector.”6. Northrim BanCorp, Inc.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study CF Industries Holdings'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CF Industries Holdings is:44% = US$3.5b ÷ US$8.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.44 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.CF Industries Holdings' Earnings Growth And 44% ROETo begin with, CF Industries Holdings has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 16% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, CF Industries Holdings' exceptional 49% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared CF Industries Holdings' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 15%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is CF fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is CF Industries Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?CF Industries Holdings' significant three-year median payout ratio of 56% (where it is retaining only 44% of its income) suggests that the company has been able to achieve a high growth in earnings despite returning most of its income to shareholders.Additionally, CF Industries Holdings has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 25% over the next three years. Still forecasts suggest that CF Industries Holdings' future ROE will drop to 23% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to decrease. This suggests that there could be other factors could driving the anticipated decline in the company's ROE.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with CF Industries Holdings' performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

8,25fa159c-5a24-3a92-addf-2b395ce0926b,CF,2023-05-22,7 Stocks That Are Long Overdue for a Relief Rally,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-long-overdue-relief-114546244.html,1684410346,STORY,"['LDOS', 'QCOM', 'VTRS', 'CF', 'JD', 'BWA']","[Investing is a tug-of-war between bullish and bearish sentiment. Near-term price swings provide long-term investors with great entry points to pick up unfairly beaten-down stocks. Accordingly, astute investors will spend more time focusing on stocks that have traded at undervalued levels for longer than they should. Investors shopping for sold-off stocks overdue for a relief rally may get rewarded with a little patience.There are plenty of stocks poised for a relief rally, which can take various forms due to a wide range of catalysts. Oversold conditions, over time, will attract bargain hunters. However, long-term, sustainable rallies can be driven by positive business catalysts. Analyst upgrades are one such positive driver which can trigger a relief rally.Of course, investors cannot rely solely on stock price movements or bullish ratings from analysts to bet on a rebound. Both are not necessarily predictive of future performance. Instead, investors who research why a stock is discounted are most likely to be rewarded.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese seven stocks have a value score from Stockrover screener, in the range of 72 to 93 out of 100. Thus, they are among the top stocks I think can rally hard from here.BWABorgWarner$44.41CFCF Industries$64.12JDJD.com$37.34LDOSLeidos Holdings$78.55OGNOrganon$20.58QCOMQualcomm$104.81VTRSViatris$9.30BorgWarner (BWA)A stack of auto partsSource: ShutterstockBorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) supplies automotive parts. Partly due to its relatively simple and unattractive business model, this is also a company that’s among the cheapest stocks to buy of its peers, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9-times.Notably, BWA stock dipped after posting Q1/2023 revenue of $4.18 billion. However, its 2023 eProduct sales outlook increase suggests it is due for a relief rally.BorgWarner expects its 2023 electric vehicle sales to grow from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. This is more than double its 2022 sales. Another notable catalyst comes out of China, where Chinese automakers are moving quickly toward hybrid transmissions and range-extended EVs. It’s expected that mass production of the eMotors will start in August 2023. Thus, revenue from BorgWarner’s battery pack business is likely to expand over time. A large global customer has begun using its battery packs for electric buses. Customers trust BorgWarner for its battery safety. This includes current overcharge protection, electrical disconnects, and cell-level passive propagation resistance.Story continuesThe company has accelerating demand, and is expanding its capacity. For example, BorgWarner announced plans to expand its production facility in South Carolina. This increases its battery module production at the facility. As a result, its annual battery module capacity is now around 3-gigawatt hours.CF Industries (CF)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comCF Industries (NYSE:CF) shares peaked at the $100 level between Sep. 2022 and Dec. 2022. Since then, this stock has been on the decline, as the global manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen posted revenue falling by 30.0% year-over-year to $2.01 billion this past quarter.Investors have been avoiding CF stock for many reasons. One such reason is the unpredictability of the agricultural fertilizer market. Various headwinds that began in 2022 and have continued into this year remain. Ultimately, CF Industries is a price taker, so the prices of these raw commodities matter a great deal to its bottom line.That said, despite price volatility, CF’s Q1/2023 results are encouraging. The firm executed a memorandum of understanding with LOTTE CHEMICAL Corporation. LOTTE, South Korea’s leading chemical company, will receive clean ammonia supply.The company is optimistic about growth outside of its traditional fertilizer channels. Demand is likely to continue to remain robust, with CF expecting robust growth through the 2027-2028 timeframe. Overall, CF is well-positioned for growing global demand over the next decade. The company’s recent acquisition of Waggaman Ammonia production facilities from Incitec Pivot Ltd. for $1.675 billion builds the company’s capacity to meet said demand growth.JD.com (JD)the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a buildingSource: testing / Shutterstock.comJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is a China-based e-commerce retailer. JD stock’s most recent peak was at over $60 in January of this year, but has been volatile of late. That’s partly due to the company’s modest revenue growth of 1.4% in Q1 2023, which was too low to impress investors.Outgoing Chief Executive Officer Lei Xu said that JD strengthened profits by streamlining its operations, expanding its service offerings, and optimizing its product portfolio. However, the CEO will resign due to personal reasons. Chief Financial Officer Sandy Xu will become CEO for the third time. A major restructuring is the underlying message of the company’s management reshuffle.On the conference call, CEO Xu said that the firm has already restructured JD Retail and JD Logistics. It will further split into more operational units, such that it may focus on specific product categories. JD needs its management to work closer with its business units to respond faster to changing market conditions.After re-opening following three years of Covid lockdowns, China has yet to recover economically. Western firms are exiting China, as part of their plans to diversify their manufacturing reliance to other countries. With fewer jobs in China, JD needs to maintain the loyalty of its customer base. If it can do that, it’s a buy here.Leidos Holdings (LDOS)An image of a rocket launching to spaceSource: Alexyz3d/ShutterstockLeidos Holdings (NYSE:LDOS) is a science and technology leader. The company posted revenue growth of 6% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Currently, LDOS stock is relatively inexpensive at a forward price-earnings ratio of around 11-times.Looking ahead, investors are clearly nervous that the U.S. debt ceiling will delay President Bien’s $6.9 trillion budget request for the 2024 year. The budget is critical to Leidos realizing revenue from the defense, transportation, NASA, energy, and Veterans Affairs sectors of the government.In Q1, Leidos was focused on navigating supply chain challenges. CFO Chris Cage said that sourcing from China hit the company’s quarterly results. However, as activity levels improved, Leidos could not supply some of the components the market demanded. Thus, the company posted a net book-to-bill ratio of 0.8 times. These bookings are expected increase to 1.0 times in the long-term, once big programs reward contracts with Leidos.Out of the backlog of $35.1 billion, $8.3 billion is funded. Thus, when the debt ceiling fiasco is resolved, I think this stock is poised for a nice rally.Organon (OGN)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comOrganon (NYSE:OGN) is a spinoff between Merck (NYSE:MRK) and its acquisition of Scherling-Plough in 2009. Investors are dumping the stock after the drug company posted earnings per share falling nearly 35% to $1.08. Additionally, the company’s revenue of $1.538 billion fell by 1.9% on a year-over-year basis.I think the recent drop in OGN stock following these results is unwarranted. That’s because investors largely failed to recognize the key driver of the earnings per share drop was related to acquisitions and debt repayment. Organon paid back $250 million in debt, and acquisitions in the quarter included marketing rights for Nexplanon, Marvelon, and Mercilon, which should be accretive to future earnings.Additionally, there are some positive catalysts to focus on. The company saw revenue growth of 20% from its biosimilars business. Additionally, Organon is focusing on an upcoming launch of Hadlima, which treats moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. While Hadmila adds no more than 1.5% to the firm’s 2023 revenue, this number should increase significantly in future years. Organon is waiting for two or three Hadlima formularies, but by 2024 and 2025, the company will have a clearer view of the market for Humira biosimilars.Once Organon updates its outlook, I think there’s a good likelihood this stock rebounds nicely. Currently, OGN is among the cheapest biotech stocks to buy.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor companySource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) peaked at $140 this year, but has since fallen into bargain territory after posting a downbeat outlook. Sluggish smartphone sales are weighing on QCOM stock.The smartphone chip supplier posted revenue of $9.27 billion in its fiscal Q2, which was down by 16.9%. Technology investors typically avoid companies that are not growing, instead discounting a given company’s stock price to account for the slowdown ahead. Qualcomm is forecasting revenue of $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion, well below the consensus of $9.12 billion.The company needs to draw down its excess inventory. Macro headwinds are increasing, hurting demand. Although it has design wins such as digital cockpit and auto connectivity solutions in automotive, those are small revenue drivers compared to sales from smartphone chips.That said, investors may want to consider adding Qualcomm stock, which has been discounted due to the risk of delays in the inventory drawdown of 300 million units. That’s because while the recovery time for the Chinese economy is unknown, over the long-term, these issues will be ironed out. This is a blue-chip stock worth buying the dip on at these levels.Viatris (VTRS)Viatris (VTRS) website page. Viatris.com logo on display screenSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comViatris (NASDAQ:VTRS) is a pharmaceutical firm, formed through the merger of Mylan and Upjohn. Despite Viatris reaffirming its outlook for 2024, shares are languishing. Additionally, it expects its revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to be at the midpoint of its 2023 guidance ranges.The company’s free cash flow forecast should allow Viatris the ability to pay down its debt, buy back shares, and invest in its business. The market is discounting Viatris because of the high-interest rate environment, which increases the cost of managing debt. Investors cannot count on the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. However, such a move would immediately improve the company’s financial position.The latest results of Multiple Sclerosis from Viaris and Mapi Pharma are a potential catalyst for the company. The firms recently released the presentation of their latest clinical findings. The results were impressive, with injections reducing the contrast-enhanced lesions by 28%. Once Viatris has the molecule on the market, its market share for GA Depot (40 mg) will grow.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Foot Locker FL.Dissecting Retail Earnings and Shifting Consumer Spending TrendsIt is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates, and uncertainty about the economy has forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores and digital offerings in response to the aforementioned headwinds. The expected continuation of this same trend is also at the root of management’s upgraded guidance for the year.Another trend at play is the shift in consumer preference for ‘wants’ instead of ‘needs.’ Given the macroeconomic clouds, it makes intuitive sense that consumers will rationally shift away from discretionary spending categories without curbing their demand for essentials. Walmart is better positioned than Target for such an environment, given its significantly bigger grocery business.However, we should keep in mind that consumers aren’t moving away from all discretionary categories as they continue to spend on leisure, hospitality, and travel services. Consumers spent heavily on discretionary ‘goods’ during Covid and seem to be in no hurry to replace them. But they seem to be making up for missing out on the ‘experiential’ discretionary services of the type mentioned above.Some of this is likely tied to income distributions as well, with lower-income consumers restricting their spending to their needs and pulling back on discretionary spending of all types.Story continuesAn excellent example of this is Friday’s Foot Locker bombshell, with the company not only missing estimates but significantly cutting guidance for the year. Foot Locker is heavily exposed to lower-income consumers, and that demographic’s outlook remains uncertain, particularly if the labor market starts losing ground going forward because of macroeconomic factors.The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times, and these are anything but normal times.They need just the right amount of inventory. Otherwise, they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise, as was the case earlier in the pandemic, or will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmartand Targetlast year.Then there is outright theft, referred to as ‘shrink’ by the retailers. Target estimates that ‘shrink’ will be a $500 million hit to its earnings this year. Most management teams shy away from quantifying the full extent of this problem. But published comments from retail industry professionals suggest that the problem has never been this big.Retailers also need to ensure they have the correct type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much patio furniture last Spring that consumers weren’t interested in buying. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just the right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target, and others face daily.Both Walmart and Target have done an excellent job on the inventory front, but part of the reason for the Foot Locker guidance cut is the inventory pileup. What is most intriguing concerning Foot Locker is that they failed to see any of this during their March 2023 update.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart has been better, Target less so.With respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 26 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s official industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 26 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already include the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q1 earnings for these 26 retailers that have reported are up +6.2% from the same period last year on +6.6% higher revenues, with 84.6% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +46.8% on +9.4% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.Q1 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 19th, we now have Q1 earnings from 473 S&amp;P 500 members, or 94.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -3.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with 78% beating EPS estimates and 74.8% beating revenue estimates.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 63%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either.With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears were warning us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have about 150 companies on deck to report results, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. This week’s docket includes Lowe’s, Nvidia, Best Buy, Ralph Lauren, Dicks Sporting Goods, and others.The Earnings Big Picture2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -3.8% on +4.4% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.We get down to earnings on positive revenues when margins are squeezed. That’s what we have been witnessing in the ongoing earnings season, which is in-line with the trend we have been seeing for some time now. In fact, 2023 Q1 is the 5th quarter in a row of declining margins.Actual results provide a lot better on this front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases, with the outperformance particularly notable for the Tech sector.One notable recent development on the earnings front, which we have been flagging in recent weeks, is the reversal on the revisions front, with full-year 2023 earnings starting to go up since the start of April. This comes after almost a year of steady declines in full-year 2023 earnings, which peaked in April 2022.Since the start of 2023 Q2, aggregate bottom-up S&amp;P 500 earnings are flat or unchanged as a whole and +0.4%, excluding the Energy sector, whose estimates have been coming down. In fact, estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are up since the start of Q2, with notable increases in the Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Retail, and Tech sectors. On the negative side, estimates are coming down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Aerospace, and Transportation sectors.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Decoding Recent Positive Earnings Estimate Revisions  Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

On Sunday before departing the G-7, Biden called the GOP's debt-ceiling stance ""unacceptable,"" adding it was ""time for the other side to move from their extreme positions."" This as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's June 1 ""X-date"" looms.On Friday, the two parties put talks on pause, raising doubts about the near-term potential for a deal and sending markets lower.All three major indexes still finished the week with gains, however, notably the Nasdaq, which rose more than 3%.The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 had their best week since March and their highest weekly close since August 2022. Year to date, the Nasdaq is up more than 20%, while the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 9%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is just barely clinging to gains for the year.Stocks were encouraged last week after earnings from the retail sector struck a cautious tone on consumer spending for the year, but didn't sound alarms on a full-on recession quite yet.In the week ahead, results from Dollar General (DG), Costco (COST), and BJ's (BJ) will offer further insights on the health of the consumer. Walmart's results (WMT) hinted at the benefits to some retailers from wealthier consumers trading down to save money as inflation pressures household budgets.""We've seen transactions at Walmart, at Target, at TJX, at Ross positive year over year, which suggests that there is some trade down coming into the value side of the equation as some of those mainstream consumers make different choices,"" Bernstein retail analyst Aneesha Sherman told Yahoo Finance Live on Friday. ""And that's what some of the new data is showing that wasn't the case last year. So for value retail, I think it's a positive.""Story continuesOn the tech front, Nvidia (NVDA), which has seen its stock more than 100% this year, is expected to report earnings on Wednesday.On the economic data front, investors will look for further hints on the Fed's path forward as investors prep for the end of the central bank's most aggressive rate hiking campaign since the early '80s.On Thursday, the second estimate of first quarter GDP will offer a look at growth in the first quarter and another check on the central bank's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, for Q1.Economists expect ""core"" PCE — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and energy — rose 4.9% on an annual basis in the first quarter, unchanged from the first reading; ""core"" PCE is expected to have risen 0.3% in April, a monthly increase unchanged from March.But the debt ceiling will remain the biggest factor for investors until a resolution on the current negotiations can be reached.Traditionally, markets have been more volatile as the ""X-date"" — or the date at which the US would default on its obligations — nears, with the possibility of default weighing on markets most in the two weeks before this date.U.S. President Joe Biden and Indonesia's President Joko Widodo attend a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment event during the G7 summit, at the Grand Prince Hotel in Hiroshima, Japan, May 20, 2023. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (Jonathan Ernst / reuters)""If the X-date is crossed without a formal default, we see the drop in Q2 deepening a further 5% to 3750, but proving temporary,"" UBS's global economics and strategy team wrote in a note to clients on Friday.""A 1-week period of no coupon payment and default would trigger up to a 20% drop in stocks towards 3,400, and keep them suppressed at those low levels through Q3 before making a partial recovery towards 3.800 by year end. The very unlikely scenario of a month long non payment of coupon would not only cause an immediate drop of up to 30% in stocks, it would also see a very weak recovery.""The S&amp;P 500 closed at 4,191 on Friday.Debt ceiling discussions will also take a bigger place in the investor conversation going forward as this week wraps up earnings season.Entering Friday, 94% of the S&amp;P 500 had reported earnings. On average, companies have been beating estimates by 6.5%, per Evercore ISI, while reporting an earnings decline for the second straight quarter.Still, stocks are up since the start of the first quarter earning season and the much discussed looming recession hasn't impacted markets yet.“In thinking about the timing of a Recession, the Consumer remains key,” Julian Emmanuel, who leads Evercore ISI's equity and portfolio strategy, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.""A resilient Consumer was largely the theme in 1Q results, though Banks and Retailers bookending Earnings Season did note some deceleration later in the quarter.

15,1961924d-4740-30c0-be09-b9ee35ca5a0a,JWN,2023-05-22,7 Stocks to Sell if the Fed Keeps Raising Interest Rates,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-sell-fed-keeps-185738975.html,1684349858,STORY,"['JWN', 'LEN-B', 'RDFN', 'SOFI', 'EZPW', 'RKT', 'VRM']","[If we follow the common wisdom, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in what could be its last major action against inflation, which would then make stocks to sell in a hawkish environment seem completely irrelevant. For what it’s worth, I hope that this list of publicly traded enterprises to watch out for ages like milk.Frankly, a deflationary ecosystem – one where fewer dollars chase after more goods – wouldn’t be good for my business. Nevertheless, it’s also to prepare for various scenarios. After all, if the Covid-19 disaster taught us anything, it’s that stability and predictability represent statuses that should never be taken for granted. Therefore, we should consider stocks to sell if the Fed imposes a plot twist.In addition, geopolitical rumblings – particularly the production cuts by the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations – known as OPEC+ – broadcasted that the Fed alone isn’t the only major influencer of the dollar. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on these stocks to sell, just in case.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRedfin (RDFN)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonShould inflation remain stubbornly high, forcing the Fed to respond with continued interest rate hikes, then real estate brokerage firm Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) would probably transition to become one of the stocks to sell. Of course, right now, RDFN appears one of the securities to buy, considering its blistering gain of 135% year-to-date. Still, higher borrowing costs would probably kill the rally.For one thing, even with the brilliant performance in 2023 thus far, it’s still down 9% in the past year. That just shows you how troubled the housing market has been since the Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022. Further, circumstances might worsen for Redfin and its ilk. For current homebuyers, the market doesn’t seem like it’s cooling because of the low inventory dilemma. Nevertheless, on average, the market is fading against the year-ago framework.Story continuesHowever, if the Fed steps in with more aggressive hikes, RDFN might be one of the stocks to sell. Per investment resource Gurufocus, the underlying enterprise suffers from seven red flags, including the issuance of new debt.Lennar (LEN)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockAt the moment, homebuilder Lennar (NYSE:LEN) seems a very attractive company. According to Gurufocus, Lennar sports a solid balance sheet, featuring a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.82 which ranks above 63.55% of its rivals. In addition, its Altman Z-Score pings at 4.73, indicating high fiscal stability and a low risk of imminent bankruptcy. Operationally, Lennar fires on all cylinders. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.5% while its net margin clocks in at 13.86%. Plus, the market prices LEN at a trailing multiple of 7.06. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 63.95% of the competition.However, if the Fed raises rates, LEN could become one of the stocks to sell. Basically, the main concern centers on higher borrowing costs eventually sparking a recession. If mass layoffs accelerate, then housing demand will almost surely correct downward. Further, Lennar would need to keep a close eye on its days’ inventory stat. If this figure gets too elevated, it would be much more difficult to recover if the Fed gets super hawkish.Rocket Companies (RKT)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockWhile Redfin and Lennar above might not be stocks to sell right now, you can make a case that it’s time to start thinking about exiting Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT). While the mortgage-providing enterprise gained over 12% of market value since the Jan. opener, its recent performance presents concerns. For example, in the trailing month, RKT stumbled more than 13%.According to Gurufocus, RKT rates as significantly overvalued and it’s not that difficult to see why. Basically, while Rocket might ping as a discount across certain metrics, with a three-year revenue growth rate of 61% below zero, at some point (soon), the negative fundamentals will catch up. Also, its net margin unsurprisingly sits in negative territory, posing massive risks.If that wasn’t bad enough, Rocket also suffers from a challenged balance sheet. At the moment, its cash-to-debt ratio is 0.09 times, ranked worse than 94% of the competition. As well, its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.03, worse than 97.16% of its peers. I’m afraid it’s probably one of the stocks to sell now.Nordstrom (JWN)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockEven without the help of unfavorable monetary policies by the Fed, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) presents a difficult case for even the most dedicated bulls. Since the beginning of the year, JWN slipped 8%, which might not seem that bad. However, in the trailing one-year period, JWN tanked by almost 42%. And in the past five years, shares slipped just over 68%.Frankly, I don’t like the erosion of value and it keeps fading away. Obviously, if the Fed raises borrowing costs, that’s going to impose a critical roadblock for Nordstrom and its ilk. As a discretionary retail player, people don’t need to go to its department stores. And with entities like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), you can get what you want quickly, cheaply, and conveniently.For me, the biggest barrier centers on consumer sentiment, which sits near multi-year lows. Also, its financials don’t look that hot. Suffering from a negative three-year revenue growth rate, Nordstrom has less-than-desirable stability in the balance sheet. It could easily become one of the stocks to sell if the monetary hawks get their way.Vroom (VRM)earningsSource: ShutterstockTrading for only 78 cents a pop, shares of Vroom (NASDAQ:VRM) already signal massive problems. Further, at this rate, the company – which specializes in online transactions for vehicle purchases – carries a market capitalization of less than $110 million. Since the beginning of this year, VRM dropped over 19% in market value. In the past year, VRM gave up over 48%. For most folks, it’s one of the stocks to sell.Fundamentally, it’s difficult to see how online car dealers can survive in this tough consumer economy. Don’t get me wrong – I believe in auto dealerships because people need transportation. However, without the threat of the Covid-19 pandemic, few have the incentive to trade higher prices for convenient, contactless services. Instead, consumers look for the lowest cost possible.Financially, VRM seems terribly risky. For example, its three-year EBITDA growth rate pings at 29.9% below zero. Also, its trailing-year net margin sank to 17.72% below breakeven. Adding insult to injury, its Altman Z-Score sits at 0.81 below zero, indicating a deeply distressed enterprise.SoFi Technologies (SOFI)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockWhile financial technology (fintech) specialist SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) always garnered popularity among retail investors, it lost much of its sheen recently. As I reported earlier, Wedbush analysts downgraded SOFI stock, warning about a possible significant decline in fee income. In addition, spiking personal loan obligations might impose challenges down the line.According to Gurufocus, its present financial profile is rather unremarkable. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate sits at 22.9% below zero. Its trailing-year net margin lands at 14.25% below breakeven. Also, with a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.4, SoFi ranks slightly better than middling for the industry.Unfortunately, if the Fed does hike rates, the problems impacting SOFI will likely worsen, making it a candidate for stocks to sell. In particular, I’d worry about the personal loan originations. Here, we’re talking about unsecured loans. So, if borrowers can’t pay back the loans, then SoFi would be up a brown creek without a paddle.EZCORP (EZPW)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockWhether EZCORP (NASDAQ:EZPW) sits among the stocks to sell, I can go either way. On the contrarian front, I recognize the cynical nature of EZCORP’s pawn shop business. To be sure, pawn shops provide credit access to the unbanked community, which is important. However, the industry itself can sometimes be predatory. Still, when you’re desperate under difficult economic circumstances, you’ll take bad deals to stay above water.On the other hand, if the Fed continues to raise rates, those who are bullish on EZPW should reassess the narrative. I’m not here to say that you’d be wrong to continue holding EZPW. Unfortunately, though, even pawn shop customers might not want to get loans under unfavorable borrowing costs. In addition, the hawkish environment may stymie the buying-and-selling component of the pawn shop business model.Financially, I wouldn’t consider EZCorp to be distressed. However, it’s not remarkable. For example, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 2.09, which is in the gray zone of fiscal stability. Also, trading at a multiple of 21.32, EZPW is overvalued.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

State-backed Chinese newspaper Global Times called the G7 an ""anti-China workshop.""The G7 singled out China on issues including Taiwan, nuclear arms, economic coercion and human rights abuses.""Crude prices are in no man’s land as energy traders look to see what happens with both debt ceiling talks and with U.S. and China tensions,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at data and analytics firm OANDA.U.S. President Joe Biden and top congressional Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy will meet on Monday to discuss raising the federal government's debt ceiling, just 10 days before the U.S. could face an unprecedented default.The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of other currencies, holding just below a two-month high, as investors waited on fresh signals on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to continue hiking interest rates and watched for news on the U.S. debt ceiling.A stronger dollar can weigh on oil demand by making the fuel more expensive for holders of other currencies.U.S. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said it was a ""close call"" whether he would vote to raise interest rates or pause the central bank's tightening cycle when it meets next month.Higher interest rates boost borrowing costs, which can slow the economy and reduce oil demand.(Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London, Florence Tan in Singapore and Mohi Narayan in New Delhi; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Kirsten Donovan and Lisa Shumaker)]"

This also comes as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned of a mid-June deadline for a U.S. default.Fears of a U.S. default had rattled oil markets over the past week as investors fretted that economic disruptions stemming from such a scenario could hurt oil demand. But crude prices still closed the week marginally higher, aided by some buy signals as the U.S. began refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Brent oil futures fell 0.6% to $75.16 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.5%% to $71.31 a barrel by 21:36 ET (01:36 GMT). Both contracts rose around 2% last week, ending four straight weeks of heavy declines.Crude was somewhat supported by the prospect of supply disruptions in Canada, due to early wildfires in the crude-rich Alberta province. This, coupled with signs of increasing U.S. gasoline demand during the summer season, could tighten oil supplies in the near-term.Weakness in the dollar offered some relief to crude prices, following mixed signals on monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. While a slew of officials signaled that the bank will remain hawkish in the coming months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday that tightening credit conditions may reduce the need to raise interest rates by a big margin.But oil is still on course to end May down nearly 5% - its fifth straight month of losses this year as markets continue to grapple with fears of slowing demand and worsening economic conditions. Oil prices are trading substantially lower for the year, amid growing concerns that a recession in major economies will stymie demand.Story continuesA swathe of weak economic readings from China showed that a post-COVID rebound was slowing down in the world’s largest oil importer, casting doubts over forecasts that China will drive oil demand to record highs this year.While U.S. fuel demand appeared to be improving, supply still remained bloated following an unexpected build in crude inventories.Related ArticlesOil retreats amid uncertainty over debt ceiling talksOil slips as U.S. debt caution offset supply concernsGold steadies below $2,000 as debt ceiling talks continue, Fed in focus]"
21,662f76fb-e92e-3dee-b987-fa4b2c587c31,O,2023-05-22,Small Oil Moves In Where Big Oil Moves Out,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-oil-moves-where-big-210000266.html,1684702800,STORY,['CL=F'],"[A Dutch court ruled against Shell two years ago in a case targeting the supermajor’s emission footprint. It obliged the company to slash its emissions by almost half from 2019 by 2030.In response, then-CEO Ben van Beurden wrote a post on LinkedIn, noting an obvious fact that seems to have remained a mystery for the environmentalists that sued Shell and many more like them.“Imagine Shell decided to stop selling petrol and diesel today. This would certainly cut Shell’s carbon emissions. But it would not help the world one bit. Demand for fuel would not change. People would fill up their cars and delivery trucks at other service stations.”In confirmation of the above simple truth that while there is demand for a product, supply will find its way, the Wall Street Journal this week reported that as oil majors pulled out of higher-emission projects across the world, smaller companies came and took their place.We are now witnessing the same thing that happened in 2016 and 2017 in the North Sea but at a larger scale. Back in 2016/17, majors were leaving the North Sea to focus on lower-cost assets. At the time, emission reduction was not such an emergency. Supermajors just wanted to save on platform decommissioning and high UK taxes.Yet it turned out that there were companies willing to take on those platform decommissioning costs and high taxes—plus the fact of natural depletion—that turned the North Sea into the hottest spot for oil and gas mergers and acquisitions in the world, second only to U.S. shale.Shell sold some North Sea assets in 2017. Chevron remained there. BP put up some of its North Sea assets for sale but kept its presence in the region. Meanwhile, a lesser-known firm by the name of Chrysaor bought $3.8 billion worth of oil and gas assets in the North Sea that same year and three years later merged with Premier Oil to become the largest oil and gas operator in the area.Story continuesRelated: Warren Buffett Buys Up Even More Occidental PetroleumThe story is repeating now on a global scale. The supermajors have been quite explicit in their intentions to focus on low-cost, high-return assets with the added consideration of emission footprints. So, many of them are leaving emission-intensive projects in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.Yet, just like nature, the oil industry cannot stand a vacuum, and smaller companies are taking the freed-up space. “What we are seeing is that the larger companies are reducing their share in aging assets with little upside production that have relatively large emissions,” Audun Martinsen, head of energy service research at Rystad Energy, told the WSJ. “Their space has been filled by smaller exploration and production companies.”According to Rystad, the trend will continue, with offshore investments coming from large public oil companies declining from 45% of the total in 2019 to 37% of the total in 2025. At the same time, smaller, often private companies will increase their share of total investments in oil and gas.Also, the Norwegian-based energy research firm said, investments in new oil and gas production this year, thanks to these smaller companies, are set to hit $100 billion for the second year in a row. All this is happening while Chevron, TotalEnergies, Shell, BP, and Exxon focus on reducing their emissions without going bust.According to the WSJ report, the smaller, often privately owned companies are more nimble than Big Oil supermajors and, as such, are better positioned to take risks with projects that are either new, with a high emission footprint or both.They have lower costs than mammoth organizations like the supermajors and can, according to the WSJ, more quickly recoup their investments in case a downturn looms on the horizon.In Africa, according to Rystad data cited in the report, Big Oil is reducing its presence, but smaller players are happy to fill the void. As a result, the value of new oil and gas deals on the continent hit $21 billion last year, up from $5.5 billion in 2020. The share of oil production held by smaller, independent players is also on the rise.The same trend is noticeable in Latin America. Following the partial exit of the supermajors as they focused on their lower-cost and lower-risk assets, small independents moved in and continued exploring for more oil and gas and extracting what was already discovered.It seems this shift in oil and gas investments will continue, with more and more investment in new production coming from small companies. This is not a welcome development for environmentalists. Because smaller companies cannot be held up to the scrutiny of shareholders that increasingly include representatives of those same environmentalists.Many of the smaller energy firms taking on emission-intensive projects are privately owned. They are only accountable to their owners and relevant regulators. They cannot be pressured into dropping this or that project. All that because of the simple truth expressed in Ben van Beurden’s LinkedIn post from 2021: while there is demand for a product, supply will find a way.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Bank Of America Sees Oil Prices Heading Toward $90 This YearOil Prices Rise Amid Expectations Of A Tightening MarketEU Delays Key Renewable Energy Vote Over Nuclear DisagreementRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.9%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. See our latest analysis for Sealed Air Sealed Air's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. However, prior to this announcement, Sealed Air's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 66.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 18% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendSealed Air Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.52 total annually to $0.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.4% over that duration. Although we can't deny that the dividend has been remarkably stable in the past, the growth has been pretty muted.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Sealed Air has grown earnings per share at 28% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like Sealed Air's DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

The company's stock is leading the pack among well-known chip-makers: AMD (AMD) shares are up 63% on the year, Intel (INTC) has advanced 14%, and Qualcomm (QCOM) shares have actually lost 3.6%.The stock has even outperformed mighty Apple's (AAPL) 35% appreciation.""Nvidia is trading on heroic valuations which time will tell if they are justified,"" quipped Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a client note Monday.To Reid's point, Nvidia's valuation clearly puts the stock in priced-for-perfection territory.The stock trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 63 times, according to Yahoo Finance data. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.8 times.In effect, investors are banking on Nvidia to grow its future earnings by more than three times the rate of the S&amp;P 500.That's a tall order.On a trailing 12-month basis, Nvidia's stock trades on an exorbitant 117 times enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiple. Zooming in on the trailing price-to-sales ratio, investors are greeted with a lofty 27 times multiple.Out of the 57 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 77% rate the stock a buy. There are zero sell ratings on Nvidia's stock on Wall Street.So why the major optimism on Nvidia?

The computer — called Isambard 3 — is based on Nvidia's new high-powered Grace CPU chips.The Grace CPU chips take aim at similar ones offered by AMD and Intel.Story continuesMeantime, OpenAI's popular generative AI platform ChatGPT was developed using Nvidia GPUs.And at its GTC conference in March, Nvidia showed off a host of solutions for training and deploying complex models inherent to generative AI.“We are seeing an acceleration in demand,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance Live. “We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for our DGX AI supercomputers. We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for inference, because of generative AI.”Wall Street's read is that Nvidia is a ""one-stop solution provider"" for all things tied to the hot generative AI movement, potentially leading to bumper profits well into the future.""With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/Networking), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high-performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view,"" JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a research note.Added Sur: ""Bottom line: Nvidia continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors in accelerated computing silicon/systems, software, and ecosystems.""These Nvidia bulls will be put to the test this week on two fronts.The company's AI technology is rumored to be on display at Microsoft's (MSFT) three-day developer conference that kicks off mid-week. And earnings are out after the close of trading on Wednesday.There is some chatter on the Street that no matter what Nvidia does this week, a pause in the stock price may be warranted due to those aforementioned heroic valuations.Warns Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya: ""Post-earnings volatility [on Nvidia] it to be expected given sky-high expectations and the stock's 97% return year to date (vs. Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 18%).""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

For retirees, dividend payments can help replace employment earnings and supplement pension income. For these reasons, many investors seek out income from stocks that pay high dividends on a consistent basis. The best dividend stocks are known as the “Dividend Aristocrats,” a select group of companies that have raised their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years.Dividend Aristocrats are a rare breed. There are only 68 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index that have hiked their payout to shareholders for a quarter century without missing a year. Many companies end up suspending or reducing their dividend payments during difficult economic times.So, for investors who count on passive income from their investments, Dividend Aristocrats can serve as a financial lifeline.

The company known for making Scotch tape and Post-It notes has seen its share price fall 33% over the past 12 months, including a 16.5% decline so far in 2023.Has the stock bottomed?It’s difficult to say. But with a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6 and a market capitalization of $55.3 billion, MMM stock looks cheap right now. Plus, the stock currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.50 a share, which equates to a sky-high yield of 6%.In fact, 3M’s dividend is one of the highest among companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 index, making it an extremely attractive option for investors seeking to generate income.3M also has one of the best track records of any company when it comes to paying a dividend. Founded in 1902, 3M has paid dividends to its shareholders for more than 100 years, and it has raised its dividend for 64 consecutive years. That actually makes MMM stock a “Dividend King” and places it in the highest order of dividend aristocrats.Story continuesIBM (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

The company has raised its payout for 28 consecutive years.The dividend is viewed as safe given the company’s strong cash flow generation and should be considered a reward to shareholders who have stuck with IBM stock over the years despite its lagging performance.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is another company whose stock is sitting near its 52-week low.

The company has increased its dividend payout to shareholders for 47 years in a row.Walgreen’s high dividend yield makes it one of the “Dogs of the Dow,” a select group of the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow 30 index. MMM and IBM are also on the Dogs of the Dow list.While Walgreens’ business and share price continue to struggle (the stock is down 50% over five years), the company has prioritized its dividend, attracting income investors as a result.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Archer-Daniels-Midland's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Archer-Daniels-Midland is:18% = US$4.5b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.18 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Archer-Daniels-Midland's Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo start with, Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Archer-Daniels-Midland's significant 23% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Archer-Daniels-Midland's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 7.9% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ADM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The three-year median payout ratio for Archer-Daniels-Midland is 32%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 68%. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Archer-Daniels-Midland is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Moreover, Archer-Daniels-Midland is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 32%. Regardless, Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROE is speculated to decline to 11% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Archer-Daniels-Midland's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

36,ddf97459-9f8a-35b5-9270-f2e6735323b0,MAT,2023-05-22,Mattel's (NASDAQ:MAT) Returns On Capital Are Heading Higher,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mattels-nasdaq-mat-returns-capital-104441341.html,1684752281.0,STORY,['MAT'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Mattel, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$520m ÷ (US$5.8b - US$969m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Mattel has an ROCE of 11%.  In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Leisure industry average of 19%, it's not as good. Check out our latest analysis for Mattel roceIn the above chart we have measured Mattel's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Mattel Tell Us?We're delighted to see that Mattel is reaping rewards from its investments and has now broken into profitability. The company was generating losses five years ago, but has managed to turn it around and as we saw earlier is now earning 11%, which is always encouraging. On top of that, what's interesting is that the amount of capital being employed has remained steady, so the business hasn't needed to put any additional money to work to generate these higher returns. With no noticeable increase in capital employed, it's worth knowing what the company plans on doing going forward in regards to reinvesting and growing the business. After all, a company can only become a long term multi-bagger if it continually reinvests in itself at high rates of return.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayAs discussed above, Mattel appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has only returned 22% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.Mattel does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is a bit concerning...For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

37,c2c184df-58a6-3c1e-a602-1c51edc4e6b1,SLB,2023-05-22,"With 83% ownership of the shares, Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/83-ownership-shares-schlumberger-limited-130025491.html,1684674025,STORY,['SLB'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Schlumberger's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 21 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Schlumberger. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Schlumberger?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Schlumberger already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Schlumberger, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Schlumberger is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.9% of shares outstanding. With 7.4% and 5.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SchlumbergerThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Schlumberger Limited in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$148m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Schlumberger   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

This will take the annual payment to 5.7% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. View our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt Leggett &amp; Platt's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The last payment made up 88% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 2.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could reach 93%, which is definitely on the higher side.historic-dividendLeggett &amp; Platt Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.16, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.84. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.7% over that duration. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Unfortunately, Leggett &amp; Platt's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year.Our Thoughts On Leggett &amp; Platt's DividendOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

(NYSE:AIG) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.36 on the 30th of June, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the annual payment to 2.7% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. See our latest analysis for American International Group American International Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. However, American International Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 8.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 17%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendAmerican International Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.40 total annually to $1.44. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 14% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that American International Group has been growing its earnings per share at 58% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.We Really Like American International Group's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that American International Group is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

Gross profit margins expanded to 26.3% compared to 25.7% a year ago.The company's chief operating officer John Mulligan told analysts on a conference call that last year's ""excess inventory"" problem was now in the ""rearview mirror.""TJX Companies — the owner of T.J.Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods — also posted better margins as inventory levels declined 8% and cost pressures eased.On a call with analysts, TJX CFO John Klinger said the off-price retailer is “strongly positioned” to take advantage of the current deal-hunting environment and feels “great” about current inventory levels.Walmart's US inventory fell 9.4% in the first quarter from a year ago, but profit margins still declined. In part, that was because shoppers spent more on lower-margin groceries and less on big-ticket, higher-margin items like home goods and electronics.The inventory plunges represent a dramatic reversal from less than a year ago.That's when levels were at record highs after stores over-ordered and were sitting on more than $730 billion of merchandise that more cautious consumers weren’t interested in buying.""We're way past the peak [on inventory],"" Bernstein Analyst Aneesha Sherman told Yahoo! Finance Live. ""Many leading brands and retailers have cleared it off their balance sheets.""Story continuesFurther improvements in supply chains — after the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the flow of goods —have also helped retailers.""Many of the pandemic-fueled supply chain issues have resolved, so retailers can again count on delivery accuracy,"" former Toys 'R' Us CEO Gerald Storch told Yahoo Finance Live.Storch added, ""This allows a more 'just-in-time' approach to function,"" which gives retailers the ability to keep their inventory lean and adapt to changing demands.More retailers slated to report earnings this week, such as American Eagle Outfitters, Lowe's, and Big Lots, could also deliver welcomed inventory declines to investors.So far, investors appear to have ignored the improvements in inventory levels — instead paying closer attention to what looks to be a slow start to the second quarter for retail.Target, Walmart, and Foot Locker (FL) all served up cautious comments on the state of the consumer as they battle with elevated inflation.The VanEck Retail ETF (RTH) has risen slightly in the past five trading sessions as retail earnings have trickled in. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.5% over that same stretch.""There'll be winners and losers. Not all boats rise. And just because you have value attached to your name doesn't mean you'll win, either,"" Storch said.But provided the economy doesn't fall off a cliff, lean inventories at retailers set the stage for more margin gains during the crucial upcoming back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.That may ultimately get the attention of skeptical investors.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So while TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on TJX Companies is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$29b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Therefore, TJX Companies has an ROCE of 27%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Specialty Retail industry average of 15%. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured TJX Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering TJX Companies here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at TJX Companies doesn't inspire confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 45%, but they have dropped over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.What We Can Learn From TJX Companies' ROCETo conclude, we've found that TJX Companies is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 93% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing TJX Companies that you might find interesting.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Start your 7-day trial to get on board.FTC expected to sue to block Horizon/Amgen merger dealHorizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP) shares plunged more than 14% on Tuesday after the report that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to introduce a lawsuit to block the proposed $27.8 billion merger with Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).The FTC is concerned about the overlap in the portfolios of the companies, specifically regarding Lupus and Eczema treatments. Hence, the merger would harm the development of drugs in these areas.Amgen expressed its disappointment with the decision, noting that the medicines offered by Amgen and Horizon generally treat different diseases and patient populations, and there are no overlaps of competitive concern. According to Amgen, the FTC's remark that it may ""bundle"" these medicines in the future is entirely speculative and does not reflect the real-world competitive dynamics behind providing rare-disease medicines to patients.Horizon shares closed the week with more than a 9% loss, while Amgen fell around 3%.Magellan Midstream surges on Oneok acquisition announcement Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) shares jumped nearly 13% on Monday after ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) announced it will acquire the company in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $18.8B, as InvestingPro reported in real time.The total enterprise value of the combined company is expected to be $60B. The transaction is expected to close in Q3/23.According to Oneok CEO Pierce Norton, the combination will form a diverse North American midstream infrastructure company with primarily fee-based earnings, a robust balance sheet, and enhanced financial flexibility.Story continuesStill, Oneok shares fell around 9% on Monday as some analysts said that investors may prefer the company to keep its focus on natural gas.New Relic stock jumps 10% on Francisco Partners &amp; TPG acquisition newsPrivate-equity firms Francisco Partners and TPG (NASDAQ:TPG) are collaborating on a bid exceeding $5B to acquire software company New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), according to a WSJ report, citing people familiar with the matter.New Relic shares jumped more than 10% on Thursday following the news.The deal, if successful, is anticipated to be finalized within the upcoming weeks, but there is a possibility that the negotiations might collapse, leading to the emergence of other potential buyers.Urstadt Biddle jumps 28% on Regency Centers acquisition announcement Urstadt Biddle (NYSE:UBP) shares surged more than 28% on Thursday following the acquisition announcement by Regency Centers (NASDAQ:REG).

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics General Dynamics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Senior VP, Gregory Gallopoulos, for US$2.5m worth of shares, at about US$228 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$211. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). Gregory Gallopoulos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like General Dynamics better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.General Dynamics Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, General Dynamics insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Independent Director Mark Malcolm spent US$1.0m on stock, and there wasn't any selling. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Does General Dynamics Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. General Dynamics insiders own about US$3.6b worth of shares (which is 6.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The General Dynamics Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. The recent buying by an insider , along with high insider ownership, suggest that General Dynamics insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for General Dynamics that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

However, if you want to go straight to the top five stocks, you can look at the 5 Stocks Warren Buffett Sold.Berkshire Hathaway, headed by Warren Buffett, sold $13.3 billion worth of stock in the first quarter of 2023 while investing only a fraction of that amount in US equities. This is because the market appeared unappealing to the veteran investor. Instead, the company spent $4.4 billion buying back its stock and $2.9 billion on publicly traded businesses. According to Buffett and his long-time colleague Charlie Munger, Berkshire is struggling to put its $130.6 billion cash pile to work due to high valuations.Buffett said at the company's latest annual meeting that he expected earnings to decline in most of the company's businesses this year as the economy slows and interest rates rise.Berkshire's stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was valued at $151 billion at the end of the quarter, just under half the value of its entire stock portfolio. Berkshire's stock has risen 4.9% since the start of the year. At the annual shareholder meeting, Buffett reiterated his support for low-cost index funds and warned against making ""stupid mistakes"" that could lead to debt. He also stressed the importance of staying rational when making investment decisions. Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman Charlie Munger emphasized the value of intelligence and advocated for more free trade with China. Buffett and Munger agreed that increased competition would make value investing more difficult.Buffett has ramped up efforts to exit banking stocks and adjust his portfolio in the past few quarters primarily because of the Covid-19 pandemic that unbalanced the sector and led to the accelerated collapse of First Republic Bank (OTCMKTS:FRCB), Silicon Valley Bank (NASDAQ:SIVB), Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY), and Silvergate Capital Corporation (NYSE:SI). In this regard, this article discusses the 15 stocks the billionaire investor sold.Story continuesStocks Warren Buffett SoldOur MethodologyFor this article we analyzed Buffett's 13F filings for the past 10 quarters and identified the stocks the billionaire sold during this period.

Here is what the fund said:""Among the positions we exited was Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in the financials sector. Synchrony is a private-label credit card issuer that works with retailers and affinity groups. While we still believe the company is substantially undervalued, we ultimately decided to consolidate our exposure to the private credit industry in our investment in Capital One. While both companies share similar drivers, Synchrony has greater exposure to late fees, which the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is actively focused on reducing, increasing the risk of a decline in the company's earnings."" 11.

Management's guidance implies FY22 Adjusted EBITDA of $2.05B, at the respective midpoints, or an Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDA multiple of ~7.0x.""9. Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD)Stock returns since Warren Buffett sold: -14% SPY total return in the same period (annualized return): 11% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) is a mining company that produces gold and copper. It is the world's second-largest gold miner and operates in 13 countries. Berkshire Hathaway acquired a stake in the company in Q2 2020, surprising many investors who saw Buffett as a critic of gold as an investment – it acquired 20.9 million shares, worth about $564 million at the time. This boosted the share price of Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) and other gold miners as gold prices reached record highs amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Buffett offloaded the shares in the same year, in Q4 2020, as gold prices retreated from their record highs. Since Buffett's exit, Barrick Gold's share price has fluctuated between $18.64 and $28.50 per share.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Old West Management provided the following statement regarding Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD):""Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) is the second largest gold miner in the world, with operations in the U.S., Canada, Africa, South America, and more. Barrick is also a major copper producer. Former Goldman Sachs executive John Thornton took control of the company in 2012 and quickly realized he wanted someone with a mining background to run the company. Mark Bristow, at that time CEO of Randgold, was considered one of the best gold mining executives in the world. Thornton wanted Bristow so badly Barrick bought Randgold in 2018. Bristow, who is South African, had extensive experience operating mines throughout Africa, and, in fact, would fly his own single-engine plane to visit mines. In addition, he has his Ph.D. in Geology and has flourished running Barrick for the past five years.Barrick is estimated to have $1.6 billion of net income this year on $11.5 billion of revenue. Net Income has been growing by 15% per year. The stock trades at $19.00 per share, 16 times forward earnings, and has a 3.15% dividend yield. Barrick has a fortress balance sheet with $5.7 billion in cash and $5 billion of long-term debt, which is only one time EBITDA.""8. Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. (NYSE:AXTA)Stock returns since Warren Buffett sold: 1.14% SPY total return in the same period (annualized return): 3.94% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. (NYSE:AXTA) produces and distributes high-performance coatings systems across several regions worldwide. The company's Q1 2023 financial results showed a 9.4% YoY increase in net sales due to improved pricing and volume growth, with improved operating margins and adjusted EBIT margins YoYWarren Buffett began purchasing Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. (NYSE:AXTA) shares in Q2 2015 and steadily increased his stake to 13.89 million shares by Q1 2021. However, he divested his entire position in the company during Q2 2021.7. Suncor Energy Inc (NYSE:SU)Stock returns since Warren Buffett sold: 70.92% SPY total return in the same period (annualized return): 10.09% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Suncor Energy Inc (NYSE:SU) operates in the Canadian oil and gas industry. Its activities concentrate on exploration and production of oil and gas, as well as refining and marketing it to millions of customers across the globe. The company also recently entered the renewable energy sector. The Suncor Energy Inc (NYSE:SU) stock performance has been volatile since Q4 2020 (when Berkshire Hathaway exited), reflecting the fluctuations in oil prices and demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the OPEC+ supply cuts. The share price reached a four-year high of $41.31 on June 10, 2022, but then shed more than 40% of the gains in just three months.Here is what Artisan Partners said about Suncor Energy Inc (NYSE:SU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU), a Canada-based operator of oil sands mines, refineries and retail gas stations, was the third-largest contributor to return for the year, mainly due to higher oil prices. The share price increased by one third. Notably, the portfolio generated significant returns from energy stocks, including Suncor, Tenaris, Imperial Oil and tangentially Alimentation Couche-Tarde and Seven &amp; i Holdings, both of which are in the gas station business. Given the cyclicality and commodity nature of the oil business, we have sold shares of these investments, including the complete sale of both Tenaris and Imperial Oil.” 6. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Stock returns since Warren Buffett sold: -15% SPY total return in the same period (annualized return): 10.65% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a major US telecom company offering wireless, broadband, video, and media services to millions of customers. It operates under two segments: Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group. Buffett bought into the company in 2020 – Berkshire bought 146.7 million shares of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), valued at about $8.6 billion at the end of 2020. However, they started shedding the shares in early 2022 and finally exited in Q2 2022. Since Berkshire Hathaway's exit, the company's stock has performed poorly, falling by about 15% from May 2022 to May 2023.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) was mentioned in Mawer Investment Management's Q3 2022 investor letter with the following statement:""There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been impacted as wireless operators are spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses."" Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks Warren Buffett Sold. Suggested articles:25 Cleanest Cities in the U.S.Top 20 High Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts20 Most Profitable Etsy Businesses And ItemsDisclosure: None. 15 Stocks Warren Buffett Sold is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The company's stock is leading the pack among well-known chip-makers: AMD (AMD) shares are up 63% on the year, Intel (INTC) has advanced 14%, and Qualcomm (QCOM) shares have actually lost 3.6%.The stock has even outperformed mighty Apple's (AAPL) 35% appreciation.""Nvidia is trading on heroic valuations which time will tell if they are justified,"" quipped Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a client note Monday.To Reid's point, Nvidia's valuation clearly puts the stock in priced-for-perfection territory.The stock trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 63 times, according to Yahoo Finance data. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.8 times.In effect, investors are banking on Nvidia to grow its future earnings by more than three times the rate of the S&amp;P 500.That's a tall order.On a trailing 12-month basis, Nvidia's stock trades on an exorbitant 117 times enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiple. Zooming in on the trailing price-to-sales ratio, investors are greeted with a lofty 27 times multiple.Out of the 57 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 77% rate the stock a buy. There are zero sell ratings on Nvidia's stock on Wall Street.So why the major optimism on Nvidia? Look no further than what Nvidia is building on the supercomputing and AI fronts.Microchip and Nvidia logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in this multiple exposure illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on April 10, 2023. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)Monday brought news out of Germany, where Reuters reported the company unveiled a new supercomputer in partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) at a supercomputing conference. The computer — called Isambard 3 — is based on Nvidia's new high-powered Grace CPU chips.The Grace CPU chips take aim at similar ones offered by AMD and Intel.Story continuesMeantime, OpenAI's popular generative AI platform ChatGPT was developed using Nvidia GPUs.And at its GTC conference in March, Nvidia showed off a host of solutions for training and deploying complex models inherent to generative AI.“We are seeing an acceleration in demand,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance Live. “We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for our DGX AI supercomputers. We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for inference, because of generative AI.”Wall Street's read is that Nvidia is a ""one-stop solution provider"" for all things tied to the hot generative AI movement, potentially leading to bumper profits well into the future.""With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/Networking), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high-performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view,"" JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a research note.Added Sur: ""Bottom line: Nvidia continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors in accelerated computing silicon/systems, software, and ecosystems.""These Nvidia bulls will be put to the test this week on two fronts.The company's AI technology is rumored to be on display at Microsoft's (MSFT) three-day developer conference that kicks off mid-week. And earnings are out after the close of trading on Wednesday.There is some chatter on the Street that no matter what Nvidia does this week, a pause in the stock price may be warranted due to those aforementioned heroic valuations.Warns Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya: ""Post-earnings volatility [on Nvidia] it to be expected given sky-high expectations and the stock's 97% return year to date (vs. Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 18%).""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

55,25fa159c-5a24-3a92-addf-2b395ce0926b,QCOM,2023-05-22,7 Stocks That Are Long Overdue for a Relief Rally,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-long-overdue-relief-114546244.html,1684410346,STORY,"['LDOS', 'QCOM', 'VTRS', 'CF', 'JD', 'BWA']","[Investing is a tug-of-war between bullish and bearish sentiment. Near-term price swings provide long-term investors with great entry points to pick up unfairly beaten-down stocks. Accordingly, astute investors will spend more time focusing on stocks that have traded at undervalued levels for longer than they should. Investors shopping for sold-off stocks overdue for a relief rally may get rewarded with a little patience.There are plenty of stocks poised for a relief rally, which can take various forms due to a wide range of catalysts. Oversold conditions, over time, will attract bargain hunters. However, long-term, sustainable rallies can be driven by positive business catalysts. Analyst upgrades are one such positive driver which can trigger a relief rally.Of course, investors cannot rely solely on stock price movements or bullish ratings from analysts to bet on a rebound. Both are not necessarily predictive of future performance. Instead, investors who research why a stock is discounted are most likely to be rewarded.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese seven stocks have a value score from Stockrover screener, in the range of 72 to 93 out of 100. Thus, they are among the top stocks I think can rally hard from here.BWABorgWarner$44.41CFCF Industries$64.12JDJD.com$37.34LDOSLeidos Holdings$78.55OGNOrganon$20.58QCOMQualcomm$104.81VTRSViatris$9.30BorgWarner (BWA)A stack of auto partsSource: ShutterstockBorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) supplies automotive parts. Partly due to its relatively simple and unattractive business model, this is also a company that’s among the cheapest stocks to buy of its peers, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9-times.Notably, BWA stock dipped after posting Q1/2023 revenue of $4.18 billion. However, its 2023 eProduct sales outlook increase suggests it is due for a relief rally.BorgWarner expects its 2023 electric vehicle sales to grow from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. This is more than double its 2022 sales. Another notable catalyst comes out of China, where Chinese automakers are moving quickly toward hybrid transmissions and range-extended EVs. It’s expected that mass production of the eMotors will start in August 2023. Thus, revenue from BorgWarner’s battery pack business is likely to expand over time. A large global customer has begun using its battery packs for electric buses. Customers trust BorgWarner for its battery safety. This includes current overcharge protection, electrical disconnects, and cell-level passive propagation resistance.Story continuesThe company has accelerating demand, and is expanding its capacity. For example, BorgWarner announced plans to expand its production facility in South Carolina. This increases its battery module production at the facility. As a result, its annual battery module capacity is now around 3-gigawatt hours.CF Industries (CF)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comCF Industries (NYSE:CF) shares peaked at the $100 level between Sep. 2022 and Dec. 2022. Since then, this stock has been on the decline, as the global manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen posted revenue falling by 30.0% year-over-year to $2.01 billion this past quarter.Investors have been avoiding CF stock for many reasons. One such reason is the unpredictability of the agricultural fertilizer market. Various headwinds that began in 2022 and have continued into this year remain. Ultimately, CF Industries is a price taker, so the prices of these raw commodities matter a great deal to its bottom line.That said, despite price volatility, CF’s Q1/2023 results are encouraging. The firm executed a memorandum of understanding with LOTTE CHEMICAL Corporation. LOTTE, South Korea’s leading chemical company, will receive clean ammonia supply.The company is optimistic about growth outside of its traditional fertilizer channels. Demand is likely to continue to remain robust, with CF expecting robust growth through the 2027-2028 timeframe. Overall, CF is well-positioned for growing global demand over the next decade. The company’s recent acquisition of Waggaman Ammonia production facilities from Incitec Pivot Ltd. for $1.675 billion builds the company’s capacity to meet said demand growth.JD.com (JD)the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a buildingSource: testing / Shutterstock.comJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is a China-based e-commerce retailer. JD stock’s most recent peak was at over $60 in January of this year, but has been volatile of late. That’s partly due to the company’s modest revenue growth of 1.4% in Q1 2023, which was too low to impress investors.Outgoing Chief Executive Officer Lei Xu said that JD strengthened profits by streamlining its operations, expanding its service offerings, and optimizing its product portfolio. However, the CEO will resign due to personal reasons. Chief Financial Officer Sandy Xu will become CEO for the third time. A major restructuring is the underlying message of the company’s management reshuffle.On the conference call, CEO Xu said that the firm has already restructured JD Retail and JD Logistics. It will further split into more operational units, such that it may focus on specific product categories. JD needs its management to work closer with its business units to respond faster to changing market conditions.After re-opening following three years of Covid lockdowns, China has yet to recover economically. Western firms are exiting China, as part of their plans to diversify their manufacturing reliance to other countries. With fewer jobs in China, JD needs to maintain the loyalty of its customer base. If it can do that, it’s a buy here.Leidos Holdings (LDOS)An image of a rocket launching to spaceSource: Alexyz3d/ShutterstockLeidos Holdings (NYSE:LDOS) is a science and technology leader. The company posted revenue growth of 6% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Currently, LDOS stock is relatively inexpensive at a forward price-earnings ratio of around 11-times.Looking ahead, investors are clearly nervous that the U.S. debt ceiling will delay President Bien’s $6.9 trillion budget request for the 2024 year. The budget is critical to Leidos realizing revenue from the defense, transportation, NASA, energy, and Veterans Affairs sectors of the government.In Q1, Leidos was focused on navigating supply chain challenges. CFO Chris Cage said that sourcing from China hit the company’s quarterly results. However, as activity levels improved, Leidos could not supply some of the components the market demanded. Thus, the company posted a net book-to-bill ratio of 0.8 times. These bookings are expected increase to 1.0 times in the long-term, once big programs reward contracts with Leidos.Out of the backlog of $35.1 billion, $8.3 billion is funded. Thus, when the debt ceiling fiasco is resolved, I think this stock is poised for a nice rally.Organon (OGN)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comOrganon (NYSE:OGN) is a spinoff between Merck (NYSE:MRK) and its acquisition of Scherling-Plough in 2009. Investors are dumping the stock after the drug company posted earnings per share falling nearly 35% to $1.08. Additionally, the company’s revenue of $1.538 billion fell by 1.9% on a year-over-year basis.I think the recent drop in OGN stock following these results is unwarranted. That’s because investors largely failed to recognize the key driver of the earnings per share drop was related to acquisitions and debt repayment. Organon paid back $250 million in debt, and acquisitions in the quarter included marketing rights for Nexplanon, Marvelon, and Mercilon, which should be accretive to future earnings.Additionally, there are some positive catalysts to focus on. The company saw revenue growth of 20% from its biosimilars business. Additionally, Organon is focusing on an upcoming launch of Hadlima, which treats moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. While Hadmila adds no more than 1.5% to the firm’s 2023 revenue, this number should increase significantly in future years. Organon is waiting for two or three Hadlima formularies, but by 2024 and 2025, the company will have a clearer view of the market for Humira biosimilars.Once Organon updates its outlook, I think there’s a good likelihood this stock rebounds nicely. Currently, OGN is among the cheapest biotech stocks to buy.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor companySource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) peaked at $140 this year, but has since fallen into bargain territory after posting a downbeat outlook. Sluggish smartphone sales are weighing on QCOM stock.The smartphone chip supplier posted revenue of $9.27 billion in its fiscal Q2, which was down by 16.9%. Technology investors typically avoid companies that are not growing, instead discounting a given company’s stock price to account for the slowdown ahead. Qualcomm is forecasting revenue of $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion, well below the consensus of $9.12 billion.The company needs to draw down its excess inventory. Macro headwinds are increasing, hurting demand. Although it has design wins such as digital cockpit and auto connectivity solutions in automotive, those are small revenue drivers compared to sales from smartphone chips.That said, investors may want to consider adding Qualcomm stock, which has been discounted due to the risk of delays in the inventory drawdown of 300 million units. That’s because while the recovery time for the Chinese economy is unknown, over the long-term, these issues will be ironed out. This is a blue-chip stock worth buying the dip on at these levels.Viatris (VTRS)Viatris (VTRS) website page. Viatris.com logo on display screenSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comViatris (NASDAQ:VTRS) is a pharmaceutical firm, formed through the merger of Mylan and Upjohn. Despite Viatris reaffirming its outlook for 2024, shares are languishing. Additionally, it expects its revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to be at the midpoint of its 2023 guidance ranges.The company’s free cash flow forecast should allow Viatris the ability to pay down its debt, buy back shares, and invest in its business. The market is discounting Viatris because of the high-interest rate environment, which increases the cost of managing debt. Investors cannot count on the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. However, such a move would immediately improve the company’s financial position.The latest results of Multiple Sclerosis from Viaris and Mapi Pharma are a potential catalyst for the company. The firms recently released the presentation of their latest clinical findings. The results were impressive, with injections reducing the contrast-enhanced lesions by 28%. Once Viatris has the molecule on the market, its market share for GA Depot (40 mg) will grow.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Pictured, Fogel (left) appears at Skift Global Forum in New York City in September 2022. Source: SkiftIn monitoring online travel CEO compensation packages over the years, it’s always interesting to see these leaders receive what may be looked at as lifetime achievement awards, a monetary “thank you.” At long last, it’s time to cash in.In 2013, some observers might have been taken aback when Tripadvisor co-founder and then-CEO Steve Kaufer commanded total compensation of $39 million, only to be followed by another $48 million in 2017. That turned out to be small compared with Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky’s $120 million total compensation package in 2020. Even more dramatic was Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern’s compensation package of close to $300 million in 2021.The pay packages for 2022 are a tad smaller – and may seem outrageous to some.The online travel boss with the largest award in 2022 was Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel. He got close to $31 million, a 404:1 ratio to the median employee at the company.Sonder’s Francis Davidson, was number two, with $21.6 million, including $20.1 million in stock awards. Davidson co-founded the hospitality company, has served as CEO since 2014, and took the company public in a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, deal in January 2022.But its stock price, $8.95 at the IPO, finished the year at $1.42. In 2023 — which didn’t have any bearing on the 2022 package — Sonder faces a potential delisting from the Nasdaq.Much of the compensation we’re discussing is theoretical, potentially earned over the coming years, and contingent on reaching certain performance targets.10 Largest Online Travel Pay Packages 2022RankExecutiveCompanyTitle2022 Pay Package1.Glenn FogelBooking HoldingsCEO$30.78 million2.Francis DavidsonSonderCEO$21.6 million3.Julie WhalenExpediaCFO$16.4 million4.Matt GoldbergTripadvisorCEO$14.5 million5.Rob GreyberVacasaCEO$13.3 million6.David GouldenBooking HoldingsCFO$12.12 million7.Peter MillonesBooking HoldingsGeneral Counsel$11.16 millon8..Aristotle BaloghAirbnbCTO$10.6 million9.Dave StephensonAirbnbCFO$10.1 million10.Catherine PowellAirbnbHead of Hosting$9.5 millionSource: Skift/public filingsStory continuesA Wall Street Journal-commissioned study found that the majority of CEOs’ payola in 2022 turned out to be considerably smaller than previously valued, a trend not seen for 10 years or so.“The numbers show that in 2022 about two-thirds of the top executives at S&amp;P 500 companies ended the year with smaller pay packages than they were awarded, at least on paper,” the story said.Asked about Davidson’s compensation package given the company’s struggles, the company said: “Performance awards accounted for over 90 percent of our total CEO compensation in 2022, and they only start to actualize when our stock price goes above $13 per share. A dollar value is assigned to performance awards for accounting purposes, but our CEO only benefits when the stock price goes above $13 per share and other shareholders benefit.”Sonder closed trading Friday at $0.65 per share so Davidson will have an enormous hurdle to actually receive the value of his compensation award.Glenn Fogel Was Top BossThe package for Fogel from Booking Holdings, which touts Booking.com, Kayak and Priceline among its brands, was a comedown from his 2021 package of $54 million.If you’d invested $100 in Booking’s stock at the end of 2019, the total shareholder return would have been $98.13 compared with $81.50 for what Booking considers to be its peer group.Booking generated more than $3 billion in net income in 2022, although the company doesn’t use these metrics to determine pay packages. Among the factors the board weighed were record revenue, gross bookings and room nights, $6.5 billion in stock repurchases, and progress in expanding in the U.S. market. Booking.com is headquartered in Amsterdam.Companies in many other parts of the world don’t publicly disclose CEO compensation, but European pay packages tend to be lower than their U.S. counterparts.Expedia Group CFO Julie Whalen’s Pay Topped CEOs of Tripadvisor and VacasaAmong other highlights of the 2022 compensation packages: Expedia Group Chief Financial Officer Julie Whalen was awarded $16.4 million – $15.8 million of which was in performance-based stock awards.That was larger than two new CEOs in 2022: Matt Goldberg of Tripadvisor and Rob Greyber of Vacasa.“Upon her appointment as Expedia Group’s Chief Financial Officer on September 26, 2022, Ms. Whalen’s stock target was established at 17,342 shares (3x salary) until the next measurement date,” a financial filing stated. “Ms. Whalen has not yet met her target and therefore she is currently subject to the holdback.”Travel CEO Pay in 2022Highest-Paid Hotel CEOsHighest-Paid U.S. Airline CEOs in 2022Highest-Paid Cruise Industry CEOsExpedia Group CEO Peter Kern’s total compensation package in 2022 was a relatively modest $1.1 million, but that followed his close to $300 million award in 2021.Don’t Shed Tears for Brian Chesky’s CompensationLike Kern of Expedia, Airbnb’s Brian Chesky didn’t make the 2022 top 10 list, with a mere $311,000 award, down from $120 million in 2020.If you’d invested $100 in Airbnb stock when it went public on December 10, 2020, Airbnb calculated that investment would have been worth $143 at the end of 2022.Airbnb Chief Technology Officer Aristotle Balogh, Chief Financial Officer David Stephenson, and Global Head of Hosting Catherine Powell all got compensation packages of around $10 million in 2022.That put them in the top 10 and ahead of packages for Barry Diller, the Expedia Group chairman ($8 million) and Airbnb co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Nathan  Blecharczyk ($7.6 million).Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

(NASDAQ:EXPE) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 11% in that time. But at least the stock is up over the last three years. Arguably you'd have been better off buying an index fund, because the gain of 24% in three years isn't amazing.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Expedia Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Expedia Group moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Expedia Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Expedia Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 22%, against a market gain of about 6.9%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 3% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Expedia Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value stocks and their past performance, and go directly to read 5 Cheap Dividend Stocks With High Yields. The Importance of Investing in Undervalued/Cheap StocksInvesting in value stocks is one of the most popular methods to make money through the stock market. Value strategy involves discovering cheap stocks trading below their intrinsic value and investing in them, expecting them to eventually rise to their accurate value. As the market recognizes the true value of these stocks over time, value investors aim to generate long-term capital appreciation through them. These stocks usually have low price-to-earnings ratios.Over the years, there have been periods where either value or growth stocks have outperformed the other. Their performance has widely depended on various market conditions and investor sentiment. Historical analysis shows that value stocks performed better than growth equities during periods of high-interest rates and inflation. Franklin Templeton published a report on value stocks and highlighted that due to high-interest rates across the world last year, value equities surpassed growth stocks in global markets. The report further mentioned that trailing earnings per share of value companies have grown strongly over the last decade. So far in 2023, growth stocks have reasserted their dominance over value stocks.When analyzing the performance of both value and growth stocks, research has shown that value investing is a reliable strategy for long-term investors. One such study was conducted by Eugene Fama and Ken French and published by Dimensional Fund Advisors. The study cited that value stocks have surpassed their growth counterparts by 4.1% annually in the US from 1927 to 2021. This shows that value investing can be suitable for long-term investors, and is, therefore, one of the most preferred investment options for them.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Small-Cap Value Stocks to Invest InIn addition to their long-term results, many value stocks come from established companies with stable earnings and a history of paying dividends.

Dividend companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc.

The firm also highlighted that the company's performance remained stable following the Silicon Valley Bank fallout.Madison Investments mentioned U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shares are ensnared in the bank-run panic that began late in the quarter. Two large banks failed in early March as depositors rushed to withdraw money on concerns that the banks would suffer from liquidity problems. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, but in the case of the two banks, it was prompted by the revelations of utter mismanagement of their securities portfolio. Bank models are, essentially, to borrow short and lend long. This sounds dangerous of course, and it would be if not for the deposit guarantee provided by the FDIC. The history of the U.S. banking system can be divided into two eras – pre-FDIC, when bank runs were fairly common, and post-FDIC, when bank runs have been close to non-existent. However, FDIC protection has its limits, and it remains incumbent on management to properly manage its assets and liabilities. The two banks in question didn’t do that. By taking down the share prices of all banks, we think investors are shooting first and asking questions later; they are not distinguishing between the strong and the weak.U.S. Bancorp, as one of the largest and best-managed banks in the country, appears to be a net beneficiary so far of the panic among some depositors, with a pick-up in net deposit inflows in recent weeks. We don’t dismiss the probability of industry contagion – in a true nationwide panic, the big banks will suffer along with the small banks, and the well-managed ones will suffer along with the badly-managed ones. But we think the odds of that are quite small, and recent steps by federal regulators confirm that they will do everything in their power to prevent such a scenario, given the calamitous impact that it would have on our economy. We tightly manage this risk by limiting our exposure to the banking sector.”6. Northrim BanCorp, Inc.

These stocks, aka the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (or DJIA), represent 30 of America’s largest, most venerable companies, across multiple sectors. There are a total of 30 Dow components, but instead of buying the whole bunch, you may want to focus on what could be some of the strongest individual opportunities within the index.While few stocks that make up the DJIA can be classified as overvalued, there are few names that sport more-than-reasonable valuations at current prices. These names, all arguably oversold as of late, make for great long-term stocks to buy on the dip.Although in the near-term they may continue to trade sideways, or even move slightly lower, between the strength of their underlying businesses, plus a track record of dividends and dividend growth, each of these Dow stocks to buy could produce steady long-term returns for your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmerican Express (AXP)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks to buySource: ShutterstockAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a blue chip stock that needs little introduction. The financial services firm, best known for its charge and credit card products, has long been regarded as a high-quality stock, representing ownership in a business with a deep competitive moat.In recent months, however, investors have turned bearish on AXP stock. This sell-off in financial stocks due to the banking crisis has played a role, but a negative reaction to the company’s latest earnings report has also been a big factor. However, current sentiment for AXP works in the favor of long-term investors.Once concerns about the potential fallout from the current economic slowdown pass, shares could start bouncing back to past highs. Alongside appreciation potential, this stock (trading for a more-than-fair 15.6 times earnings) pays a dividend of 1.62%, and AXP’s rate of payout has tripled over the past decade.Story continuesCaterpillar (CAT)Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockEarlier this month, I called Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) one of the best dividend stocks to buy. However, it’s not only “dividend aristocrat” status and a 2.32% dividend yield that make shares in this construction and mining equipment maker a buy.CAT’s post-earnings slide since April makes it one of the best Dow stocks to buy on the dip. Not only has this pullback resulted in CAT stock now sporting an even higher forward yield. Shares have also fallen to a valuation of around 15.3 times earnings.Sure, on the surface that may sound pricey, or at best, a fair-price for CAT. Even so, keep in mind that sell-side forecasts call for earnings per share to rise from $12.64 in 2022, to over $20 per share by 2025. This earnings may enable Caterpillar to sustain, and add to, its current valuation over the next few years.Walt Disney (DIS)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is another one of the Dow stocks hit hard this latest earnings season. For the preceding quarter, the media conglomerate reported year-over-year revenue growth of 13%, and a big rebound in non-GAAP earnings.However, investors were not pleased to hear about falling subscriber numbers for the company’s Disney+ streaming platform. This news has sent DIS stock around 10% lower since the earnings release on May 10.  Nevertheless, this post-earnings weakness may make it one of the stocks to buy on the dip.As a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, “short-term pain” could pave the way for “long-term gain.” Why? This unexpected drop in subscribers is far outweighed by higher subscription fees and reduced operating costs. Analysts forecast that Disney’s turnaround could push annual earnings to $6.58 per share by 2025. Not too shabby, given you buy DIS today for $91 per share.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the epitome of blue chip stock. Operating in a resilient sector (healthcare), the company has a long track record of profitability and dividend growth. JNJ has raised its rate of payout 60 years in a row, making it one of the top “dividend kings.”Despite these strengths, JNJ stock has delivered a more mixed performance recently. Earlier this year, concerns about the company’s talcum powder cancer lawsuits resulted in an extended slide for shares. In April, the stock bolted higher upon news of an $8.9 billion settlement of these claims.However, bullishness about the settlement, as well as about its planned spinoff of Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) has waned. Yet while frustrating for existing investors, recent short-term hiccups enable new investors to scoop up JNJ at an attractive entry point. The stock trades for just 15 times earnings, and sports a nearly 3% dividend yield.JP Morgan (JPM)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockPlenty of analysts and commentators have stated that JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) will emerge as a “winner” (for lack of a better word) as a result of this year’s banking crisis. Back in April, I dove into the hype and facts surrounding this argument.My conclusion? While conceding that this big bank faces some of the same risks that caused numerous regional banks to fail (unrealized loan losses), explaining its pullback due to the crisis, I argued that JPM stock was trading at a historically-low valuation.Flash forward to now. JPM still trades below pre-crisis price levels. Yet while the bank doesn’t appear set to further capitalize on the crisis, a big rebound may be in store, once this crisis, plus other headwinds (such as with commercial real estate loans) clear up. While waiting for a comeback to take shape, you can receive a steady return, via JPM’s 3% dividend.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Source: ShutterstockIf capital compounding is one of your investment objectives, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best Dow stocks to buy. Shares in the healthcare company are up 678% over the past decade. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t think shares can rise by another 678% between now and 2033.However, UNH stock could still deliver outsized returns. As I have discussed in past coverage of this stock, UNH’s fast-growing Optum care and prescription benefits unit could enable the company to continue delivering above-average earnings growth.This more-than-justifies the stock’s current forward valuation of 19.2 times earnings. Better yet, instead of merely rising in tandem with increased earnings, UnitedHealth Group shares could benefit from multiple expansion. To top things off, UNH’s fast-growing dividend (which has grown by an average 17.1% annually over the past five years) may provide an additional boost to long-term total returns.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the “Dogs of the Dow,”  but many investors may also consider it one of the biggest dividend/value traps within the index. Shares in the pharmacy giant sport a 6.12% dividend yield.This may seem enticing to income-focused investors, yet this high payout has been far outweighed by steady price declines for WBA stock in recent years. So then, why do I consider it one of the best Dow stocks to buy today?Despite a lackluster performance since the late 2010s, a much-awaited recovery for the stock may be in store. Possibly in the early stages of a turnaround, if the company can continue to improve its fiscal performance, shares could be poised to make a big comeback. You can buy WBA today for just 7 times forward earnings, suggesting big upside in the event sentiment for the stock improves.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Not only do these dividend stocks pay a healthy and consistent yield, many of these names trade quite well too.A number of growth stocks are still 40% to 50%, or more, below their all-time highs. At the same time, there are a handful of dividend stocks that are not just hitting 52-week highs, but that are hitting all-time highs despite the difficult market environment.Admittedly, these holdings tend to lag the market during the last gasp of the bull market, but I think both growth and income-oriented investors could use a little variety in their portfolios.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s step back and take a closer look at a few reliable dividend stocks to buy. Some will be at or near their highs, while others will be on a discount.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has to be one of the best bargains out there when it comes to reliable dividend stocks.There are a number of dividend stocks that trade at a low valuation. However, they also tend to come with negative or no growth and are generally priced at a discount for a reason. That’s not to say J&amp;J is perfect by any means, but this is a very well-run and consistent firm.First, shares pay out a 3% dividend yield at current prices. While that’s not earth-shattering, it’s a solid yield. Second, the company has not only paid but has raised its dividend for 61 consecutive years.For more than six decades now, the company has annually increased its payout. That’s through wars, recessions, periods of high inflation and company-specific incidents, like the Tylenol tampering incidents and recall.For this, investors are paying just 15x earnings, even as analysts expect mid-single-digit earnings and revenue growth this year.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockStory continuesThere is a caveat with Realty Income (NYSE:O), which is that not every investor is comfortable with REITs. Even companies as consistent as Realty Income, better known as “O stock,” can bring a degree of unknown to investors.So what’s this caveat?The caveat is risk. A recession will weigh on the company’s stock price, not only because the overall market will likely be under pressure, but because REITs in general will struggle. Higher interest rates can be a headwind and worries over the commercial real estate market persist.Realty Income certainly isn’t the most exciting stock in the market, but it’s remarkably consistent. First it pays its dividend monthly, not quarterly, and  it has raised that dividend for 102 consecutive quarters. In other words, rather than one annual increase a year, Realty Income gives investors a modest raise four times a year.That quarterly raise has been going on for more than 25 years! For that, any investor could benefit from putting this name in a long-term portfolio.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockLast but not least, we have McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). While Realty Income is muddling along and J&amp;J stock is far from thriving, McDonald’s stock is hitting all-time highs. Shares are up 12% this year, 20% over the past 12 months and 70% over the last three years. All three measures top the S&amp;P 500.As a result of the stock’s strong performance, the dividend yield sits just under 2.1%. That brings up the old debate stock performance vs. dividend income.While many would hesitate to call McDonald’s a growth stock, its performance is hard to criticize. That said, it’s one of the reliable dividend stocks any investor could put in their portfolio.The firm has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years, while analysts expect 9% to 10% earnings growth this year and next year.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in JNJ.

However, no one seems to be talking about healthcare stocks to buy.That said, I get it.Semiconductor stocks and AI stocks are the exciting plays in the market, while mega-cap tech is powering the S&amp;P 500 higher. In fact, just a handful of names have driven almost all of the year-to-date gains in the index.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile these stocks are dominating the headlines, there are other groups that are pushing 52-week, and in some cases all-time, highs. In some instances, those are defensive consumer names, like PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD).Even more quietly though, it’s been health stocks.These secular stocks continue to chug higher despite what many consider to be lousy price action from the broader market. The earnings have been pretty good too. In that light, I want to look at a few healthcare stocks hitting new highs.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/Michael ViEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) jumps right to the front of the line. That’s as shares have rallied more than 44% from the March low and have climbed in 9 straight weeks. The rally has been robust as shares have exploded over the prior all-time high near $375.Interestingly, amid the move was a not-so-hot quarterly report.The firm reported earnings of $1.62 a share, missing estimates by 11 cents, while revenue slumped more than 10% year-over-year. It didn’t matter though, because management provided strong guidance and the report helped ignite the latest portion of the current rally.Positive news surrounding its tirzepatide weight-loss therapy and Jaypirca treatment, which is used to treat a type of blood cancer, also helped give the stock a boost.The stock now quietly sports a market capitalization north of $400 billion and will surely be on investors’ radar to buy on the dip.Cardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of itSource: ShutterstockStory continuesAdd Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) to the relative strength list as it hits fresh 52-week highs. Another 7% rally from here will vault the stock to all-time highs, as well. This one has been an earnings machine, as it continues to impress investors.In early February it delivered robust results and strong guidance. In early May, management followed up with another top-line and bottom-line beat as sales of $50.5 billion soared past expectations by almost $1 billion.Management lifted its full-year earnings outlook and its full-year free cash flow expectations too.Analysts expect about 13% earnings growth this year and roughly the same growth next year. That’s even as revenue growth is forecast to decelerate to about 6.5% in 2024, down from 12.5% this year. With a dividend yield of about 2.5% and a stock trading at less than 13.5 times next year’s earnings estimates, this is one of several healthcare stocks to buy that investors will be watching.Merck (MRK)Source: ShutterstockLike Eli Lilly, Merck (NYSE:MRK) has quietly amassed a market cap of nearly $300 billion. Like Cardinal Health, the stock also pays out a dividend yield of about 2.5% and has a reasonable valuation, trading at about 16.5 times this year’s earnings. Finally, Merck is fresh off all-time highs, as well.Despite those observations, shares are up just 4.5% so far in 2023. Although, it’s up almost 30% in the past 12 months.There’s good news and bad news with this stock. On the plus side, it recently delivered strong earnings with a raised and narrowed full-year outlook. Further, estimates for 2024 are encouraging, calling for 6.3% revenue growth and 21% earnings growth.On the downside, analysts call for a 1% revenue dip and a 6.7% earnings contraction in 2023. If Merck can deliver better-than-expected results while keeping investors excited about 2024, this stock could have more room to run.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:ROK) Maintain Its Strong Returns?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-inc-nyse-rok-130425309.html,1684674265,STORY,['ROK'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Rockwell Automation is:38% = US$1.3b ÷ US$3.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.38.Does Rockwell Automation Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Rockwell Automation has a superior ROE than the average (14%) in the Electrical industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Rockwell Automation visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Rockwell Automation's Debt And Its 38% Return On EquityRockwell Automation does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.16. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Rockwell Automation may not be the best stock to buy.

However, he was not sure if they would hit the 20% to 30% range competitors are forecasting.""If traffic is growing by 10%, we aim to deliver that type of profit growth as well. It could be better than that if our competitors are correct,"" O'Leary said on an analyst call.""30 years of pain in this industry has taught me to be cautious when my competitors are irrationally exuberant.""Ryanair shares, up 27% so far this year, were 2.5% higher by 1145 GMT.The low cost carrier stands to gain more from rising fares due to plans to operate 25% more flights than pre-COVID levels in the peak summer months when European short-haul capacity is set to be 5-10% below pre-pandemic levels.O'Leary cautioned that he was not entirely sure if demand would remain strong with consumer spending strained and that winter and early 2024 may be more challenging.However, a large backlog of aircraft deliveries is likely to constrain European capacity growth for at least four more years and create ""enormous growth opportunities"" for Ryanair as it adds 110 new Boeing jets over the next three summers.Story continuesBoeing delivery delays could push some of its growth into the lower yielding second half of this year and require capacity to be trimmed judiciously, he said, with the carrier expecting to be short of up to 10 new jets in June and July.Finance chief Neil Sorahan told Reuters that the Irish airline remained comfortable it would increase passenger numbers to 185 million from a record 168.6 million in the past financial year.The delivery delays could potentially reduce first-half passenger numbers by 750,000, he said.O'Leary expects all the aircraft needed for summer 2024 to arrive by the end of next May or early June and that deliveries will be ""smoother"" next summer.Ryanair's full-year post-tax profit beat the 1.4 billion euros analysts expected, as well as its own forecasts and almost topped the record 1.45 billion euros achieved in 2018.

It could be better than that if our competitors are correct,"" O'Leary said on an analyst call.""30 years of pain in this industry has taught me to be cautious when my competitors are irrationally exuberant.""Ryanair shares, up 27% so far this year, were 2.5% higher by 1145 GMT.The low cost carrier stands to gain more from rising fares due to plans to operate 25% more flights than pre-COVID levels in the peak summer months when European short-haul capacity is set to be 5-10% below pre-pandemic levels.O'Leary cautioned that he was not entirely sure if demand would remain strong with consumer spending strained and that winter and early 2024 may be more challenging.However, a large backlog of aircraft deliveries is likely to constrain European capacity growth for at least four more years and create ""enormous growth opportunities"" for Ryanair as it adds 110 new Boeing jets over the next three summers.Boeing delivery delays could push some of its growth into the lower yielding second half of this year and require capacity to be trimmed judiciously, he said, with the carrier expecting to be short of up to 10 new jets in June and July.Story continuesFinance chief Neil Sorahan told Reuters that the Irish airline remained comfortable it would increase passenger numbers to 185 million from a record 168.6 million in the past financial year.The delivery delays could potentially reduce first-half passenger numbers by 750,000, he said.O'Leary expects all the aircraft needed for summer 2024 to arrive by the end of next May or early June and that deliveries will be ""smoother"" next summer.Ryanair's full-year post-tax profit beat the 1.4 billion euros analysts expected, as well as its own forecasts and almost topped the record 1.45 billion euros achieved in 2018. It said a large chunk was due to being ""fortuitously"" hedged on fuel cost.The company made a loss of 355 million euros in last year's pandemic-hit financial year but its turnaround.($1 = 0.9084 euros)(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, David Goodman and Alexander Smith)]"

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Boeing Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.79bUS$7.23bUS$10.1bUS$10.9bUS$12.2bUS$13.1bUS$13.8bUS$14.5bUS$15.0bUS$15.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 7.40%Est @ 5.81%Est @ 4.70%Est @ 3.92%Est @ 3.38% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$3.5kUS$6.2kUS$8.0kUS$8.1kUS$8.4kUS$8.3kUS$8.2kUS$7.9kUS$7.6kUS$7.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$74bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.1%) = US$279bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$279b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$132bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$205b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$205, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boeing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.958. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for BoeingStrengthNo major strengths identified for BA.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Boeing, we've compiled three relevant factors you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - Boeing has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for BA's future outlook?

With the world’s largest governments tremendously backing the switch to renewable energy and the electric-vehicle revolution greatly increasing the electricity demand, it was obvious to me that the best renewable names would be very high-reward stocks.Earlier this year, my belief in that thesis increased. That’s because one of the world’s most successful investors, multi-billionaire Steve Cohen, revealed that he had acquired large stakes in two solar energy companies —SunRun (NASDAQ:RUN) and SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG).And interestingly, according to fintel.io, many large institutional investors have also recently acquired stakes in another solar energy company, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR). For example, on May 15, Royal London Asset Management reported that it had acquired nearly 35,000 shares of FSLR in the first quarter. Also on May 15, AllianceBernstein reported that it had bought 40,655 shares of FSLR in Q1. And finally, also on May 15, Morgan Stanley reported that it had bought 186,110 shares of SEDG in Q1.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese purchases have also greatly increased my confidence in renewable energy stocks in general and solar energy names in particular.Green Energy Stocks: First Solar (FSLR)First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comFirst Solar received good news on May 12 as the Treasury Department ruled that many components of solar panels must be manufactured in the U.S. in order to qualify for America’s new 30% tax credit, Piper Sandler explained on May 12, according to The Fly.First Solar already has two solar panel plants in Ohio and is almost done building another one there while developing a fourth plant in Alabama. Consequently, it is well-positioned to benefit significantly from Treasury’s stringent requirements.Story continuesAdditionally, FSLR acquired Swedish solar research company Evolar on May 12. According to FSLR, the deal “should speed up [its] development of next-generation solar technology, including highly efficient tandem devices,” Investor’s Business Daily reported.Maxeon (MAXN)An image of solar panels with cityscape of a modern cityMaxeon (NASDAQ:MAXN) is a China-based solar panel maker.  Investor’s Business Daily gives MAXN stock a relatively high Composite Rating of 80 out of 99 and a maximum Relative Score rating of 99, showing that the stock has performed extremely well over the past year.After the company reported higher-than-expected first-quarter earnings per share, Bank of America wrote that the earnings “proved that the execution trend that started last quarter is not a one-off,” The bank expects the company’s 2023 results to surpass increased expectations, and it kept a “buy” rating on the shares.Also upbeat on Maxeon in the wake of its Q1 results was investment bank Raymond James. The bank is bullish on MAXN due to its large exposure to the rapidly growing European solar sector.Additionally, Raymond James believes that the market is giving the shares barely any credit for the company’s intention to open factories in the U.S. to get a lift from U.S. manufacturing tax credits. Raymond James maintained an “outperform” rating on the shares. That makes it one of the best green energy stocks in my book.Quanta Services (PWR)Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buySource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.comQuanta (NYSE:PWR) provides “infrastructure solutions” to companies. PWR is benefiting financially from its assistance with the development of renewable energy plants and facilities.For example, PWR is helping to build what it says is “the world’s largest lithium-ion battery installation” near a “wind farm” in Australia. The company is also providing “engineering, procurement, and construction” services for SunZia Wind, “which Elektrek calls “the largest wind project in the Western Hemisphere.” The project is located in New Mexico.Quanta is also benefiting from the electric-vehicle revolution, as the company recently launched a partnership with truck maker Navistar to provide the infrastructure needed for large companies to adopt EVs. Quanta will provide “site construction and utility work” to the firms.Although PWR is not one of the traditional renewable energy stocks, I believe that it is benefiting a great deal from the energy transition and that its future is consequently very bright.SolarEdge (SEDG)the solar edge logo on an iPhone. SEDG stockSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSolarEdge, which makes equipment used in solar projects, reported very strong first-quarter results on May 3, as its revenue jumped 44% year-over-year and its operating income climbed to $144.2 million from $50.9 million during the same period a year earlier.“Our diverse geographic and segmental footprint enables us to continue to grow revenues without being overly dependent on any single market or segment. As we see supply chain challenges gradually improving, we remain focused on execution and efficiencies to drive up margins and profitability.” CEO Zvi Lando said in a statement.As I noted in the introduction, Morgan Stanley on May 15 reported that it had bought 186,110 shares of SEDG in Q1. Also on May 15, T. Rowe Price reported that it had bought a huge 371,509 shares of SEDG stock in Q1, according to fintel.io.Given SolarEdge’s rapid growth, its 31.75x forward price-earnings ratio is quite attractive. Thus, it is one of the top green energy stocks to buy.Darling Ingredients (DAR)Darling Ingredients (DAR) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comDarling (NYSE:DAR) noted that it had launched its third renewable diesel plant last quarter. As a result, the company’s joint venture with Valero (NYSE:VLO),  Diamond Green Diesel, has become “North America’s largest renewable diesel producer at 1.2 billion gallons a year,” Darling reported.Also noteworthy is that, according to Darling’s statement on its Q1 earnings call, California is considering imposing an obligation for airlines that fly to the state to use low-carbon fuel in the future. If implemented, that should help Darling significantly, since the company is converting one of its renewable diesel facilities to a plat that produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF. Diamond Green Diesel is expected to start producing SAF in 2025.“Our focus has been on converting part of our processing capacity to SAF because we think that’s the higher value, higher-margin area,” explained Chief Strategy Officer John Bullock.Given Darling’s huge opportunity in SAF, its forward price-earnings ratio of 11.5x is very attractive.Canadian Solar (CSIQ)A Canadian Solar (CSIQ) display booth at a convention in Bangkok, Thailand.Source: Shutter B Photo / Shutterstock.comCanadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) is a solar panel maker that produces most of its panels in China. The company has an annual solar module capacity of 75 gigawatts, making it one of the world’s largest producers of solar panels. It sells most of its panels to utilities, making it less vulnerable than some of its competitors to changes in governments’ policies vis-a-vis incentives for consumers’ rooftop solar systems.Impressively, in the fourth quarter of last year, the company’s net income “nearly tripled to $77.8 million.”In February Wells Fargo increased its price target on CSIQ stock to $46 from $33. The firm became more positive on the outlook of CSIQ due to “the recent drop in polysilicon prices, a potential U.S. capacity expansion, and” the high level of certainty of the outlook of its shipments in 2023 and 2024, The Fly reported.The forward price-earnings of CSIQ stock is also a tiny 6.9x, making it among the most undervalued green energy stocks.Array Technologies (ARRY)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockArray (NASDAQ:ARRY) “manufactures and sells ground-mounting tracking systems used in solar energy projects.”On May 9, the company reported very good first-quarter results, as its revenue climbed 25% year-over-year to $377 million and its EBITDA, excluding certain items, climbed an impressive $66.2 million year-over-year to $67 million, while it generated $41.9 million of free cash flow.Going forward, the company expects its financial results to be further boosted by new U.S. tax credits for solar manufacturers.Investor’s Business Daily gives ARRY a Composite Rating of 98 out of 99 and an RS rating of 97 out of 98, indicating that the stock has been very popular in the last year.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of  MAXN and DAR.  He may buy shares of ARRY this week.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsA dire warning for commercial real estateCarroll is not the first — and certainly won’t be the last — to ring the warning bell for the commercial real estate sector.Since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, experts have raised concerns about the mega $1.5 trillion wall of debt looming for U.S. commercial properties.That mortgage debt — which is held mostly by small- and medium-sized banks — comes due for repayment before the end of 2025.“No lender is willing to lend because they don’t know where interest rates are going,” Carroll said.Carroll added offices are experiencing “a double whammy” of misery and he described the sector’s fundamentals as “terrible.”“After COVID, people worked from home. The work week is now Tuesday to Thursday — so, people are taking less office space, no one wants to lend on it … it’s a disaster,” he said.Real estate safe haven?According to Carroll, there is one real estate niche that is riding out this wave: multi-family real estate.In contrast to commercial real estate, the multi-family market has “strong fundamentals,” says Carroll, whose real estate investment firm manages more than 33,000 multi-family units across nine states.Story continues“I talked to one of the biggest landlords in the world yesterday and what he’s telling everybody is: ‘Stay alive ‘til ‘25.’ Right now, our fundamentals are great, people are paying rents [and] the market is healthy,” he said.Read more: * Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.In recent years, inflation has consistently exceeded the Federal Reserve's target of 2% amid increased prices in commodities such as oil, copper, soybeans, and corn, reported. According to Wells Fargo Advisors weekly market commentary, this rise in commodity prices directly impacts average Americans, as they regularly encounter higher costs at the gas pump and grocery stores. Consumer sentiment is often influenced by gasoline prices, especially when they are on the rise. In the past few decades, as inflation and interest rates decreased from their peak levels in the early 1980s, the Federal Reserve has primarily focused on ""core"" inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. The rationale behind this approach is that monetary policy has limited influence over food and energy prices. Grain prices are influenced by various factors, including weather conditions in different regions around the world, making them less responsive to interest rate adjustments or changes in the money supply. Similarly, the oil market has often been subject to the impact of natural events like hurricanes, which can disrupt production and affect prices. Hence, monetary policy decisions have limited influence on natural phenomena. However, the demand for oil and gasoline is directly tied to economic expansions and contractions, which are influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions and the market's perception of their impact on demand. For instance, the recent decline in oil prices can be attributed, in part, to market expectations of a global economic slowdown and a potential recession in many developed countries. China's slower-than-anticipated recovery has also contributed to the downward pressure on oil prices and other commodities. According to Bloomberg, markets are experiencing anxiety due to concerns that leaders in Washington may not be able to prevent a historic default before the June 1 deadline. This uncertainty is unsettling investors and impacting market sentiment. As a result, yields across the US Treasury curve increased on May 16. Specifically, the yield on 30-year notes reached approximately 3.9%, marking its highest level since the regional bank turmoil in early March. The rising yields indicate that investors demand higher returns as they perceive an increased risk in holding long-term US government debt.Story continuesThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) were among the notable stocks that analysts recently downgraded. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) was downgraded primarily due to concerns about the slow recovery in China and the travel retail segment in Asia, where inventories are increasing. At the same time, ratings for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) were cut due to the deterioration of the company's outlook for direct-to-consumer subscribers and linear TV. Check out the complete article to see the details of these downgrades.Analysts Are Downgrading These StocksPixabay/Public Domain10. Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 7Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) is a Georgia-based home care platform company offering private duty nursing, adult home health and hospice, and home-based pediatric therapy in the United States.On May 12, Raymond James lowered its rating on Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) from Strong Buy to Market Perform without providing a specific price target. According to the analyst's research note, although Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) Q1 results surpassed expectations, the company's performance still falls short of the necessary levels to maintain its equity value. The firm highlights that Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) metrics continue to pose high risks, particularly with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 11.1 times. Additionally, there is limited visibility regarding the substantial improvement in EBITDA required to establish an adequate margin of error, as stated by the analyst.09. SJW Group (NYSE:SJW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) provides water utility services in the United States. It specializes in the production, purchase, storage, purification, distribution, wholesale, and retail sale of water and wastewater services.Wells Fargo revised its rating on SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) from Equal Weight to Underweight on May 12 while maintaining an unchanged price target of $76. According to the analyst's research note, SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) shares are trading at valuation multiples similar to larger water utility companies. However, the analyst believes a slight discount would be more appropriate given the stock's ongoing ""show me"" narrative, accompanied by regulatory uncertainties that have not yet been fully resolved. The analyst also mentions that SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) management is rebuilding investor confidence following strategic missteps. As a result, Wells Fargo predicts that SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) shares will offer one of the lowest potential total returns among the five water utilities it covers over the next 12-18 months.08. Stantec Inc. (NYSE:STN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13According to Raymond James analyst Frederic Bastien's research note, Stantec Inc. (NYSE:STN) rating has been downgraded from Strong Buy to Outperform. However, the price target remains at C$90. The analyst stated on May 12 that Stantec's shares have already exhibited strong performance, which aligns with the firm's belief that the market can no longer overlook the company's improving and consistently positive performance, noteworthy ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) attributes, and promising future. This downgrade suggests that while the analyst still considers Stantec Inc. (NYSE:STN) attractive, the previous ""Strong Buy"" recommendation has been adjusted to an ""Outperform"" rating.07. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), an alcoholic beverage company based in London, is the owner of several distilleries. The company is responsible for manufacturing a majority of the total production of Scotch whisky and boasts a portfolio of over 24 brands, including Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B, and Vat 69.On May 12, in a research note, Jefferies downgraded Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) from Buy to Hold and reduced the price target from $200 to $190. The analyst explains that the downgrade results from a less optimistic short-term outlook for Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) primary market, the United States. The firm anticipates a normalization of industry growth following the extraordinary period during the pandemic and potential risks associated with inventory realignment in a slower macroeconomic environment. Recent data suggest a deceleration in growth within the U.S. market, prompting Jefferies to revise its recommendation.Here is what ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy has to say about Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Diageo is a leading global distiller and brewer which addresses the large ($500 billion-plus) and fragmented market for spirits. With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”06. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is a news, sports, and entertainment company. Fox Corporation Class A (NASDAQ:FOXA) shares carry additional voting rights compared to the regular common shares of Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX). Essentially, FOXA shares give shareholders more influence over the company's decision-making processes.Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall downgraded Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) from Overweight to Equal Weight on May 12, with a lowered price target of $35 (previously $44). The analyst explains that the firm had a positive outlook on Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) when its EBITDA was growing, the potential of sports betting appeared promising, and its balance sheet seemed appealing in the context of rising interest rates. However, looking ahead, the analyst finds fewer reasons for excitement and believes there are diminished prospects for the company.Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy NowWarren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

A 100,000-qubit system would serve as a foundation to address some of the world's most pressing problems that even the most advanced supercomputers of today may never be able to solve.For example, such a powerful quantum system could unlock entirely new understandings of chemical reactions and the dynamics of molecular processes. In turn, this could enable researchers to help study climate change through modeling better methods to capture carbon; discover materials to build batteries for electric vehicles and energy grids towards the goal of being cleaner and more sustainable; and uncover more effective and energy-efficient fertilizers.To usher in this powerful new paradigm, a global collaboration and an activation of talent and resources across industries and research institutions is being initiated. By partnering with the University of Chicago, the University of Tokyo, and IBM's broader global ecosystem, IBM will work over the next decade to advance the underlying technologies for this system, as well as to design and build the necessary components at scale.Moving forward, IBM intends to expand these partnerships to include Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory, both of which are members of the Chicago Quantum Exchange and home to two respective Department of Energy quantum hubs. Importantly, the two laboratories offer capabilities and expertise that can facilitate delivering the technologies envisaged in the race to build a quantum-centric supercomputer.Story continues""Over the past several years, IBM has been at the forefront of introducing quantum technology to the world,"" said Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM. ""We have achieved significant progress along our roadmap and mission to globally establish useful quantum technology, so much so that we can now, with our partners, truly begin to explore and develop a new class of supercomputing anchored by quantum.""""Achieving breakthroughs at scale in quantum technology requires deeply rooted and productive collaboration around the world and across a broad range of industry, academic, and government partners,"" said Paul Alivisatos, President of the University of Chicago. ""Quantum information science and technology is at a crossroad where foundational discovery and technical innovation will combine to create real breakthroughs. The University of Chicago is thrilled to partner in this endeavor.""""We expect our partnership will lead to scientific breakthroughs, acceleration of the adoption of quantum computing for the coming era, and active engagement into the critical societal challenges of humanity. We also aim to contribute to the realization of a better future society by nurturing diverse talents,"" said Dr. Teruo Fujii, the President of the University of Tokyo.Building the Blocks of Quantum-Centric SupercomputingThe plans for this quantum-centric supercomputer are expected to involve innovations at all levels of the computing stack, and encompass the convergence of the fields of quantum computing and quantum communication, as well as the seamless integration of quantum and classical workflows via the hybrid cloud.Because such a computer has never been made before, the first step will be to lay out a blueprint. The design will have to integrate classical computers and quantum computers – a challenging task to date – as well as break new ground in quantum communication and computing technology.The foundation of this system will include milestones IBM has already outlined on its Quantum Development Roadmap. This includes the ability to scale and connect growing numbers of quantum processors through quantum interconnects, as well as technology to mitigate errors to fully harness noisy yet powerful quantum processors.By the end of 2023, IBM intends to debut three cornerstones of its necessary architecture for quantum-centric supercomputers. One is the new 133-qubit 'IBM Heron' processor. This processor is a complete redesign of IBM's previous generations of quantum processors, with a new two-qubit gate to allow higher performance. It will also be compatible with future extensions to enable modular connected processors to grow the size of the computer.The second is the introduction of IBM Quantum System Two. The new flagship system is designed to be modular and flexible to introduce elements of scaling in its underlying components, including classical control electronics and high-density cryogenic wiring infrastructure. This system is targeted to be online by the end of 2023.The third is the introduction of middleware for quantum, a set of tools to run workloads on both classical and quantum processors. This includes tools for decomposing, parallel execution, and reconstructing workloads to enable efficient solutions at scale.Over the next decade, IBM plans to work with university partners and its worldwide quantum ecosystem to evolve how its quantum processors can be connected via quantum interconnects. This work will aim to enable high-efficiency, high-fidelity inter-processor quantum operations and a reliable, flexible, and affordable system component infrastructure to allow scaling to 100,000 qubits.IBM's collaboration with the University of Chicago will build upon the Chicago area's strengths in quantum research. The University of Chicago seeded the region's quantum ecosystem more than a decade ago with the decision to make quantum technology a focus of what is now the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. Chicago has arguably become one of the leading global hubs for research in quantum technology and home to one of the largest quantum networks in the country. Scientists from the University of Chicago-headquartered Chicago Quantum Exchange, which includes Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory, four universities, more than 40 industry partners, and researchers at other world-class academic institutions in the region will continue to expand the understanding and utilization of quantum technology.In conjunction with IBM, researchers at the University of Tokyo have been pushing forward on topics such as the detailed analysis of noise deep inside quantum processors, the development of efficient computation for quantum artificial intelligence, and quantum chemistry simulation with classical-quantum hybrid computations.For more about the path to a 100,000-qubit quantum-centric supercomputer, read the IBM Research blog.Statements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice and represent goals and objectives only.About IBM IBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

For retirees, dividend payments can help replace employment earnings and supplement pension income. For these reasons, many investors seek out income from stocks that pay high dividends on a consistent basis. The best dividend stocks are known as the “Dividend Aristocrats,” a select group of companies that have raised their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years.Dividend Aristocrats are a rare breed. There are only 68 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index that have hiked their payout to shareholders for a quarter century without missing a year. Many companies end up suspending or reducing their dividend payments during difficult economic times.So, for investors who count on passive income from their investments, Dividend Aristocrats can serve as a financial lifeline.

The company known for making Scotch tape and Post-It notes has seen its share price fall 33% over the past 12 months, including a 16.5% decline so far in 2023.Has the stock bottomed?It’s difficult to say. But with a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6 and a market capitalization of $55.3 billion, MMM stock looks cheap right now. Plus, the stock currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.50 a share, which equates to a sky-high yield of 6%.In fact, 3M’s dividend is one of the highest among companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 index, making it an extremely attractive option for investors seeking to generate income.3M also has one of the best track records of any company when it comes to paying a dividend. Founded in 1902, 3M has paid dividends to its shareholders for more than 100 years, and it has raised its dividend for 64 consecutive years. That actually makes MMM stock a “Dividend King” and places it in the highest order of dividend aristocrats.Story continuesIBM (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comShares of Big Blue are down 11% on the year and trading less than 9% above their 52-week low. The technology giant’s stock continues its long-term trend of underperformance, with its share price down 9% over the past five years.While disappointing, IBM (NYSE:IBM) shareholders can comfort themselves with a quarterly dividend payment of $1.66 per share, which gives it a yield of 5.4%, among the highest of any tech stock.Despite struggling through years-long restructurings and multiple turnaround strategies, IBM has managed to continue growing its dividend. The company has raised its payout for 28 consecutive years.The dividend is viewed as safe given the company’s strong cash flow generation and should be considered a reward to shareholders who have stuck with IBM stock over the years despite its lagging performance.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is another company whose stock is sitting near its 52-week low.

The company has increased its dividend payout to shareholders for 47 years in a row.Walgreen’s high dividend yield makes it one of the “Dogs of the Dow,” a select group of the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow 30 index.

84,cb65fec6-ce61-36d1-828e-aebfc19b1d83,TAP,2023-05-22,Is Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) Potentially Undervalued?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/molson-coors-beverage-company-nyse-110648224.html,1684753608,STORY,['TAP-A'],"[Let's talk about the popular Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Molson Coors Beverage’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage What Is Molson Coors Beverage Worth?Great news for investors – Molson Coors Beverage is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $103.33, but it is currently trading at US$62.61 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that Molson Coors Beverage’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Molson Coors Beverage generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted revenue growth of 4.8% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Molson Coors Beverage, at least in the short term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since TAP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TAP for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TAP. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

86,92e5985c-f528-3ebb-8be6-cdc2a2b6b572,PNC,2023-05-22,7 Bank Stocks That Desperately Need Warren Buffett’s Help,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-bank-stocks-desperately-warren-113001034.html,1684409401,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB', 'BRK-A', 'ALLY', 'GS', 'SCHW', 'PNC', 'BRK-B', 'TFC', 'CMA', 'STT']","[As the banking crisis persists, bank stocks continue to trade at depressed prices. With this, many investors are waiting for Warren Buffett to step in and save the day.In recent years, Buffett has lowered Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) exposure to the sector.However, investors are hoping Buffett could potentially increase Berkshire’s banking stock exposure once again. These hopes are largely based on Berkshire’s large purchases of preferred shares in Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in past financial crises.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmong scores of hard-hit large and regional bank stocks, here are seven that Buffett may ultimately lend a helping hand.Ally Financial (ALLY)ally financial office building stocks to buySource: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to Warren Buffett and big banking stock investments, Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) is likely a name that comes to mind. Berkshire owns around 10% of this automotive-focused bank. There have also been rumors that Buffett’s firm would acquire this financial institution outright.As InvestorPlace analyst Louis Navellier has argued, there is plenty of evidence that suggests Berkshire isn’t interested in making this bank a wholly owned subsidiary. Still, if the auto loan crisis worsens, it’s easy to see Buffett stepping in and making another ALLY stock investment. Just not in the common shares.If a true crisis with Ally emerges, I can see Berkshire making a big preferred stock investment in Ally, on very favorable terms (high coupon rate on the preferred stock with warrants thrown in as part of the deal). That said, as a worsening crisis will undoubtedly send ALLY sinking, follow Navellier’s lead and stay away.Comerica (CMA)A sign for Comerica (CMA) bank in California. Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comWhile Ally is still far from crisis mode, one can argue that Comerica (NYSE:CMA) is much closer to reaching that point. This regional bank’s shares have dropped by more than 50% since the banking crisis first took shape in early March.Story continuesCMA stock has continued to drift lower as concerns over deposit declines and unrealized loan losses outweigh positives such a revenue and earnings beat for the preceding quarter. Comerica is one of several large and mid-sized regional banks that ratings firm Moody’s downgraded last month.These institutions are especially vulnerable, as the commercial real estate crisis could worsen their situations further. If Comerica turns into a situation akin to PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), the bank could end up going hat in hand to deep-pocketed investors.PNC Financial (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comOperating across 27 U.S. states, PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) is what’s known as a super regional bank. Too small to be a big bank, yet at the same time too large compared to other regional banking names.Still, that hasn’t stopped PNC stock from falling out of favor. Shares have tumbled by more than 28% since March. However, it is possible that the market has overreacted with its derating of PNC. As InvestorPlace Markets Analyst Thomas Yeung argued earlier this month, the bank’s national footprint may lower the chances it becomes the next First Republic (OTCMKTS:FRCB).Hence, shares could make a big recovery once current industry headwinds pass. PNC may not need a Buffett bailout, but Berkshire (which owned the stock until late 2020) could always decide to re-enter a position.Charles Schwab (SCHW)charles schwab sign outside of a building. SCHD stockSource: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.comCharles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) is best known for its stock brokerage operations, but it makes sense why investors have had serious banking crisis-related concerns about the firm. Schwab’s banking operations are sitting on heavy unrealized bond losses.Rising interest rates have also resulted in clients moving excess cash out of their brokerage accounts in order to take advantage of savings accounts elsewhere offering higher yields. With this trend likely to have a serious impact on future earnings, SCHW stock has fallen by more than 35% since early March.To shore up investor confidence, Charles Schwab could really use the Warren Buffett “seal of approval” right now. However, I wouldn’t count on Berkshire announcing it has purchased a large block of SCHW shares anytime soon. Trading for 13.5 times earnings, the stock is likely fairly priced at best, so not exactly the type of “wonderful business” that Buffett likes to buy.State Street (STT)A photo of the State Street logo on a skyscraperSource: EyeofPaul/Shutterstock.comState Street (NYSE:STT) is yet another major financial services firm caught up in the crisis. Like with Schwab, news of declining deposits has placed considerable pressure on shares in recent months.As a result, STT stock has plunged from around $90 per share to around $69 per share today. However, while Schwab may be fairly priced despite deposit headwinds, the situation may be different with State Street. Following the pullback, shares trade for just 9.5 times earnings.Furthermore, despite concerns about falling net interest margin, analyst forecasts still call for State Street to report solid earnings growth. By 2025, earnings per share (or EPS) could come in at $9.86. Not bad for a $69 stock. Buffett may not be fully bullish on bank stocks right now, but if the dust starts to settle, he may consider undervalued, oversold names like this one.Truist (TFC)Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comTruist (NYSE:TFC) is another super regional bank that has been hammered since March. In fact, with its drop from the mid-$40s to the high-$20 range, the selloff with TFC has been more dramatic than with other super regional bank stocks like PNC.After falling by around 40%, TFC stock today trades at a dirt-cheap 6 times earnings, and sports a forward yield of 7.62%. As a Seeking Alpha commentator has recently argued, this bank is far from stressed. At least, based on the bank’s loan-to-deposit (or LDR) ratio. This bank has a lower LDR ratio than its peers.Instead of being a value trap, Truist may represent deep value at current prices. Similar to State Street, if some of the uncertainty clears up about banking and Buffett decides to increase Berkshire’s bank stocks exposure, TFC may just well be a name he considers.U.S. Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWith Berkshire Hathaway selling nearly all of its stake in 2022, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) may appear at first to be one of the bank stocks least likely to receive some support from Buffett.However, while Buffett may not be looking to buy more USB stock on the open market anytime soon, this could be one of the top contenders to receive a preferred stock investment from Berkshire if its financial condition deteriorates further. As I wrote recently, there is a strong chance the situation with U.S. Bancorp worsens from here.Why? According to a short report issued by Holdco Asset Management, if this bank has to start counting certain unrealized loan losses when calculating its capital ratios, it may need to raise more capital. Given the past investment and relationship, Berkshire looks like a likely provider of potential future capital infusions. On terms favorable to Berkshire, of course.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Gross profit margins expanded to 26.3% compared to 25.7% a year ago.The company's chief operating officer John Mulligan told analysts on a conference call that last year's ""excess inventory"" problem was now in the ""rearview mirror.""TJX Companies — the owner of T.J.Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods — also posted better margins as inventory levels declined 8% and cost pressures eased.On a call with analysts, TJX CFO John Klinger said the off-price retailer is “strongly positioned” to take advantage of the current deal-hunting environment and feels “great” about current inventory levels.Walmart's US inventory fell 9.4% in the first quarter from a year ago, but profit margins still declined. In part, that was because shoppers spent more on lower-margin groceries and less on big-ticket, higher-margin items like home goods and electronics.The inventory plunges represent a dramatic reversal from less than a year ago.That's when levels were at record highs after stores over-ordered and were sitting on more than $730 billion of merchandise that more cautious consumers weren’t interested in buying.""We're way past the peak [on inventory],"" Bernstein Analyst Aneesha Sherman told Yahoo! Finance Live. ""Many leading brands and retailers have cleared it off their balance sheets.""Story continuesFurther improvements in supply chains — after the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the flow of goods —have also helped retailers.""Many of the pandemic-fueled supply chain issues have resolved, so retailers can again count on delivery accuracy,"" former Toys 'R' Us CEO Gerald Storch told Yahoo Finance Live.Storch added, ""This allows a more 'just-in-time' approach to function,"" which gives retailers the ability to keep their inventory lean and adapt to changing demands.More retailers slated to report earnings this week, such as American Eagle Outfitters, Lowe's, and Big Lots, could also deliver welcomed inventory declines to investors.So far, investors appear to have ignored the improvements in inventory levels — instead paying closer attention to what looks to be a slow start to the second quarter for retail.Target, Walmart, and Foot Locker (FL) all served up cautious comments on the state of the consumer as they battle with elevated inflation.The VanEck Retail ETF (RTH) has risen slightly in the past five trading sessions as retail earnings have trickled in. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.5% over that same stretch.""There'll be winners and losers. Not all boats rise. And just because you have value attached to your name doesn't mean you'll win, either,"" Storch said.But provided the economy doesn't fall off a cliff, lean inventories at retailers set the stage for more margin gains during the crucial upcoming back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.That may ultimately get the attention of skeptical investors.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

91,7084befa-d7fb-381b-bc2e-796d1f11dc36,TGT,2023-05-22,"Walmart, Target and Foot Locker are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-foot-locker-part-091500890.html,1684746900,STORY,"['FL', 'WMT', 'TGT', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 22, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Foot Locker FL.Dissecting Retail Earnings and Shifting Consumer Spending TrendsIt is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates, and uncertainty about the economy has forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores and digital offerings in response to the aforementioned headwinds. The expected continuation of this same trend is also at the root of management’s upgraded guidance for the year.Another trend at play is the shift in consumer preference for ‘wants’ instead of ‘needs.’ Given the macroeconomic clouds, it makes intuitive sense that consumers will rationally shift away from discretionary spending categories without curbing their demand for essentials. Walmart is better positioned than Target for such an environment, given its significantly bigger grocery business.However, we should keep in mind that consumers aren’t moving away from all discretionary categories as they continue to spend on leisure, hospitality, and travel services. Consumers spent heavily on discretionary ‘goods’ during Covid and seem to be in no hurry to replace them. But they seem to be making up for missing out on the ‘experiential’ discretionary services of the type mentioned above.Some of this is likely tied to income distributions as well, with lower-income consumers restricting their spending to their needs and pulling back on discretionary spending of all types.Story continuesAn excellent example of this is Friday’s Foot Locker bombshell, with the company not only missing estimates but significantly cutting guidance for the year. Foot Locker is heavily exposed to lower-income consumers, and that demographic’s outlook remains uncertain, particularly if the labor market starts losing ground going forward because of macroeconomic factors.The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times, and these are anything but normal times.They need just the right amount of inventory. Otherwise, they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise, as was the case earlier in the pandemic, or will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmartand Targetlast year.Then there is outright theft, referred to as ‘shrink’ by the retailers. Target estimates that ‘shrink’ will be a $500 million hit to its earnings this year. Most management teams shy away from quantifying the full extent of this problem. But published comments from retail industry professionals suggest that the problem has never been this big.Retailers also need to ensure they have the correct type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much patio furniture last Spring that consumers weren’t interested in buying. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just the right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target, and others face daily.Both Walmart and Target have done an excellent job on the inventory front, but part of the reason for the Foot Locker guidance cut is the inventory pileup. What is most intriguing concerning Foot Locker is that they failed to see any of this during their March 2023 update.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart has been better, Target less so.With respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 26 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s official industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 26 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already include the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q1 earnings for these 26 retailers that have reported are up +6.2% from the same period last year on +6.6% higher revenues, with 84.6% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +46.8% on +9.4% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.Q1 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 19th, we now have Q1 earnings from 473 S&amp;P 500 members, or 94.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -3.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with 78% beating EPS estimates and 74.8% beating revenue estimates.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 63%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either.With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears were warning us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have about 150 companies on deck to report results, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. This week’s docket includes Lowe’s, Nvidia, Best Buy, Ralph Lauren, Dicks Sporting Goods, and others.The Earnings Big Picture2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -3.8% on +4.4% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.We get down to earnings on positive revenues when margins are squeezed. That’s what we have been witnessing in the ongoing earnings season, which is in-line with the trend we have been seeing for some time now. In fact, 2023 Q1 is the 5th quarter in a row of declining margins.Actual results provide a lot better on this front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases, with the outperformance particularly notable for the Tech sector.One notable recent development on the earnings front, which we have been flagging in recent weeks, is the reversal on the revisions front, with full-year 2023 earnings starting to go up since the start of April. This comes after almost a year of steady declines in full-year 2023 earnings, which peaked in April 2022.Since the start of 2023 Q2, aggregate bottom-up S&amp;P 500 earnings are flat or unchanged as a whole and +0.4%, excluding the Energy sector, whose estimates have been coming down. In fact, estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are up since the start of Q2, with notable increases in the Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Retail, and Tech sectors. On the negative side, estimates are coming down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Aerospace, and Transportation sectors.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Decoding Recent Positive Earnings Estimate Revisions  Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

92,b7af0f18-f652-3ccb-9ff0-630cd45f19d6,RCL,2023-05-22,3 Analyst Upgrades That Smart Investors Won’t Ignore,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-analyst-upgrades-smart-investors-172903518.html,1684344543,STORY,"['ALB', 'GILD', 'RCL']","[Even the most experienced investors have only so many hours in the day to perform their due diligence. That’s where analyst ratings can be helpful. Analyst upgrades and downgrades frequently move stocks.  Analysts spend a great deal of time covering a particular stock or an entire sector. This gives them access to information and company insiders that retail investors don’t have. One of an analyst’s key responsibilities is to issue a rating and/or price target for the stocks that they cover. Many analysts issue revisions to ratings and/or price targets around a company’s earnings report. These give investors a better idea of how an analyst views a stock.  Analyst upgrades are generally seen as a bullish sign for a stock. That’s because analysts are generally looking 12 to 18 months ahead. So savvy investors will use an analyst upgrade as a signal to enter or add to a position for a particular stock.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCan analysts get it wrong? Of course they can. That’s why analyst upgrades shouldn’t be the only consideration for investors. But in many cases, they can point investors to opportunities like the ones in the stocks on this list. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) Serenade of the Seas cruiseSource: NAN728 / Shutterstock.comCruise line stocks dropped sharply at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. But if you had money that you could afford to keep on the sidelines, you could see the potential comeback. And Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) was a target for many investors.  That patience is paying off. RCL stock is up 56% in 2023 and over 220% since the onset of the pandemic. And it may be just getting started. In its most recent earnings report, Royal Caribbean posted $2.89 billion in revenue. That makes four straight quarters that the cruise line is seeing revenue that’s back to pre-pandemic levels. More importantly, the negative 23 cents earnings per share is significantly better on a year-over-year basis. It also suggests that a return to profitability may come sooner than later. Story continuesSince the earnings report, Argus upgraded the stock from a Hold to a Buy and gave RCL stock a price target of $88 which is 13% higher than the current stock price. In addition to the upgrade, four analysts have boosted their price target for RCL stock. One of those estimates was higher than the consensus price as of this writing for $83.14. Gilead Sciences (GILD) A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAnother stock benefiting from analyst upgrades is Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). The biotechnology company has been a solid performer in the last five years. GILD stock is up 16.62% in that time. And a recent upgrade suggests there may be more upside ahead.  Gilead recently announced an expansion of its research deal with Arcus Biosciences (NYSE:RCUS). Under the terms of the deal, Gilead has to make milestone payments to Arcus when the companies make new discoveries. That means earnings may take a short-term hit.  But whenever you consider investing in a biotech company, it’s about the pipeline. Gilead and Arcus already have been working on oncology treatments. And that should only increase as the companies will be looking for treatments for inflammatory diseases.  Since Gilead reported earnings in April, BMO Capital Markets upgraded the stock from Market Perform to Outperform with a price target of $100. That’s nearly a 25% improvement from the current stock price of around $77.  Albemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comThe last of our stocks benefiting from analyst upgrades is Albemarle (NYSE:ALB). The company is one of the top North American lithium miners. ALB soared in 2022 along with lithium prices reaching a 52-week high of $334.55 in November 2022.  Lithium is a core component of the lithium-ion batteries that are required for electric vehicles (EVs). However, the lithium rush that some investors were expecting is temporarily on hold. In its most recent earnings report, Albemarle lowered its guidance for 2023 based on falling lithium prices. However, the demand for the rest of the decade remains strong. Trading at just over 6x earnings, ALB stock is an intriguing buy for patient investors.  Since its May earnings report, Albemarle has received three analyst upgrades and one downgrade. The most recent upgrade came from Robert W. Baird on May 15 with a $288 price target. That would push the stock to a level not seen since November 2022. And Albemarle offers a dividend that has been increasing for 30 years.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Gross profit margins expanded to 26.3% compared to 25.7% a year ago.The company's chief operating officer John Mulligan told analysts on a conference call that last year's ""excess inventory"" problem was now in the ""rearview mirror.""TJX Companies — the owner of T.J.Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods — also posted better margins as inventory levels declined 8% and cost pressures eased.On a call with analysts, TJX CFO John Klinger said the off-price retailer is “strongly positioned” to take advantage of the current deal-hunting environment and feels “great” about current inventory levels.Walmart's US inventory fell 9.4% in the first quarter from a year ago, but profit margins still declined. In part, that was because shoppers spent more on lower-margin groceries and less on big-ticket, higher-margin items like home goods and electronics.The inventory plunges represent a dramatic reversal from less than a year ago.That's when levels were at record highs after stores over-ordered and were sitting on more than $730 billion of merchandise that more cautious consumers weren’t interested in buying.""We're way past the peak [on inventory],"" Bernstein Analyst Aneesha Sherman told Yahoo! Finance Live. ""Many leading brands and retailers have cleared it off their balance sheets.""Story continuesFurther improvements in supply chains — after the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the flow of goods —have also helped retailers.""Many of the pandemic-fueled supply chain issues have resolved, so retailers can again count on delivery accuracy,"" former Toys 'R' Us CEO Gerald Storch told Yahoo Finance Live.Storch added, ""This allows a more 'just-in-time' approach to function,"" which gives retailers the ability to keep their inventory lean and adapt to changing demands.More retailers slated to report earnings this week, such as American Eagle Outfitters, Lowe's, and Big Lots, could also deliver welcomed inventory declines to investors.So far, investors appear to have ignored the improvements in inventory levels — instead paying closer attention to what looks to be a slow start to the second quarter for retail.Target, Walmart, and Foot Locker (FL) all served up cautious comments on the state of the consumer as they battle with elevated inflation.The VanEck Retail ETF (RTH) has risen slightly in the past five trading sessions as retail earnings have trickled in. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.5% over that same stretch.""There'll be winners and losers. Not all boats rise. And just because you have value attached to your name doesn't mean you'll win, either,"" Storch said.But provided the economy doesn't fall off a cliff, lean inventories at retailers set the stage for more margin gains during the crucial upcoming back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.That may ultimately get the attention of skeptical investors.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

94,0fa9b73f-498a-3c80-a6d4-e119f74b5a74,ADI,2023-05-22,Possible Bearish Signals With Analog Devices Insiders Disposing Stock \,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-analog-devices-110023300.html,1684753223,STORY,['ADI'],"[Over the past year, many Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Analog DevicesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology, Vivek Jain, for US$2.3m worth of shares, at about US$166 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$191. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 43% of Vivek Jain's holding.In total, Analog Devices insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The average sell price was around US$175. It's not particularly great to see insiders were selling shares at below recent prices. But we wouldn't put too much weight on the insider selling. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!Story continuesinsider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Analog Devices Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Analog Devices. Specifically, Independent Presiding Director James Champy ditched US$277k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Analog Devices insiders own about US$338m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Analog Devices Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But since Analog Devices is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Analog Devices.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

96,d8bef71b-4c97-389a-aced-1e3fadc61ca0,APH,2023-05-22,Investing in Amphenol (NYSE:APH) five years ago would have delivered you a 83% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-amphenol-nyse-aph-five-112857048.html,1684754937,STORY,['APH'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) share price is up 74% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 46% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 10% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Amphenol While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Amphenol managed to grow its earnings per share at 23% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amphenol has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Amphenol, it has a TSR of 83% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Amphenol shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 10% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 13% a year, is even better. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Amphenol better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Amphenol   you should know about.Of course Amphenol may not be the best stock to buy.

97,85eb1b32-96f7-3473-9cb9-d2e15ddc0444,SNA,2023-05-22,Here's Why We Think Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) Is Well Worth Watching,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-snap-nyse-121649611.html,1684671409,STORY,['SNA'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Snap-on (NYSE:SNA). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Snap-on Snap-on's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, Snap-on has grown EPS by 15% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Snap-on's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for Snap-on remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 5.6% to US$4.9b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Snap-on's future EPS 100% free.Are Snap-on Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Snap-on has a market capitalisation of US$14b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$248m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Snap-on, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.The Snap-on CEO received US$9.5m in compensation for the year ending December 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is Snap-on Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Snap-on is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Snap-on, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. Still, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Snap-on (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable).There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

However, if you want to go straight to the top five stocks, you can look at the 5 Stocks Warren Buffett Sold.Berkshire Hathaway, headed by Warren Buffett, sold $13.3 billion worth of stock in the first quarter of 2023 while investing only a fraction of that amount in US equities. This is because the market appeared unappealing to the veteran investor. Instead, the company spent $4.4 billion buying back its stock and $2.9 billion on publicly traded businesses. According to Buffett and his long-time colleague Charlie Munger, Berkshire is struggling to put its $130.6 billion cash pile to work due to high valuations.Buffett said at the company's latest annual meeting that he expected earnings to decline in most of the company's businesses this year as the economy slows and interest rates rise.Berkshire's stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was valued at $151 billion at the end of the quarter, just under half the value of its entire stock portfolio. Berkshire's stock has risen 4.9% since the start of the year. At the annual shareholder meeting, Buffett reiterated his support for low-cost index funds and warned against making ""stupid mistakes"" that could lead to debt. He also stressed the importance of staying rational when making investment decisions. Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman Charlie Munger emphasized the value of intelligence and advocated for more free trade with China. Buffett and Munger agreed that increased competition would make value investing more difficult.Buffett has ramped up efforts to exit banking stocks and adjust his portfolio in the past few quarters primarily because of the Covid-19 pandemic that unbalanced the sector and led to the accelerated collapse of First Republic Bank (OTCMKTS:FRCB), Silicon Valley Bank (NASDAQ:SIVB), Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY), and Silvergate Capital Corporation (NYSE:SI).

Synchrony is a private-label credit card issuer that works with retailers and affinity groups. While we still believe the company is substantially undervalued, we ultimately decided to consolidate our exposure to the private credit industry in our investment in Capital One.

(NYSE:GOLD)Stock returns since Warren Buffett sold: -14% SPY total return in the same period (annualized return): 11% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) is a mining company that produces gold and copper. It is the world's second-largest gold miner and operates in 13 countries. Berkshire Hathaway acquired a stake in the company in Q2 2020, surprising many investors who saw Buffett as a critic of gold as an investment – it acquired 20.9 million shares, worth about $564 million at the time. This boosted the share price of Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) and other gold miners as gold prices reached record highs amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Buffett offloaded the shares in the same year, in Q4 2020, as gold prices retreated from their record highs. Since Buffett's exit, Barrick Gold's share price has fluctuated between $18.64 and $28.50 per share.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Old West Management provided the following statement regarding Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD):""Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) is the second largest gold miner in the world, with operations in the U.S., Canada, Africa, South America, and more. Barrick is also a major copper producer. Former Goldman Sachs executive John Thornton took control of the company in 2012 and quickly realized he wanted someone with a mining background to run the company. Mark Bristow, at that time CEO of Randgold, was considered one of the best gold mining executives in the world. Thornton wanted Bristow so badly Barrick bought Randgold in 2018. Bristow, who is South African, had extensive experience operating mines throughout Africa, and, in fact, would fly his own single-engine plane to visit mines. In addition, he has his Ph.D. in Geology and has flourished running Barrick for the past five years.Barrick is estimated to have $1.6 billion of net income this year on $11.5 billion of revenue. Net Income has been growing by 15% per year. The stock trades at $19.00 per share, 16 times forward earnings, and has a 3.15% dividend yield.

Its activities concentrate on exploration and production of oil and gas, as well as refining and marketing it to millions of customers across the globe. The company also recently entered the renewable energy sector. The Suncor Energy Inc (NYSE:SU) stock performance has been volatile since Q4 2020 (when Berkshire Hathaway exited), reflecting the fluctuations in oil prices and demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the OPEC+ supply cuts. The share price reached a four-year high of $41.31 on June 10, 2022, but then shed more than 40% of the gains in just three months.Here is what Artisan Partners said about Suncor Energy Inc (NYSE:SU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU), a Canada-based operator of oil sands mines, refineries and retail gas stations, was the third-largest contributor to return for the year, mainly due to higher oil prices. The share price increased by one third. Notably, the portfolio generated significant returns from energy stocks, including Suncor, Tenaris, Imperial Oil and tangentially Alimentation Couche-Tarde and Seven &amp; i Holdings, both of which are in the gas station business. Given the cyclicality and commodity nature of the oil business, we have sold shares of these investments, including the complete sale of both Tenaris and Imperial Oil.” 6. Verizon Communications Inc.

The company's stock is leading the pack among well-known chip-makers: AMD (AMD) shares are up 63% on the year, Intel (INTC) has advanced 14%, and Qualcomm (QCOM) shares have actually lost 3.6%.The stock has even outperformed mighty Apple's (AAPL) 35% appreciation.""Nvidia is trading on heroic valuations which time will tell if they are justified,"" quipped Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a client note Monday.To Reid's point, Nvidia's valuation clearly puts the stock in priced-for-perfection territory.The stock trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 63 times, according to Yahoo Finance data. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.8 times.In effect, investors are banking on Nvidia to grow its future earnings by more than three times the rate of the S&amp;P 500.That's a tall order.On a trailing 12-month basis, Nvidia's stock trades on an exorbitant 117 times enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiple. Zooming in on the trailing price-to-sales ratio, investors are greeted with a lofty 27 times multiple.Out of the 57 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 77% rate the stock a buy. There are zero sell ratings on Nvidia's stock on Wall Street.So why the major optimism on Nvidia? Look no further than what Nvidia is building on the supercomputing and AI fronts.Microchip and Nvidia logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in this multiple exposure illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on April 10, 2023. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)Monday brought news out of Germany, where Reuters reported the company unveiled a new supercomputer in partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) at a supercomputing conference. The computer — called Isambard 3 — is based on Nvidia's new high-powered Grace CPU chips.The Grace CPU chips take aim at similar ones offered by AMD and Intel.Story continuesMeantime, OpenAI's popular generative AI platform ChatGPT was developed using Nvidia GPUs.And at its GTC conference in March, Nvidia showed off a host of solutions for training and deploying complex models inherent to generative AI.“We are seeing an acceleration in demand,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance Live. “We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for our DGX AI supercomputers. We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for inference, because of generative AI.”Wall Street's read is that Nvidia is a ""one-stop solution provider"" for all things tied to the hot generative AI movement, potentially leading to bumper profits well into the future.""With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/Networking), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high-performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view,"" JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a research note.Added Sur: ""Bottom line: Nvidia continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors in accelerated computing silicon/systems, software, and ecosystems.""These Nvidia bulls will be put to the test this week on two fronts.The company's AI technology is rumored to be on display at Microsoft's (MSFT) three-day developer conference that kicks off mid-week. And earnings are out after the close of trading on Wednesday.There is some chatter on the Street that no matter what Nvidia does this week, a pause in the stock price may be warranted due to those aforementioned heroic valuations.Warns Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya: ""Post-earnings volatility [on Nvidia] it to be expected given sky-high expectations and the stock's 97% return year to date (vs. Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 18%).""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA How Much Debt Does NVIDIA Carry?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NVIDIA had US$11.0b in debt in January 2023; about the same as the year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$13.3b in cash, so it actually has US$2.34b net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$6.56b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$12.5b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$13.3b and US$3.83b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$1.96b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Having regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$773.2b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesIt is just as well that NVIDIA's load is not too heavy, because its EBIT was down 44% over the last year. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While NVIDIA has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 82% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Summing UpWe could understand if investors are concerned about NVIDIA's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$2.34b. The cherry on top was that in converted 82% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$3.8b. So we don't have any problem with NVIDIA's use of debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.In recent years, inflation has consistently exceeded the Federal Reserve's target of 2% amid increased prices in commodities such as oil, copper, soybeans, and corn, reported. According to Wells Fargo Advisors weekly market commentary, this rise in commodity prices directly impacts average Americans, as they regularly encounter higher costs at the gas pump and grocery stores. Consumer sentiment is often influenced by gasoline prices, especially when they are on the rise. In the past few decades, as inflation and interest rates decreased from their peak levels in the early 1980s, the Federal Reserve has primarily focused on ""core"" inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. The rationale behind this approach is that monetary policy has limited influence over food and energy prices. Grain prices are influenced by various factors, including weather conditions in different regions around the world, making them less responsive to interest rate adjustments or changes in the money supply. Similarly, the oil market has often been subject to the impact of natural events like hurricanes, which can disrupt production and affect prices. Hence, monetary policy decisions have limited influence on natural phenomena. However, the demand for oil and gasoline is directly tied to economic expansions and contractions, which are influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions and the market's perception of their impact on demand. For instance, the recent decline in oil prices can be attributed, in part, to market expectations of a global economic slowdown and a potential recession in many developed countries. China's slower-than-anticipated recovery has also contributed to the downward pressure on oil prices and other commodities. According to Bloomberg, markets are experiencing anxiety due to concerns that leaders in Washington may not be able to prevent a historic default before the June 1 deadline. This uncertainty is unsettling investors and impacting market sentiment. As a result, yields across the US Treasury curve increased on May 16. Specifically, the yield on 30-year notes reached approximately 3.9%, marking its highest level since the regional bank turmoil in early March. The rising yields indicate that investors demand higher returns as they perceive an increased risk in holding long-term US government debt.Story continuesThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) were among the notable stocks that analysts recently downgraded. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) was downgraded primarily due to concerns about the slow recovery in China and the travel retail segment in Asia, where inventories are increasing. At the same time, ratings for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) were cut due to the deterioration of the company's outlook for direct-to-consumer subscribers and linear TV.

(NASDAQ:AVAH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 7Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) is a Georgia-based home care platform company offering private duty nursing, adult home health and hospice, and home-based pediatric therapy in the United States.On May 12, Raymond James lowered its rating on Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) from Strong Buy to Market Perform without providing a specific price target. According to the analyst's research note, although Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) Q1 results surpassed expectations, the company's performance still falls short of the necessary levels to maintain its equity value. The firm highlights that Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) metrics continue to pose high risks, particularly with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 11.1 times. Additionally, there is limited visibility regarding the substantial improvement in EBITDA required to establish an adequate margin of error, as stated by the analyst.09. SJW Group (NYSE:SJW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) provides water utility services in the United States. It specializes in the production, purchase, storage, purification, distribution, wholesale, and retail sale of water and wastewater services.Wells Fargo revised its rating on SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) from Equal Weight to Underweight on May 12 while maintaining an unchanged price target of $76. According to the analyst's research note, SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) shares are trading at valuation multiples similar to larger water utility companies. However, the analyst believes a slight discount would be more appropriate given the stock's ongoing ""show me"" narrative, accompanied by regulatory uncertainties that have not yet been fully resolved. The analyst also mentions that SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) management is rebuilding investor confidence following strategic missteps. As a result, Wells Fargo predicts that SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) shares will offer one of the lowest potential total returns among the five water utilities it covers over the next 12-18 months.08. Stantec Inc. (NYSE:STN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13According to Raymond James analyst Frederic Bastien's research note, Stantec Inc. (NYSE:STN) rating has been downgraded from Strong Buy to Outperform. However, the price target remains at C$90. The analyst stated on May 12 that Stantec's shares have already exhibited strong performance, which aligns with the firm's belief that the market can no longer overlook the company's improving and consistently positive performance, noteworthy ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) attributes, and promising future. This downgrade suggests that while the analyst still considers Stantec Inc. (NYSE:STN) attractive, the previous ""Strong Buy"" recommendation has been adjusted to an ""Outperform"" rating.07. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), an alcoholic beverage company based in London, is the owner of several distilleries. The company is responsible for manufacturing a majority of the total production of Scotch whisky and boasts a portfolio of over 24 brands, including Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B, and Vat 69.On May 12, in a research note, Jefferies downgraded Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) from Buy to Hold and reduced the price target from $200 to $190. The analyst explains that the downgrade results from a less optimistic short-term outlook for Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) primary market, the United States. The firm anticipates a normalization of industry growth following the extraordinary period during the pandemic and potential risks associated with inventory realignment in a slower macroeconomic environment. Recent data suggest a deceleration in growth within the U.S. market, prompting Jefferies to revise its recommendation.Here is what ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy has to say about Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Diageo is a leading global distiller and brewer which addresses the large ($500 billion-plus) and fragmented market for spirits. With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”06. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is a news, sports, and entertainment company. Fox Corporation Class A (NASDAQ:FOXA) shares carry additional voting rights compared to the regular common shares of Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX). Essentially, FOXA shares give shareholders more influence over the company's decision-making processes.Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall downgraded Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) from Overweight to Equal Weight on May 12, with a lowered price target of $35 (previously $44). The analyst explains that the firm had a positive outlook on Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) when its EBITDA was growing, the potential of sports betting appeared promising, and its balance sheet seemed appealing in the context of rising interest rates. However, looking ahead, the analyst finds fewer reasons for excitement and believes there are diminished prospects for the company.Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy NowWarren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Robinson Worldwide fair value estimate is US$92.16C.H. Robinson Worldwide's US$100 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimateOur fair value estimate is similar to C.H. Robinson Worldwide's analyst price target of US$93.04Does the May share price for C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$747.3mUS$602.9mUS$656.8mUS$644.3mUS$691.9mUS$715.3mUS$736.7mUS$756.9mUS$776.1mUS$794.9mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.38%Est @ 3.00%Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.55%Est @ 2.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$690US$514US$517US$469US$465US$444US$422US$400US$379US$359(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.7bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$795m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$5.9bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$11b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$100, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at C.H. Robinson Worldwide as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.040. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for C.H. Robinson WorldwideStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Logistics market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For C.H.

(NASDAQ:AVAH) is a Georgia-based home care platform company offering private duty nursing, adult home health and hospice, and home-based pediatric therapy in the United States.On May 12, Raymond James lowered its rating on Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) from Strong Buy to Market Perform without providing a specific price target. According to the analyst's research note, although Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) Q1 results surpassed expectations, the company's performance still falls short of the necessary levels to maintain its equity value. The firm highlights that Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAH) metrics continue to pose high risks, particularly with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 11.1 times. Additionally, there is limited visibility regarding the substantial improvement in EBITDA required to establish an adequate margin of error, as stated by the analyst.09. SJW Group (NYSE:SJW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) provides water utility services in the United States. It specializes in the production, purchase, storage, purification, distribution, wholesale, and retail sale of water and wastewater services.Wells Fargo revised its rating on SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) from Equal Weight to Underweight on May 12 while maintaining an unchanged price target of $76. According to the analyst's research note, SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) shares are trading at valuation multiples similar to larger water utility companies. However, the analyst believes a slight discount would be more appropriate given the stock's ongoing ""show me"" narrative, accompanied by regulatory uncertainties that have not yet been fully resolved. The analyst also mentions that SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) management is rebuilding investor confidence following strategic missteps. As a result, Wells Fargo predicts that SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) shares will offer one of the lowest potential total returns among the five water utilities it covers over the next 12-18 months.08. Stantec Inc. (NYSE:STN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13According to Raymond James analyst Frederic Bastien's research note, Stantec Inc. (NYSE:STN) rating has been downgraded from Strong Buy to Outperform. However, the price target remains at C$90. The analyst stated on May 12 that Stantec's shares have already exhibited strong performance, which aligns with the firm's belief that the market can no longer overlook the company's improving and consistently positive performance, noteworthy ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) attributes, and promising future. This downgrade suggests that while the analyst still considers Stantec Inc. (NYSE:STN) attractive, the previous ""Strong Buy"" recommendation has been adjusted to an ""Outperform"" rating.07. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), an alcoholic beverage company based in London, is the owner of several distilleries. The company is responsible for manufacturing a majority of the total production of Scotch whisky and boasts a portfolio of over 24 brands, including Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B, and Vat 69.On May 12, in a research note, Jefferies downgraded Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) from Buy to Hold and reduced the price target from $200 to $190. The analyst explains that the downgrade results from a less optimistic short-term outlook for Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) primary market, the United States. The firm anticipates a normalization of industry growth following the extraordinary period during the pandemic and potential risks associated with inventory realignment in a slower macroeconomic environment. Recent data suggest a deceleration in growth within the U.S. market, prompting Jefferies to revise its recommendation.Here is what ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy has to say about Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Diageo is a leading global distiller and brewer which addresses the large ($500 billion-plus) and fragmented market for spirits. With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”06. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is a news, sports, and entertainment company. Fox Corporation Class A (NASDAQ:FOXA) shares carry additional voting rights compared to the regular common shares of Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX). Essentially, FOXA shares give shareholders more influence over the company's decision-making processes.Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall downgraded Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) from Overweight to Equal Weight on May 12, with a lowered price target of $35 (previously $44). The analyst explains that the firm had a positive outlook on Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) when its EBITDA was growing, the potential of sports betting appeared promising, and its balance sheet seemed appealing in the context of rising interest rates. However, looking ahead, the analyst finds fewer reasons for excitement and believes there are diminished prospects for the company.Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy NowWarren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 Picks13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

118,048c5397-9c6d-30fc-9e9a-fa5d2923dbcb,EXC,2023-05-22,How Did Exelon Corporation's (NASDAQ:EXC) 8.9% ROE Fare Against The Industry?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-exelon-corporations-nasdaq-exc-121428796.html,1684671268,STORY,['EXC'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Exelon How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exelon is:8.9% = US$2.2b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.09 in profit.Does Exelon Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Exelon has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (9.1%).roeThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Exelon by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Exelon's Debt And Its 8.9% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Exelon, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.67. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Exelon may not be the best stock to buy.

Hence, the merger would harm the development of drugs in these areas.Amgen expressed its disappointment with the decision, noting that the medicines offered by Amgen and Horizon generally treat different diseases and patient populations, and there are no overlaps of competitive concern.

The company's stock is leading the pack among well-known chip-makers: AMD (AMD) shares are up 63% on the year, Intel (INTC) has advanced 14%, and Qualcomm (QCOM) shares have actually lost 3.6%.The stock has even outperformed mighty Apple's (AAPL) 35% appreciation.""Nvidia is trading on heroic valuations which time will tell if they are justified,"" quipped Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a client note Monday.To Reid's point, Nvidia's valuation clearly puts the stock in priced-for-perfection territory.The stock trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 63 times, according to Yahoo Finance data. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.8 times.In effect, investors are banking on Nvidia to grow its future earnings by more than three times the rate of the S&amp;P 500.That's a tall order.On a trailing 12-month basis, Nvidia's stock trades on an exorbitant 117 times enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiple. Zooming in on the trailing price-to-sales ratio, investors are greeted with a lofty 27 times multiple.Out of the 57 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 77% rate the stock a buy.

The computer — called Isambard 3 — is based on Nvidia's new high-powered Grace CPU chips.The Grace CPU chips take aim at similar ones offered by AMD and Intel.Story continuesMeantime, OpenAI's popular generative AI platform ChatGPT was developed using Nvidia GPUs.And at its GTC conference in March, Nvidia showed off a host of solutions for training and deploying complex models inherent to generative AI.“We are seeing an acceleration in demand,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance Live. “We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for our DGX AI supercomputers. We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for inference, because of generative AI.”Wall Street's read is that Nvidia is a ""one-stop solution provider"" for all things tied to the hot generative AI movement, potentially leading to bumper profits well into the future.""With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/Networking), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high-performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view,"" JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a research note.Added Sur: ""Bottom line: Nvidia continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors in accelerated computing silicon/systems, software, and ecosystems.""These Nvidia bulls will be put to the test this week on two fronts.The company's AI technology is rumored to be on display at Microsoft's (MSFT) three-day developer conference that kicks off mid-week. And earnings are out after the close of trading on Wednesday.There is some chatter on the Street that no matter what Nvidia does this week, a pause in the stock price may be warranted due to those aforementioned heroic valuations.Warns Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya: ""Post-earnings volatility [on Nvidia] it to be expected given sky-high expectations and the stock's 97% return year to date (vs. Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 18%).""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

It came just a day after the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations agreed they would look to ""de-risk, not decouple"" from China, and as Washington pressures its allies to join it in restricting chip equipment exports to China.Micron, which makes DRAM and NAND flash memory chips, is the first U.S. chipmaker to be targeted by Beijing after Washington over the past year unveiled a series of export controls to block certain chips and chipmaking technologies being used to advance China's military capabilities.While the move could benefit Micron's key rivals - South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix - in the near term, analysts said the growing geopolitical tensions cast a shadow over the industry as firms need to navigate rising uncertainties that could impact investment and supply chain management.Such tit-for-tat policies will make investment decisions difficult for all chipmakers, said Kim Sun-woo, analyst at Meritz Securities in Seoul. ""Companies have to address both production and sales. It would be better if production and sales happened in the same place, but this will keep dividing the two sides,"" he said.Just days before the ban, Micron announced a plan to invest up to 500 billion yen ($3.7 billion) in Japan in extreme ultraviolet technology, becoming the first chipmaker to bring the advanced chipmaking technology to Japan. Tokyo is striving to reinvigorate its chip sector, while the United States is increasingly urging its allies to work together to counter China's chips and advanced technology development.Story continuesMicron, which generated around 11% of its revenue from chip sales in mainland China in the last fiscal year, said it looks forward to continuing to engage in discussions with Chinese authorities, without commenting on whether Beijing's decision might also affect the company's investment plans for Japan in any way.""It takes huge amounts of pre-emptive investment to be a chipmaker, and it takes five years, 10 years to break even on those investments, so putting predictability into jeopardy makes investments difficult,"" said Changhan Lee, vice chair of the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association.""In the long term, this won't help anybody.""STUCK IN THE MIDDLEAlthough chip factories' costs vary according to capacity, chip type and country, the industry is one of the most capital-intensive manufacturing sectors, requiring construction of clean rooms and purchase of sophisticated chip manufacturing tools. Samsung, for example, spent a total of about 60 trillion won ($45.4 billion) to build two of its chip plants in Pyeongtaek, South Korea.In China, Samsung and SK Hynix, the world's No.1 and No.2 memory chipmakers, have invested billions of dollars in their chip factories, which import some equipment such as etching machines from the United States. When Washington announced restrictions on chipmaking exports to China last October, it issued a one-year waiver for Samsung and SK Hynix so they can import tools without having to apply for a license, but whether that waiver will be extended is not clear.""It's better to set up the most efficient production base considering fixed costs and wages, but a big variable called regulation has been added. It's more complicated,"" Kim at Meritz said.Analysts recommended accepting the rounds of Sino-U.S. trade war as status quo, while roundabout ways of importing memory chips may emerge in response to any further geopolitical pressure.The White House asked South Korea to urge its chipmakers, the world's biggest memory-chip producers, not to fill any market gap in China if the sale of Micron products were restricted, according to a report by the Financial Times last month.""(Korean chipmakers) are stuck in the middle and being bothered by all sides,"" said Kim at Meritz.Both Samsung and SK Hynix had no comment.""The U.S.-China hegemony war is here to stay,"" said Lee Min-hee, an analyst at BNK Investment &amp; Securities.""Now it's chips, later it will be rare earths, raw materials... This is going to continue.""($1 = 1,320.9300 won)(Reporting by Joyce Lee in Seoul and Josh Ye in Hong Kong; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Susan Fenton)]"

Rowe Price Group's (NASDAQ:TROW) investors will be pleased with their 3.8% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-groups-nasdaq-104810527.html,1684752490,STORY,['TROW'],"[In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 12% over a half decade.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for T. Rowe Price Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Looking back five years, both T. Rowe Price Group's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 0.6% per year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 3% per year, over the period. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, T. Rowe Price Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 3.8%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 6.9% in the last year, T. Rowe Price Group shareholders lost 8.2% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.8% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

These stocks, aka the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (or DJIA), represent 30 of America’s largest, most venerable companies, across multiple sectors. There are a total of 30 Dow components, but instead of buying the whole bunch, you may want to focus on what could be some of the strongest individual opportunities within the index.While few stocks that make up the DJIA can be classified as overvalued, there are few names that sport more-than-reasonable valuations at current prices. These names, all arguably oversold as of late, make for great long-term stocks to buy on the dip.Although in the near-term they may continue to trade sideways, or even move slightly lower, between the strength of their underlying businesses, plus a track record of dividends and dividend growth, each of these Dow stocks to buy could produce steady long-term returns for your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmerican Express (AXP)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks to buySource: ShutterstockAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a blue chip stock that needs little introduction. The financial services firm, best known for its charge and credit card products, has long been regarded as a high-quality stock, representing ownership in a business with a deep competitive moat.In recent months, however, investors have turned bearish on AXP stock. This sell-off in financial stocks due to the banking crisis has played a role, but a negative reaction to the company’s latest earnings report has also been a big factor. However, current sentiment for AXP works in the favor of long-term investors.Once concerns about the potential fallout from the current economic slowdown pass, shares could start bouncing back to past highs. Alongside appreciation potential, this stock (trading for a more-than-fair 15.6 times earnings) pays a dividend of 1.62%, and AXP’s rate of payout has tripled over the past decade.Story continuesCaterpillar (CAT)Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockEarlier this month, I called Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) one of the best dividend stocks to buy. However, it’s not only “dividend aristocrat” status and a 2.32% dividend yield that make shares in this construction and mining equipment maker a buy.CAT’s post-earnings slide since April makes it one of the best Dow stocks to buy on the dip. Not only has this pullback resulted in CAT stock now sporting an even higher forward yield. Shares have also fallen to a valuation of around 15.3 times earnings.Sure, on the surface that may sound pricey, or at best, a fair-price for CAT. Even so, keep in mind that sell-side forecasts call for earnings per share to rise from $12.64 in 2022, to over $20 per share by 2025. This earnings may enable Caterpillar to sustain, and add to, its current valuation over the next few years.Walt Disney (DIS)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is another one of the Dow stocks hit hard this latest earnings season. For the preceding quarter, the media conglomerate reported year-over-year revenue growth of 13%, and a big rebound in non-GAAP earnings.However, investors were not pleased to hear about falling subscriber numbers for the company’s Disney+ streaming platform. This news has sent DIS stock around 10% lower since the earnings release on May 10.  Nevertheless, this post-earnings weakness may make it one of the stocks to buy on the dip.As a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, “short-term pain” could pave the way for “long-term gain.” Why? This unexpected drop in subscribers is far outweighed by higher subscription fees and reduced operating costs. Analysts forecast that Disney’s turnaround could push annual earnings to $6.58 per share by 2025. Not too shabby, given you buy DIS today for $91 per share.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the epitome of blue chip stock. Operating in a resilient sector (healthcare), the company has a long track record of profitability and dividend growth. JNJ has raised its rate of payout 60 years in a row, making it one of the top “dividend kings.”Despite these strengths, JNJ stock has delivered a more mixed performance recently. Earlier this year, concerns about the company’s talcum powder cancer lawsuits resulted in an extended slide for shares. In April, the stock bolted higher upon news of an $8.9 billion settlement of these claims.However, bullishness about the settlement, as well as about its planned spinoff of Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) has waned. Yet while frustrating for existing investors, recent short-term hiccups enable new investors to scoop up JNJ at an attractive entry point. The stock trades for just 15 times earnings, and sports a nearly 3% dividend yield.JP Morgan (JPM)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockPlenty of analysts and commentators have stated that JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) will emerge as a “winner” (for lack of a better word) as a result of this year’s banking crisis. Back in April, I dove into the hype and facts surrounding this argument.My conclusion? While conceding that this big bank faces some of the same risks that caused numerous regional banks to fail (unrealized loan losses), explaining its pullback due to the crisis, I argued that JPM stock was trading at a historically-low valuation.Flash forward to now. JPM still trades below pre-crisis price levels. Yet while the bank doesn’t appear set to further capitalize on the crisis, a big rebound may be in store, once this crisis, plus other headwinds (such as with commercial real estate loans) clear up. While waiting for a comeback to take shape, you can receive a steady return, via JPM’s 3% dividend.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Source: ShutterstockIf capital compounding is one of your investment objectives, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best Dow stocks to buy. Shares in the healthcare company are up 678% over the past decade. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t think shares can rise by another 678% between now and 2033.However, UNH stock could still deliver outsized returns. As I have discussed in past coverage of this stock, UNH’s fast-growing Optum care and prescription benefits unit could enable the company to continue delivering above-average earnings growth.This more-than-justifies the stock’s current forward valuation of 19.2 times earnings. Better yet, instead of merely rising in tandem with increased earnings, UnitedHealth Group shares could benefit from multiple expansion. To top things off, UNH’s fast-growing dividend (which has grown by an average 17.1% annually over the past five years) may provide an additional boost to long-term total returns.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the “Dogs of the Dow,”  but many investors may also consider it one of the biggest dividend/value traps within the index. Shares in the pharmacy giant sport a 6.12% dividend yield.This may seem enticing to income-focused investors, yet this high payout has been far outweighed by steady price declines for WBA stock in recent years. So then, why do I consider it one of the best Dow stocks to buy today?Despite a lackluster performance since the late 2010s, a much-awaited recovery for the stock may be in store. Possibly in the early stages of a turnaround, if the company can continue to improve its fiscal performance, shares could be poised to make a big comeback. You can buy WBA today for just 7 times forward earnings, suggesting big upside in the event sentiment for the stock improves.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

NRG continues to expand through organic and inorganic initiatives. The company’s diverse customer base and long-term customer retention strategy increase the predictability of earnings.NRG’s focus on emission cuts will boost its long-term growth. Its dividend policy and share repurchase program will further increase shareholders’ value.However, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has to face risks related to disruptions in its fuel delivery system.TailwindsRecently, NRG completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home. Integration efforts for the same are now fully underway. The company defined growth synergy target of $30 million for 2023. It expects growth synergies of $300 million through a target for cross-sell, Vivint organic growth and sales channel optimization. In total, recurring synergies of $400 million are expected to be achieved over the next three years.The company has been consistently increasing its dividend to attract investors. In January 2023, its board of directors approved a quarterly dividend hike of 8%, which is in sync with NRG’s long-term annual dividend growth target rate of 7-9% per share. In April 2023, the board declared a quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share, which resulted in an annualized dividend of $1.51 per share.NRG Energy has made a significant progress in its transformation to an integrated power company, through its focus on customers. The company sells electricity to a range of customers and none of them contributed more than 10% to its revenues as of Dec 31, 2022. NRG has been able to retain customers due to its high-quality services. It does not depend on a single customer for revenues, which adds stability to customer bills and increases earnings predictability.HeadwindsThe disruption in NRG Energy’s fuel supplies could adversely impact its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. This is because the company relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel the majority of its power generation facilities. These facilities are subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in power production in case of counterparty failure or a disturbance in the fuel delivery system.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same industry are NiSource Inc.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Zimmer Biomet Holdings (NYSE:ZBH) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Zimmer Biomet Holdings:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.075 = US$1.4b ÷ (US$21b - US$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Zimmer Biomet Holdings has an ROCE of 7.5%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.1%. See our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings roceIn the above chart we have measured Zimmer Biomet Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Zimmer Biomet Holdings Tell Us?We're a bit concerned with the trends, because the business is applying 20% less capital than it was five years ago and returns on that capital have stayed flat. To us that doesn't look like a multi-bagger because the company appears to be selling assets and it's returns aren't increasing. In addition to that, since the ROCE doesn't scream ""quality"" at 7.5%, it's hard to get excited about these developments.Story continuesOur Take On Zimmer Biomet Holdings' ROCEIn summary, Zimmer Biomet Holdings isn't reinvesting funds back into the business and returns aren't growing. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 30% to shareholders over the last five years. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing Zimmer Biomet Holdings that you might find interesting.While Zimmer Biomet Holdings isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Pentair’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Pentair What Is Pentair Worth?According to my valuation model, Pentair seems to be fairly priced at around 9.68% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Pentair today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $53.94, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Pentair’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Pentair?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Pentair's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 48%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? PNR’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PNR, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Customers will have the option to take delivery of their aircraft with SAF and can refuel using SAF wherever available, including at the company’s Wichita Service Center.The company is committed to conscious manufacturing and features sustainably sourced interior materials in the aircraft. Textron Aviation also utilizes a robust recycling program and industrial wastewater pretreatment plants. According to the company’s energy supplier, Textron Aviation used 100 percent renewable wind electricity to power all of its Kansas-based facilities in 2022.With more than 1,000 560XLs delivered throughout the past 25 years, fractional owners and charter operators consistently choose the Cessna Citation 560XL series for its unparalleled combination of performance, comfort, ease of operation, range of mission capabilities and favorable operating efficiencies. The company plans to amend the 560XL type certification of the aircraft, so that pilots can transition to the Ascend through a simple approved differences course — making training easier and more cost-effective for customers.""Our talented team members at Textron Aviation have proven their ability to bring new industry-leading products to the market time and time again,"" said O’Bannion. ""We look forward to exceeding our customers’ expectations again with the new Cessna Citation Ascend.""The company is already seeing strong aircraft demand and is taking orders for the Ascend.

These stocks, aka the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (or DJIA), represent 30 of America’s largest, most venerable companies, across multiple sectors. There are a total of 30 Dow components, but instead of buying the whole bunch, you may want to focus on what could be some of the strongest individual opportunities within the index.While few stocks that make up the DJIA can be classified as overvalued, there are few names that sport more-than-reasonable valuations at current prices. These names, all arguably oversold as of late, make for great long-term stocks to buy on the dip.Although in the near-term they may continue to trade sideways, or even move slightly lower, between the strength of their underlying businesses, plus a track record of dividends and dividend growth, each of these Dow stocks to buy could produce steady long-term returns for your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmerican Express (AXP)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks to buySource: ShutterstockAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a blue chip stock that needs little introduction. The financial services firm, best known for its charge and credit card products, has long been regarded as a high-quality stock, representing ownership in a business with a deep competitive moat.In recent months, however, investors have turned bearish on AXP stock. This sell-off in financial stocks due to the banking crisis has played a role, but a negative reaction to the company’s latest earnings report has also been a big factor. However, current sentiment for AXP works in the favor of long-term investors.Once concerns about the potential fallout from the current economic slowdown pass, shares could start bouncing back to past highs. Alongside appreciation potential, this stock (trading for a more-than-fair 15.6 times earnings) pays a dividend of 1.62%, and AXP’s rate of payout has tripled over the past decade.Story continuesCaterpillar (CAT)Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockEarlier this month, I called Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) one of the best dividend stocks to buy. However, it’s not only “dividend aristocrat” status and a 2.32% dividend yield that make shares in this construction and mining equipment maker a buy.CAT’s post-earnings slide since April makes it one of the best Dow stocks to buy on the dip. Not only has this pullback resulted in CAT stock now sporting an even higher forward yield. Shares have also fallen to a valuation of around 15.3 times earnings.Sure, on the surface that may sound pricey, or at best, a fair-price for CAT. Even so, keep in mind that sell-side forecasts call for earnings per share to rise from $12.64 in 2022, to over $20 per share by 2025. This earnings may enable Caterpillar to sustain, and add to, its current valuation over the next few years.Walt Disney (DIS)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is another one of the Dow stocks hit hard this latest earnings season. For the preceding quarter, the media conglomerate reported year-over-year revenue growth of 13%, and a big rebound in non-GAAP earnings.However, investors were not pleased to hear about falling subscriber numbers for the company’s Disney+ streaming platform. This news has sent DIS stock around 10% lower since the earnings release on May 10.  Nevertheless, this post-earnings weakness may make it one of the stocks to buy on the dip.As a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, “short-term pain” could pave the way for “long-term gain.” Why? This unexpected drop in subscribers is far outweighed by higher subscription fees and reduced operating costs. Analysts forecast that Disney’s turnaround could push annual earnings to $6.58 per share by 2025. Not too shabby, given you buy DIS today for $91 per share.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the epitome of blue chip stock. Operating in a resilient sector (healthcare), the company has a long track record of profitability and dividend growth. JNJ has raised its rate of payout 60 years in a row, making it one of the top “dividend kings.”Despite these strengths, JNJ stock has delivered a more mixed performance recently. Earlier this year, concerns about the company’s talcum powder cancer lawsuits resulted in an extended slide for shares. In April, the stock bolted higher upon news of an $8.9 billion settlement of these claims.However, bullishness about the settlement, as well as about its planned spinoff of Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) has waned. Yet while frustrating for existing investors, recent short-term hiccups enable new investors to scoop up JNJ at an attractive entry point. The stock trades for just 15 times earnings, and sports a nearly 3% dividend yield.JP Morgan (JPM)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockPlenty of analysts and commentators have stated that JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) will emerge as a “winner” (for lack of a better word) as a result of this year’s banking crisis. Back in April, I dove into the hype and facts surrounding this argument.My conclusion? While conceding that this big bank faces some of the same risks that caused numerous regional banks to fail (unrealized loan losses), explaining its pullback due to the crisis, I argued that JPM stock was trading at a historically-low valuation.Flash forward to now. JPM still trades below pre-crisis price levels. Yet while the bank doesn’t appear set to further capitalize on the crisis, a big rebound may be in store, once this crisis, plus other headwinds (such as with commercial real estate loans) clear up. While waiting for a comeback to take shape, you can receive a steady return, via JPM’s 3% dividend.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Source: ShutterstockIf capital compounding is one of your investment objectives, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best Dow stocks to buy. Shares in the healthcare company are up 678% over the past decade. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t think shares can rise by another 678% between now and 2033.However, UNH stock could still deliver outsized returns. As I have discussed in past coverage of this stock, UNH’s fast-growing Optum care and prescription benefits unit could enable the company to continue delivering above-average earnings growth.This more-than-justifies the stock’s current forward valuation of 19.2 times earnings. Better yet, instead of merely rising in tandem with increased earnings, UnitedHealth Group shares could benefit from multiple expansion. To top things off, UNH’s fast-growing dividend (which has grown by an average 17.1% annually over the past five years) may provide an additional boost to long-term total returns.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the “Dogs of the Dow,”  but many investors may also consider it one of the biggest dividend/value traps within the index. Shares in the pharmacy giant sport a 6.12% dividend yield.This may seem enticing to income-focused investors, yet this high payout has been far outweighed by steady price declines for WBA stock in recent years. So then, why do I consider it one of the best Dow stocks to buy today?Despite a lackluster performance since the late 2010s, a much-awaited recovery for the stock may be in store. Possibly in the early stages of a turnaround, if the company can continue to improve its fiscal performance, shares could be poised to make a big comeback. You can buy WBA today for just 7 times forward earnings, suggesting big upside in the event sentiment for the stock improves.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Hence, the merger would harm the development of drugs in these areas.Amgen expressed its disappointment with the decision, noting that the medicines offered by Amgen and Horizon generally treat different diseases and patient populations, and there are no overlaps of competitive concern. According to Amgen, the FTC's remark that it may ""bundle"" these medicines in the future is entirely speculative and does not reflect the real-world competitive dynamics behind providing rare-disease medicines to patients.Horizon shares closed the week with more than a 9% loss, while Amgen fell around 3%.Magellan Midstream surges on Oneok acquisition announcement Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) shares jumped nearly 13% on Monday after ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) announced it will acquire the company in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $18.8B, as InvestingPro reported in real time.The total enterprise value of the combined company is expected to be $60B.

Hosted out of Mumbai and simulcast to 8 countries, the signature event saw deliberations on the latest clinical guidance on screening and management of the growing public health concern of Peripheral Neuropathy.P&amp;G Neuropathy Awareness Week 2023 RoundtablePeripheral Neuropathy (PN) is a chronic clinical condition, wherein the peripheral nervous system is damaged. Symptoms of Peripheral Neuropathy include numbness, tingling, prickling, and burning sensations in the hands and feet. Sufferers of PN report impacts on their quality of life including reduced physical abilities and poor sleep. Besides Diabetes Mellitus, obesity, alcohol misuse, and B vitamins deficiencies are other high-risk factors leading to peripheral nerve damage.Aalok Agrawal, Senior Vice-President, P&amp;G Health, Asia, India, Middle East &amp; Africa said, ""1 in 10 people and 1 in 2 diabetics are suffering from Peripheral Neuropathy. Yet many are unaware that early diagnoses can enable successful treatment outcomes, and damaged nerves can be regenerated if nerve damage has not progressed too far.[4]  A leader in Nerve Health, P&amp;G Health has been committed to enabling improved treatment outcomes, and enhanced quality of life for consumers since 1962. Our 'Demystifying Neuropathy Forum' saw a multidisciplinary panel of experts from across the globe and the region come together to share their clinical recommendations on assessment and etiology of Peripheral Neuropathy, and holistic treatment approach including role of B vitamins in supporting healthy nerve functions.""Story continuesSpeaking at the forum, Prof.  Rainer Freynhagen, Head of Department, Anaesthesiology, Critical Care Medicine &amp; Pain Medicine at Benedictus Hospitals Tutzing &amp; Feldafing Germany stated, ""Peripheral Neuropathy and pain with neuropathic components are highly prevalent in the general population. Doctors around the globe see millions of patients suffering daily of these conditions which are relatively easy to diagnose but challenging to treat, particularly in advanced stages. Around 10% of the general population worldwide is affected by neuropathic pain and 50% of these patients are not sufficiently managed[1]. Although identifying a patient with PN is not rocket science, currently published studies across different countries confirm that up to 80% of patients remaining undiagnosed and untreated. Many people may report their painful sensations only after they become unbearable but for me much more important is the fact, that only less than 1/3rd of physicians are confident to recognize symptoms and signs of PN accordingly. To me it's appalling that for many physicians' neuropathic pain has often the lowest importance in comparison to other symptoms, even though it's one of the most burdenful problems with a tremendous impact on our patients quality of life.""Prof. Dr Satish V Khadilkar, Renowned Neurologist, Professor and Head of Department of Neurology at Bombay Hospital Institute of Medical Sciences in Mumbai, India stated, ""Diagnosing Peripheral Neuropathy is an unmet need. If PN is not diagnosed and treated in early stages, it usually progresses into neuropathic pain which can lead to several comorbidities which significantly impact the patient's quality of life, social life and working life[5]. These include depression, sleep disturbances, anxiety which also require treatment adding to the economic burden of the patient. Painful diabetic PN is significantly associated with disruptions in employment status and work productivity. Of working patients, 59% reported being less productive at work[6].""According to Dr Ankia Coetzee, Endocrinologist, University of Stellenbosch Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Cape Town, South Africa, ""Each contact with a patient is an opportunity and primary care physicians can play a key role in diagnosing neuropathy[7]. As some patients might have difficulties in describing their symptoms properly, proactively probing for characteristics of PN such as numbness, pins and needles and tingling sensation, lancinating, stabbing or electric shock like pain can be a good starting point. Easy to perform sensory tests such as vibration perception testing, pin prick test, monofilament test etc. take no longer than a few minutes and guide the diagnosis, while laboratory tests can help refine the diagnoses.""Dr Inna Eiberger, Global Medical Director, P&amp;G Health Nerve Care Franchise shared, ""Neurotropic B vitamins are essential for nerve health and support nerve regeneration. Vitamin B1 provides energy to the nerves, vitamin B6 helps with signal transmission in nerves, while vitamin B12 supports nerve regeneration. An in-vitro study initiated by P&amp;G Health showed that when Vitamin B1, B6, and B12 were added to nerve cultures with healthy nerve cells, there was an increase in total neurite length of 124% and an increase in the total cell body area of 55%. Nerve network of cells nourished with B1, B6, and B12, also doubled. Further in-vitro experiments have proven that Vitamins B1, B6, and B12 support nerve cell recovery after nerve cell damage.""P&amp;G Health also announced its collaboration with EcoMatcher, a social enterprise to plant a 'Global Forest of Care' with 2000 trees across India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia to mark the tireless efforts of the collective ecosystem of healthcare professionals (HCP), medical associations and health authorities towards research, awareness, and holistic management of peripheral neuropathy.About P&amp;G Health: P&amp;G Health, the health care division of P&amp;G company, combines breakthrough Science with deep patient and consumer understanding to deliver trusted, quality, recommended superior products that empower people to live healthier and more vibrant lives.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value stocks and their past performance, and go directly to read 5 Cheap Dividend Stocks With High Yields. The Importance of Investing in Undervalued/Cheap StocksInvesting in value stocks is one of the most popular methods to make money through the stock market. Value strategy involves discovering cheap stocks trading below their intrinsic value and investing in them, expecting them to eventually rise to their accurate value. As the market recognizes the true value of these stocks over time, value investors aim to generate long-term capital appreciation through them. These stocks usually have low price-to-earnings ratios.Over the years, there have been periods where either value or growth stocks have outperformed the other. Their performance has widely depended on various market conditions and investor sentiment. Historical analysis shows that value stocks performed better than growth equities during periods of high-interest rates and inflation. Franklin Templeton published a report on value stocks and highlighted that due to high-interest rates across the world last year, value equities surpassed growth stocks in global markets. The report further mentioned that trailing earnings per share of value companies have grown strongly over the last decade. So far in 2023, growth stocks have reasserted their dominance over value stocks.When analyzing the performance of both value and growth stocks, research has shown that value investing is a reliable strategy for long-term investors. One such study was conducted by Eugene Fama and Ken French and published by Dimensional Fund Advisors. The study cited that value stocks have surpassed their growth counterparts by 4.1% annually in the US from 1927 to 2021. This shows that value investing can be suitable for long-term investors, and is, therefore, one of the most preferred investment options for them.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Small-Cap Value Stocks to Invest InIn addition to their long-term results, many value stocks come from established companies with stable earnings and a history of paying dividends. Long-term investors seeking regular income can benefit from the dividend payments provided by value stocks, which can contribute to total returns over time. Dividend companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are popular among investors as they have raised their dividends for decades. Moreover, these companies also have strong balance sheets, which signal the growth of their future dividends.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.7. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)P/E Ratio as of May 19: 8.15 Dividend Yield as of May 19: 6.30%U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is an American bank holding company that offers a wide range of other financial services to its consumers. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share for a dividend yield of 6.30%, as of May 19. It has raised its payouts consistently for the past 12 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list.U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) generated over $7 billion in revenues in Q1 2023, up 28.2% from the same period last year. The company's net interest income for the quarter came in at over $4.6 billion, growing from $$4.3 billion from the prior-year period.In April, Argus maintained a Buy rating on U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) with a $58 price target, appreciating the company's first-quarter earnings. The firm also highlighted that the company's performance remained stable following the Silicon Valley Bank fallout.Madison Investments mentioned U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shares are ensnared in the bank-run panic that began late in the quarter. Two large banks failed in early March as depositors rushed to withdraw money on concerns that the banks would suffer from liquidity problems. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course, but in the case of the two banks, it was prompted by the revelations of utter mismanagement of their securities portfolio. Bank models are, essentially, to borrow short and lend long. This sounds dangerous of course, and it would be if not for the deposit guarantee provided by the FDIC. The history of the U.S. banking system can be divided into two eras – pre-FDIC, when bank runs were fairly common, and post-FDIC, when bank runs have been close to non-existent. However, FDIC protection has its limits, and it remains incumbent on management to properly manage its assets and liabilities. The two banks in question didn’t do that. By taking down the share prices of all banks, we think investors are shooting first and asking questions later; they are not distinguishing between the strong and the weak.U.S. Bancorp, as one of the largest and best-managed banks in the country, appears to be a net beneficiary so far of the panic among some depositors, with a pick-up in net deposit inflows in recent weeks. We don’t dismiss the probability of industry contagion – in a true nationwide panic, the big banks will suffer along with the small banks, and the well-managed ones will suffer along with the badly-managed ones. But we think the odds of that are quite small, and recent steps by federal regulators confirm that they will do everything in their power to prevent such a scenario, given the calamitous impact that it would have on our economy. We tightly manage this risk by limiting our exposure to the banking sector.”6. Northrim BanCorp, Inc.

They often move in sync, yet sometimes they surprise us with their own version of their favorite dance. But what if that rhythm changes and mortgage rates reverse their course – what could that mean for your portfolio?In the last few years, we’ve seen interest rates climb sharply upwards. This has made homeownership a much more expensive (and often impossible) prospect for many people living in America. However, these mortgage rates cannot continue climbing upward linearly. There are also some signs that mortgage rates are on their way back down to Earth again.So let’s stop and think: how will housing stocks react if mortgage rates drop? For one, it may create a favorable environment for picking up shares in undervalued housing companies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn this article, we’ll cover three housing-related stocks to buy if mortgage rates reverse course. A reversal in mortgage rates would be their main catalyst. Other compelling reasons make them good buys too. So let’s dive in and discover these opportunities.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comD.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) is the largest home construction company in the US. The company has also demonstrated consistent revenue growth and profitability. Their recent financial reports show it’s in a robust position. This is important to capitalize on declining mortgage rates.For example, in the company’s second quarter, it beat Zacks’s analyst estimates for its earnings per share (EPS) growth. Additionally, the company is showing signs of strong sales growth, posting revenues of $7.97 billion for the quarter. Another factor that plays into its bullish thesis is that the stock price is in a clear uptrend. Horton has been gaining ground since October last year. A rebound may give its rally some extra conviction for the bulls to continue the charge.Story continuesThere’s also evidence it’s preparing for a rebound in the housing market. In 2022, it increased its inventory to 54,800 homes, up 30% from 2021. Home prices are a critical factor for this stock, as it could considerably alter its fundamentals.In summary, Horton is in a strong position, both on fundamental and technical levels to benefit from a decrease in mortgage rates.Zillow Group (ZG)The zillow app on a screenSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.comZillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) is a key player in the online real estate market. The company recently suffered from a slump in real estate demand in the U.S. However, it has since shown signs of recovery. Zillow exceeded its guidance for revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in last year’s fourth quarter.Lower mortgage rates could increase the use of Zillow’s online marketplace. This in turn could lead to increased ad revenue and premium subscriptions. These services are part of key operating segments for Zillow’s business model.Looking ahead, the company is estimated to grow its EPS by 47.30% in 2024. A projected EPS increase could be partly due to mortgage rates falling.In Zillow’s case, the market seems to believe it will see improvements in its fundamentals, thus making it a stock to watch if rates fall lower.Annaly Capital Management (NLY)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockAnnaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests primarily in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) part of its strategy is to earn interest income on those securities.The REIT is poised to benefit from falling mortgage rates because as they decrease, more people can afford to take out mortgages. This, in turn, leads to more securities on the market, which leads to additional investment opportunities for companies like Annaly to explore.Although the company has seen its EPS shrink 38.60% this year, it’s poised for a turnaround if the wider market recovers. A big draw card is that its dividend yield stands at 13.81%, making it a high-risk investment that has a big upside.The brand is therefore a way to double down on one’s investment thesis of falling mortgage rates, making it a stock to watch.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

155,8b3dd13e-3a3f-3a38-876c-101894dba320,AAL,2023-05-22,The Undoing of American and JetBlue’s Northeast Alliance – in 11 Quotes,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/undoing-american-jetblue-northeast-alliance-063000840.html,1684737000,STORY,"['JBLU', 'DAL', 'AAL']","[American Airlines CEO Robert Isom (left) speaking on stage at Skift Aviation Forum in Dallas, Texas, November 2022. SkiftHis tone was measured, but Judge Leo T. Sorokin made it clear he wasn’t buying the argument from American and JetBlue that their “Northeast Alliance” promoted competition and was good for flyers.Instead, in a 94-page ruling Friday afternoon, Sorokin laid out the history of the so-called NEA in which the two airlines share revenue and coordinate schedules and other practices in servicing New York and Boston. Sorokin said it harms consumers by effectively removing one competitor from the market.In short, Sorokin wrote: “Through the NEA, American and JetBlue cease to compete and, instead, operate as a single carrier in the northeast. That is the core of the relationship, and it is a naked assault on competition.”The U.S. Department of Justice sued to block the American Airlines-JetBlue Northeast Alliance in September 2021. On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Sorokin said the partnership “substantially diminishes competition in the domestic market for air travel,” and ruled that the two airlines must unravel the partnership. An appeal is possible.Both American and JetBlue pushed back on the decision. American said, according to Reuters, “The court’s legal analysis is plainly incorrect and unprecedented for a joint venture.” It added that the alliance “has been a huge win for customers and anything but anticompetitive.” JetBlue said the “Northeast Alliance has been a huge win for customers” by extending the airline’s low fares “to more routes than would have been possible otherwise.”At a Skift event last November – before the the start of the trial – JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty defended the alliance to Edward Russell, Skift’s Transport editor and reporter: “If you look at the Northeast Alliance, Delta has doubled down in Boston. United has added a lot of capacity into Newark. And that’s all in response to what JetBlue and American are doing in the northeast. If that’s not a competitive response from legacy carriers that will drive competition and drive fares in a positive way, I don’t know what is.”Story continuesHere’s more background directly quoted from the court’s ruling:American and JetBlue are two of the four largest carriers operating in New York, and two of the largest three in Boston. Delta Air Lines is the only other carrier with a large presence in Boston.It is beyond dispute that, through June 2020, JetBlue vigorously and directly competed with American across all markets both carriers served.By 2020, JetBlue knew that Delta was mounting a challenge to its dominance in Boston.Around the same time, American was fretting about its operations in New York.In late 2019, the two carriers began discussing a possible lease, through which JetBlue would acquire temporary control over some of American’s slots at JFK… Talks between the carriers expanded to contemplate a broader domestic partnership focused on the northeast…The NEA was established and publicly announced on July 15, 2020….a relationship between American and JetBlue that includes codesharing, schedule coordination, revenue sharing, reciprocal loyalty benefits, and joint corporate customer benefits, all of which extend to most of the carriers’ flights to and from Logan, JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark (“the NEA airports”).[T]he record confirms what common sense suggests: in forming the NEA, American and JetBlue decided to stop competing and start cooperating with one another in the northeast.Airlines engaged in competition with one another would tactically respond to each other’s fares. They would consider launching new service to directly compete with a rival’s service on [origins and destinations]. They would not cede certain routes to a competitor. Within the NEA, American and JetBlue no longer adhere to these competitive practices with respect to one another. In that region, competition between them has effectively ceased.Though various executives claimed American and JetBlue continue to compete in some fashion within the northeast, there is no credible support for those claims. There is no evidence the defendants have engaged in meaningful competition with respect to fares, schedules, service, advertising, or anything else within the NEA region …It is abundantly clear to the Court that the defendants’ primary motivation in establishing the NEA was to strengthen their own competitive positions against Delta (and, to a lesser extent, United) in Boston and New York. Their own witnesses, business records, and submissions to the Court have repeatedly described this purpose.Essentially, American and JetBlue defend their partnership by broadly urging that “bigger is better,” and by claiming that they will be able to match or overtake (or, as they say, “compete with”) Delta only if they are permitted to stop competing with one another. That is not the kind of “competition” valued and protected by the Sherman Act.Watch: JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty at Skift Global Forum 2022Last fall, JetBlue’s President sat down with Airline Weekly Editor Ned Russell, when asked about the Northeast Alliance and the DOJ action, she told him “We’re confident that we will prevail.” Watch the video in full, below.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

SCCO, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX, Coeur Mining CDE, Energy Fuels UUUU and Amerigo Resources ARREF.Industry: Mining - Non-Ferrous MetalsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2097443/5-non-ferrous-metal-mining-stocks-to-watch-in-a-promising-industryDemand for non-ferrous metals is expected to be strong, mainly driven by the ongoing vehicle electrification and the increasing adoption of renewable energy, which will continue to support the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry. Also, the impending demand-supply imbalance is expected to help boost metal prices.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Southern Copper Corp., Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Coeur Mining, Energy Fuels and Amerigo Resources. These companies are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs, while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries, including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy.Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process. Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit, followed by the assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, precede actual mining. The miners search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally, as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Demand-Supply Imbalance to Support Prices: Gold and silver prices have gained lately, aided by the ongoing uncertainty around global economic growth, which has driven the safe-haven demand for metals. Copper prices had started this year on a strong note, fueled by investor expectations of a surge in demand after the reopening of the China economy.Story continuesHowever, weaker-than-expected data from China has weighed on copper prices lately. Industrial production in China was up 5.6% in April, much lower than the market expectations of 10.9%. Property investment plunged 16.2% and home construction continued to decline. Despite this recent pullback in prices, the International Copper Study Group recently lowered its projection of growth of world copper mine production from 5% to 3% for 2023. This is mainly due to operational and geotechnical issues, equipment failure, adverse weather, landslides, revised company guidance in a few countries, and community actions in Peru. Per the body, copper is likely headed for a deficit of 114,000 tons in 2023. This will help boost copper prices.Overall, industry players are dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and a lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. While demand has been strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, will favor the industry in the long haul.Cost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs.Industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies. Strong Demand to Support the Industry: Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future, given their wide use in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials. The demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy is expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will also require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects for the near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #48, which places it in the top 19% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 25% in the past year compared with the Zacks Basic Materials sector’s decline of 5.6%. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 8% in the said time frame.Industry''s Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining- Non Ferrous stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 8.14X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.75X. The Basic Materials sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is at 7.14X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 8.88X and as low as 4.80X, with the median at 7.02X.5 Mining - Non Ferrous Stocks to Keep an Eye OnAmerigo Resources: The company delivered another strong operational performance in the first quarter of 2023, with the production of 16.5 million pounds of copper at a cash cost of $1.91 per pound. Copper production in the quarter was 4.5% above the company’s guidance. Quarterly molybdenum production was 0.3 million pounds, 5.2% above the guidance. Strong credits from higher molybdenum prices cut down cash costs by 11%, or 23 cents per pound, compared to ARREF’s annual cash cost guidance of $2.14 per pound.The company expects copper production to be 62.3 million pounds in 2023. It outperformed its copper production for three consecutive years. Molybdenum production is expected to be 1 million pounds in 2023. Backed by its healthy cash balances, minimal debt and robust financial performance, the company continues its capital return strategy initiated in September 2021. ARREF declared its seventh consecutive quarterly dividend and continues its share buyback program.Vancouver, Canada-based Amerigo Resources is an innovative copper producer with a long-term relationship with Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer. It receives and processes the waste stream from Codelco to recover copper and molybdenum. Amerigo produces copper concentrate, and molybdenum concentrate as a by-product at the MVC operation in Chile by processing fresh and historic tailings from Codelco’s El Teniente mine, the world's largest underground copper mine. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 300%. The estimate has moved up 50% over the past 60 days. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Energy Fuels: In the first quarter of 2023, UUUU completed the sale of 300,000 pounds of uranium to the U.S. Uranium Reserve, realizing total gross proceeds of $18.47 million, or $61.57 per pound. This sale resulted in a gross margin of 58%. The company expects to sell an additional 200,000-260,000 pounds of uranium this year, per its supply agreements with U.S. nuclear utilities, at an expected sales price of $54-$58 per pound, leading to gross margins of 46-50%. It has made significant progress in preparing four conventional uranium and uranium/vanadium mines to resume ore production.The recent sale of the lower-priority Alta Mesa ISR Project will provide UUUU with significant additional cash and working capital, enabling it to ramp up its US industry-leading uranium and rare earth element (“REE”) production. The company continued to focus on growing its REE business. To this end, it has begun modifications and enhancements at the White Mesa Mill that will produce up to 1,000 MT per year of neodymium-praseodymium (""NdPr"") oxide by late 2023 or early 2024. UUUU plans to take up this figure to 3,000 MT by 2026.This Lakewood, CO-based company, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, exploration, processing, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium, vanadium and REE. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 253%. The estimate has gone up 263% over the past 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Southern Copper: The company has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates world-class assets in investment-grade countries, such as Mexico and Peru. Its constant focus on increasing low-cost production is commendable. SCCO expects copper production in 2023 to reach 940,000 tons, suggesting 5% growth from the 2022 reported levels. This will be aided by the Peruvian production coming back on track, and new production at Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista.The company’s capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments at the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico, and at the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. Southern Copper will gain from its efforts to grow in Peru, given that the country is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Phoenix, AZ-based company’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 15.7% over the past 60 days. The estimate indicates year-over-year growth of 14.7%. SCCO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7%, on average. The company, which engages in mining, exploring, smelting, and refining copper and other minerals, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Freeport-McMoRan: FCX’s exploration activities near existing mines, which are focused on expanding reserves, will drive growth. It is expected to benefit from the ongoing large-scale concentrator expansion project at Cerro Verde that will likely result in incremental annual productions of 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum. Cerro Verde's expanded operations will also offer cost efficiencies, and large-scale and long-lived reserves. It is assessing a large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material.The expansion at Morenci increased milling rates. The Lone Star project in eastern Arizona has been completed and is on track to produce more than 200 million pounds of copper annually. The company is looking to advance studies for potential expansions and long-term development options for its large-scale sulfide resources at Lone Star. It is also ramping up underground production at Grasberg in Indonesia, resulting in a spike in milling rates. The focus on cost management and reduction of debt levels is commendable.Based in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan is engaged in mineral exploration and development; mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver; and smelting and refining copper concentrates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FCX’s earnings for 2023 has moved up 2% over the past 30 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Coeur Mining:  The company reported total production of 69,039 ounces of gold and 2.5 million ounces of silver in the first quarter of 2023. The numbers were higher than expected, aided by solid performances at Palmarejo, Rochester and Wharf. Production levels are expected to increase in the second half of the year due to mine plan sequencing, as well as the anticipated ramp-up and commissioning of the Rochester expansion.As of Mar 31, 2023, the Rochester project was 82% completed. Approximately $634 million of the estimated project capital has been committed, of which $560 million has been incurred. CDE’s solid balance sheet positions it well to support the remaining Rochester expansion capital requirements.This Chicago, IL-based company explores, develops, and produces gold, silver, zinc and lead properties with five operations in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 53%. The estimate has moved up 50% over the past 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented positive Phase 3 results evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation. The Dupixent Phase 3 results were presented in the 2023 American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference session “New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Discussion on the Edge: Reports of Recently Published Pulmonary Research” and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). These results will also be presented in the “Breaking News: Clinical Trial Results in Pulmonary Medicine” session on May 22.“I've seen patients with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease struggle for far too long with the debilitating symptoms of this progressive disease – with limited, incremental improvement on current treatment options,” said Surya Bhatt, M.D., MSPH, Associate Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, and a co-principal investigator of the trial. “This trial showed that dupilumab has the potential to impact the vicious cycle of exacerbations and lung function decline in patients with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation, and significantly improve respiratory symptoms. Dupilumab also helped improve health-related quality of life measures, which, from my years of experience as a physician, are just as meaningful for patients as being able to breathe easier.”Story continuesCOPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough and breathlessness that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities, but can also lead to anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD, but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. In the U.S. alone, approximately 300,000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.The results presented at ATS and published in NEJM are from the BOREAS trial, which met the primary and all key secondary endpoints. As presented and published, patients receiving Dupixent (n=468) compared to placebo (n=471) added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy experienced a:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p&lt;0.001), the primary endpoint.160 mL improvement in lung function from baseline at 12 weeks versus 77 mL (p&lt;0.001).Numerical improvements were observed as early as 2 weeks, with the benefit versus placebo sustained through 52 weeks (Dupixent: 153 mL, placebo: 70 mL; p&lt;0.001).9.7-point improvement in health-related quality of life (QoL; patient-reported outcome on a scale from 0-100) from baseline at 52 weeks versus a 6.4-point improvement (p=0.002), with numerical improvements observed as early as 4 weeks.2.7-point reduction in respiratory symptom severity (patient-reported outcome on a scale from 0-40) from baseline at 52 weeks versus a 1.6-point reduction (p=0.001).In a pre-specified analysis from a subgroup of patients (Dupixent n=195, placebo n=188) with elevated levels (≥20 ppb) of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) – an airway biomarker of type 2 inflammation – Dupixent treatment also led to a significant 38% reduction in exacerbations compared to placebo at 52 weeks (p=0.005). In this subgroup, Dupixent also led to an improvement in lung function of 232 mL versus 108 mL for placebo at 12 weeks (p=0.002) that was sustained at 52 weeks with an improvement in lung function of 247 mL versus 120 mL for placebo (p=0.003).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent, 6.8% placebo), diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent, 3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent, 3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo, 7.9% Dupixent), hypertension (6.0% placebo, 3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo, 4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were balanced between the two arms (1.7% placebo, 1.5% Dupixent).The second, replicate Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (NOTUS) is ongoing, with data expected in 2024. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in COPD are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Regeneron and Sanofi look forward to discussing the BOREAS data with regulators.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial Program BOREAS is one of two pivotal trials in the Dupixent COPD program. The randomized, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation, as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. Patents with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the trial. During the 52-week treatment period, patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting beta agonists (LABA), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Double maintenance therapy, which included LABA and LAMA, was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death.Key secondary and other hierarchy endpoints included:Change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume over one second [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks in both the overall population and those with FeNO ≥ 20 ppb.Change from baseline at 52 weeks in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score compared to placebo (scale from 0-100).Change from baseline at 52 weeks in the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS: COPD) scale score (scale from 0-40).The annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations in patients with FeNO ≥ 20 ppb.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics, Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33), an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs, four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD who might not have other options.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 600,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

The SPDR S&amp;P Retail Exchange-Traded Fund (NYSEARCA:XRT) that tracks the sector is flat on the year (down 0.30% since January). Investors and traders seem to be taking a “wait-and-see” approach to retail stocks as the U.S. economy and consumer spending slow in the wake of persistently high inflation and elevated interest rates used to lower it.Fears of a coming economic recession are also dampening sentiment around retail stocks. This is unfortunate, as many retailers continue to post strong earnings and have shown great resilience both during the Covid-19 pandemic and throughout the current period of uncertainty. Investors might be surprised at just how strong the underlying fundamentals of many retail stocks are right now.With that said, here are seven retail stocks that are ready for their comeback.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLULULululemon$372.22NKENike$116.98GPSGap Inc.$7.78WMTWalmart$149.53MMacy’s$15.61DKSDick’s Sporting Goods$135.46COSTCostco$495.00Lululemon (LULU)the lululemon (LULU) logo on a mosaic-style wallSource: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.comShares of athletic apparel retailer Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) have been on an upswing since the company issued its latest quarterly earnings at the end of March. LULU stock jumped 15% immediately after the report, as the company issued an across the board earnings beat. Accordingly, LULU stock has seen its share price rise 27% since then. After enduring a bruising 2022, Lululemon’s stock has now managed to rise 22% above where it was trading at a year ago.The company said that strong holiday sales helped it to report earnings per share of $4.40 versus $4.26 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the three months ended January 29 of this year came in at $2.77 billion compared to $2.70 billion that analysts had forecast. Lululemon also issued strong forward guidance, saying it now expects fiscal 2023 revenue of between $9.3 billion and $9.41 billion. That was better than Wall Street consensus expectations of $9.14 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The stock continues to recover.Story continuesNike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comThey haven’t staged a recovery like the one seen in LULU stock, but shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) appear due for a rebound. The frustrating thing about NKE stock is that it has continued to trend lower, despite a string of earnings beat by the company. Year to date, NKE stock is down 2% and the shares are trading 12% below their 52-week high. This despite the fact that Nike’s latest earnings easily beat Wall Street’s forecasts on both the top and bottom lines.At the end of March, Nike reported earnings per share of 79 cents versus 55 cents that was expected by analysts who cover the company. Nike’s revenue in the quarter totaled $12.39 billion compared to $11.47 billion that had been forecast.What seems to be holding the company’s stock down are weak sales in China and bloated inventory levels. Should Nike show improvement in those areas when it next reports earnings on June 28, the stock is likely to pop and finally move higher.Gap Inc. (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockRetailer Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) has had an extremely difficult time in recent months. The clothing company has seen its share price decline 33% year-to-date after it reported a net loss of $273 million, or 75 cents a share, for the three months ended January 28 of this year. The latest loss was 1,600% bigger than the $16 million the company lost a year earlier. In the wake of the brutal quarter, Gap announced several changes within its executive ranks, and that it plans to close 50 to 55 Gap and Banana Republic retail stores across North America.The company went onto forecast that it expects fiscal first quarter net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit range compared to a year earlier, and that it anticipates fiscal 2023 net sales to decrease in the low to mid-single digits. While disheartening, there are some bright spots on the horizon. The company reported that its inventory levels declined 21% year-over-year during its most recent quarter. And Gap is expected to soon announce a new permanent CEO to replace Sonia Syngal, who stepped down last summer.Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) stock has been treading water over the last year, having risen only 1% over the past 12 months. However, WMT stock could be poised for a breakout when the world’s biggest retailer reports its latest earnings on May 18.The company is coming off strong sales at the end of 2022, especially during the December holiday season. Additionally, the company’s discount pricing model positions it to perform strongly should the U.S. economy enter a recession this year.In it previous earnings, Walmart said its revenue and earnings were driven higher by budget-conscious consumers who are visiting its stores in greater numbers, searching for deals as inflation and interest rates remain high. As a result, Walmart reported earnings per share of $1.71 versus the $1.51 that was forecast. Revenue amounted to $164.05 billion, compared to $159.72 billion that was expected among analysts. Looking ahead, the retailer forecast same-store sales for all of this year to rise between 2% and 2.5%.Walmart is not only the biggest retailer in America, but has also become a grocery powerhouse, which is driving increased foot traffic at its outlets.Macy’s (M)Macy's (M) logo on storefront in city with white sky behindSource: Joe Tabacca / Shutterstock.comDepartment store chain Macy’s (NYSE:M) is another retail stock that’s down on its luck. So far this year, M stock has decreased 27%. Notably, the company’s share price is also down 56% over five years.While disappointing, hope arrives for Macy’s shareholders in the form of new management at the company. It was announced at the end of March that CEO Jeff Gennette will retire after more than 40 years at the retailer. Gennette, age 61, plans to step down in February 2024 and will be succeeded by Tony Spring, CEO of the company’s Bloomingdale’s chain.When Gennette became Macy’s CEO in 2017, he undertook a three-year turnaround strategy called “Polaris” that accelerated Macy’s digital growth, closed underperforming stores, and boosted profits as the company faced mounting competition from online retailers. However, the Covid-19 pandemic undid much of the turnaround strategy, as it forced Macy’s to temporarily close its nearly 800 store locations, and operate at reduced capacity. However, Macy’s today has a smaller workforce and network of stores, along with less debt and more online customers after the pandemic.Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)An image of a Dick's Sporting Goods retail locationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comShares of Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) has been trending higher since the sporting goods retailer more than doubled its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders in March of this year. The company announced that it will pay a dividend of $1 per share going forward, which is an increase of 105% from the 48.75 cents paid previously. The dividend increase came after Dick’s smashed expectations for its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings.The company’s same-store sales rose 5.3%, more than double analysts’ consensus forecasts of 2.1% growth, according to Refinitiv data. Additionally, earnings per share came in at $2.93 versus $2.88 that analysts had expected. The retailer said it has kept sales brisk despite inflationary pressures and a slowing economy. The company also said it expects same-store sales growth for the current fiscal year to be flat or up 2%, adding that it has resolved most of its supply chain issues.Year to date, DKS stock has gained 9%. Dick’s Sporting Goods next reports earnings on May 23.Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comLast on this list of retail stocks to buy is another top name that’s been drifting sideways. Over the last year, shares of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock have increased a paltry 1%. The best-in-class grocery retailer is definitely due for a breakout. That could come after the company reports earnings on May 25.Concerns around slowing growth coming out of the pandemic have slowed down the company’s upward stock price momentum. Additionally, Costco’s pricey valuation has turned some investors off. Its price-earnings ratio currently sits at 36-times, which is on the high side.However, investors and analysts may be overlooking the fact that Costco is a recession-resistant stock, meaning the company’s sales are likely to remain strong even during an economic downturn. Costco’s membership fees also provide it with a reliable income stream and earnings stability in good times and bad. Consumers are also fiercely loyal to Costco as evidenced by the fact that its annual membership renewal rate exceeds 90%. And, consumers have further relied on Costco over the past year for cheaper gasoline than they can get at other service stations.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

162,7d8f326d-e4ed-3631-b0fb-45d4d5b950f5,CSCO,2023-05-22,"Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) Stock On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Momentum?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-140019935.html,1684677619,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Cisco Systems' (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock increased significantly by 5.2% over the past week. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Cisco Systems'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:27% = US$11b ÷ US$42b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.27 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 27% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Cisco Systems has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Cisco Systems was able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the last five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Cisco Systems' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 32% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is CSCO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CSCO is currently mispriced by the market.Is Cisco Systems Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 54% (or a retention ratio of 46%) for Cisco Systems suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Moreover, Cisco Systems is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 37% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Cisco Systems has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.
