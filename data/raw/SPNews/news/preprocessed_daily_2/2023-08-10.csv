They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $5.04 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Broad Developed Market ETFs. Before fees and expenses, FNDE seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Co. Index (Net).The Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Company Index (Net) ranks companies in the Russell Emerging Markets Index by measures of fundamental size and tracks the performance of those companies whose fundamental scores are in the top 87.5% of the Russell Emerging Markets Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.39%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 5.13%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing accounts for about 4.08% of the fund's total assets, followed by China Construction Bank Corp H and Hon Hai Precision Industry Ltd.Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 4.08% of FNDE's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, FNDE has gained about 10.56%, and is up about 9.86% in the last one year (as of 08/10/2023). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $23.19 and $28.35.The ETF has a beta of 0.76 and standard deviation of 17.11% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 399 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed Market ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are other ETFs in the space which investors should consider.IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has $72.59 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has $74.17 billion. IEMG has an expense ratio of 0.09% and VWO charges 0.08%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed Market ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We have also covered interesting discussions on different IoT applications. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the World. As of 2022, the global Internet of Things (IoT) market was valued at around $544 billion. It's also estimated to grow significantly in the coming years, with projections indicating it will reach approximately $662 billion in 2023 and a whopping $3.35 trillion by 2030. This impressive growth is expected to result in a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.1% during the forecast period.Many big players in the industry, like Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Siemens AG, have been providing IoT platforms and solutions from deployment services to smart city initiatives and industrial edge solutions. These technologies enable the interconnection of devices using different communication technologies that offer valuable interoperable information without human intervention. If we are to speak about the biggest IoT products in the market, smart watches, smart refrigerators, medical sensors, and fitness trackers would all make it to the list. To read more about the impact of digitalization and artificial intelligence, you should check out our article on Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.How is IoT Making Waves in Industries?IoT has become a pertinent game changer in the healthcare industry by transforming surgical display technology. Through interconnected devices, IoT-enabled surgical displays can integrate data from various medical sources that can provide surgeons with a comprehensive view during medical procedures. Not only does real-time data sharing foster collaboration among medical professionals, it has also added to the quality of patient care and decision-making. Moreover, IoT has facilitated remote monitoring and troubleshooting of displays which has largely reduced downtime and ensures continuous functionality.Story continuesThe generosity of IoT services is not limited to the healthcare sector. In fact, it has tapped into the unexplored potential in urban transportation. The combination of electric bikes (e-bikes) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a win-win idea as E-bikes offer a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional commuting with addressing issues like traffic and pollution. On the other hand, IoT technology enhances e-bikes by providing real-time tracking, remote diagnostics, and seamless integration with other transport options through apps. This data also helps improve urban planning for better infrastructure and traffic management.Challenges for the Internet of Things to Look Out ForThe biggest challenge that comes with the IoT is the implementation of IoT security in the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. As IoT integrates the physical world with computer-based systems, the attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase and hence, attracts malicious actors. In industrial settings, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is especially critical but harder to secure due to long-standing, hard-to-upgrade components with limited maintenance windows.Existing IoT cybersecurity standards from organizations like NIST and ISA are complex which also makes implementation harder as technical documentation for some security standards runs over thousands of pages. Moreover, harmonizing security for both older ""brownfield"" and new ""greenfield"" systems is equally complicated and complex.Another challenge is that government regulations often lag the rapid evolution of IoT technology which leaves businesses without essential information to make decisions. The absence of robust IoT regulations contributes to its security risks, especially as critical devices like medical equipment and cars become connected.Quality control is challenging due to the influx of IoT devices from countries like China that have varying security standards. Thus, experts advocate for strong and universal security standards to address these concerns, as the potential attack surface expands to include more crucial devices. Moreover, the lack of sufficient regulation can raise eyebrows and lead to potential disaster scenarios in the IoT landscape.Let's now move to the biggest IoT companies in the world.20 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the WorldZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe methodology used to rank the Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the world is based on the annual revenue generated by IoT companies in 2022.

This partnership aims to support a cutting-edge solar project in Henderson County, KY, known as Sebree Solar, with a potential capacity of up to 400 megawatts of American-produced energy. The project's initial phase, Sebree Solar I, is scheduled to commence construction in fall 2023.The steel for Sebree Solar I will be supplied by Nucor Steel Gallatin in Ghent, KY. Moreover, this Kentucky-produced steel will play a pivotal role in yet another solar venture, Green River Solar, operated by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. This separate project is projected to generate up to 200 megawatts of electricity. The steel will be utilized in constructing the solar panel racking systems for both projects.Highlighting the broader vision, Nucor underscored the dual impact of sustainable steel production in the ongoing energy transition and the company's commitment to reducing its climate footprint.Anticipated to be operational in December 2025, Sebree Solar I promises substantial benefits to Henderson County. Over its three-decade operational span, the project is projected to contribute around $20 million in additional tax revenues, facilitating crucial investments in local infrastructure and public services.Nucor's collaboration with NextEra Energy Resources is a manifestation of its holistic sustainability strategy, which also complements a prior wind-powered PPA.

This comparison sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the company's value, combining financial assessment with essential company details.CF Industries Holdings: An Undervalued Stock with Strong Growth ProspectsUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the intrinsic value of a stock, derived from a unique method incorporating historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally trade at.CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) is considered modestly undervalued according to GuruFocus' valuation method. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $82.77 per share, CF Industries Holdings stock is believed to be modestly undervalued.Story continuesGiven that CF Industries Holdings is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.CF Industries Holdings: An Undervalued Stock with Strong Growth ProspectsLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength increases the risk of permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy its stock. CF Industries Holdings has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.99, better than 57.87% of companies in the Agriculture industry. The overall financial strength of CF Industries Holdings is ranked at 7 out of 10 by GuruFocus, indicating fair financial strength.CF Industries Holdings: An Undervalued Stock with Strong Growth ProspectsProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those demonstrating consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk.

Its operating margin is 41.09%, ranking better than 95.63% of companies in the Agriculture industry.

Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 53.9%, ranking better than 83.5% of companies in the Agriculture industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, CF Industries Holdings's ROIC is 28.16, and its cost of capital is 9.79.CF Industries Holdings: An Undervalued Stock with Strong Growth ProspectsConclusionIn conclusion, CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) stock is believed to be modestly undervalued.

This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 5.69% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.35% in that time.Walmart will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 17, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Walmart to post earnings of $1.67 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 5.65%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $159.52 billion, up 4.36% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.23 per share and revenue of $637.35 billion.

WMT’s push to compete against Amazon (AMZN) and Target (TGT) includes its own subscription service dubbed Walmart+.Walmart is also focused on partnerships with popular digital native retailers and bringing in more businesses to its third-party marketplace. On top of that, the company is growing its own advertising segment as more customers start their shopping searches on Walmart.com.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s U.S. comps jumped 6.6% last year (up 13% on a two-year stack), while its U.S. e-commerce segment climbed by 12% (23% on a two-year stack). Overall, Walmart has roughly doubled its e-commerce business over the past three years.Walmart is also crucially continuing to innovate and push forward into new tech-focused and automation frontiers at its warehouses, stores, and beyond to compete alongside Amazon and others over the long haul, with an eye toward increasing profitably as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Fundamentals Walmart generated $611 billion in revenue last year (its fiscal 2023) to blow away Amazon’s $514 billion, Apple’s $394 billion, and Exxon Mobil’s $414 billion. WMT posted nearly 7% revenue growth last year to reach that level and continue its impressive run of top-line expansion as it maintains its standing as the one-stop-shopping power.Story continuesWMT posted blowout Q1 (FY24) results in May and upped its guidance as more shoppers of all income levels try to save on essentials.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks estimates call for Walmart U.S. to post 3.7% same-store sales growth in FY24. The company's overall revenue is projected to climb roughly 4% higher both this year and next to hit $660.17 billion next year.Walmart’s adjusted earnings are projected to come in slightly lower this year (-0.95%) but then surge 11% higher next year. And WMT boasts an impressive history of bottom-line beats, including a 12% average beat in the trailing four quarters. And its most recent/most accurate EPS estimates came in above consensus.WMT stock has climbed 80% over the last five years vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 60%, Target’s 57%, and Amazon’s 45%. Walmart has crushed its rival Target over the last year-plus and climbed to new highs because its core business is far more focused on essentials, which are in vogue again after the covid spending boom ended.Despite sitting at new highs, Walmart trades at a 9% discount to its own 10-year highs at 24.5X forward 12-month earnings. On top of that, Walmart recently broke above its previous 2022 highs, which could be a bullish signal.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWalmart still trades below its average Zacks price target. And 80% of the brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys” or “Buys,” with no sell ratings. Walmart’s dividend yields 1.4% vs. its industry’s 1.8%.Walmart is hardly a flashy stock, but those are always useful in any healthy, diversified portfolio. And let’s remember that even though YoY inflation is coming down, consumers are still feeling the burden of higher costs, which benefits Walmart. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to year-ago revenues of $153.22 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Groupon shares have lost about 3.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.2%.What's Next for Groupon?While Groupon has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

QuoteThe company’s wholesale revenues decreased 6% year over year to $742 million, while direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues inched up 4% to $544 million due to a 6% rise in e-commerce revenues, which represented 40% of the total DTC business.

It recorded 3% growth in owned and operated store revenues.Let’s Delve DeeperBy product category, Apparel revenues edged down 5% year over year to $824.7 million, while Footwear revenues increased 5% to $363.7 million. Revenues from the Accessories category inched up 1% to $97.9 million. Meanwhile, Licensing revenues tumbled 10.9% to $25.1 million, driven by softness in the Japanese licensee and North American unit.Net revenues from North America decreased 9.1% to $826.7 million. Meanwhile, revenues from the international business increased 12% (up 15% on a currency-neutral basis) to $485 million.Within the international business, net revenues in EMEA jumped 10.5% to $226.6 million (up 11% at constant currency), 14.5% in Asia-Pacific (up 21% at constant currency), and 12.7% in Latin America (up 5% at constant currency).The company’s gross margin shrunk 60 basis points to 46.1% from the prior-year period due to increased promotions and adverse foreign currency movements, partly offset by supply-chain gains associated with reduced freight expenses. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses dipped 1% to $587 million.The company’s operating income fell to $20.9 million from $34.5 million. The operating margin was 1.6%, down from 2.6% in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesOther Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $703.6 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $594.1 million and total stockholders' equity of $2,005.4 million.

For the current fiscal year, Under Armour expects revenues to be flat to slightly up. It expects the gross margin to be up 25-75 basis points, compared with the prior year's margin of 44.9%, backed by supply-chain tailwinds with respect to lower freight costs. The figure is likely to be partly offset by mix impacts stemming from higher off-price revenues and increased promotions in the company's DTC business. SG&amp;A expenses are anticipated to be flat to slightly up.Under Armour expects the operating income to be between $310 million and $330 million versus the comparable baseline period’s operating income of $284 million.UAA expects earnings in the band of 47-51 cents per share, down from 84 cents per share reported in fiscal 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings of 58 cents a share for the comparable baseline period. Capital expenditures are likely to come in the band of $250-$270 million.For the fiscal second quarter, revenues are likely to be flat to down slightly year over year, including a low single-digit fall in the company’s North American business. This will be partly offset by mid-single-digit increase in the international business. In addition, it anticipates the year's highest revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter.Further, the gross margin is likely to grow nearly 100-150 basis points in the second quarter on gains from lower freight costs, somewhat offset by the ongoing promotional activity. It anticipates the third quarter to be the year’s smallest quarterly gross margin improvement on inventory-management efforts.Second-quarter operating income is expected in the bracket of $115-$135 million, translating to 18-21 cents as earnings per share.

Historically, AJG has successfully utilized strategic acquisitions to enhance its competitive position and drive growth. As the company continues to pursue strategic acquisitions, it strengthens its position as a leading global insurance brokerage and risk management firm.Arthur J. Gallagher has an impressive inorganic story with several buyouts in Brokerage and Risk Management segments. This insurance broker acquired 15 entities in the second quarter of 2023, contributing about $349 million to estimated annualized revenues. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $700 million of revenues, associated with about 55 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared.AJG’s revenues are geographically diversified with strong domestic and international operations, contributing about 67% to total revenues.

22,13da9044-573b-3621-9a7f-69ca5aca3a10,MGM,2023-08-10,The three-year decline in earnings might be taking its toll on MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) shareholders as stock falls 6.6% over the past week,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/three-decline-earnings-might-taking-183312870.html,1691605992,STORY,['MGM'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For instance the MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) share price is 118% higher than it was three years ago. Most would be happy with that. Unfortunately, though, the stock has dropped 6.6% over a week. But note that the broader market is down 0.4% since last week, and this may have impacted MGM Resorts International's share price.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 6.6%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for MGM Resorts International There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the three years of share price growth, MGM Resorts International actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 36% per year.Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Given this situation, it makes sense to look at other metrics too.It could be that the revenue growth of 33% per year is viewed as evidence that MGM Resorts International is growing. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth, and maybe shareholder's faith in better days ahead will be rewarded.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsStory continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that MGM Resorts International has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 33% in the last twelve months. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 11%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand MGM Resorts International better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for MGM Resorts International   you should know about.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

With a relentless set of rate hikes, the Federal Reserve has managed to drive consumer price increases down to 3%, from last June's 9.1%. Part of the decline has been down to base effects, where prices this year aren't much higher than they were during 2022's huge surges.The uptick in the cost of natural gas, gasoline and crude oil over the past few weeks has prompted economists to forecast a rise in Thursday's headline rate of inflation in July to 3.3%, from the previous month's 3.0%, which would mark the first increase since June 2022.Gasoline prices at the pump are up 8% on where they were a month ago, according to the American Automobile Association - an unwelcome development right in the middle of the summer driving season. However, they're still down 5% from last year and well below the eye-watering $5 a gallon in June 2022. Crude oil has risen 15% in the last month, offering a reminder of how the world's biggest exporters might not be able to regulate demand, but they can tweak supply. Natural gas futures have risen to five-month highs as hot weather has kept everyone cranking up the A/C. But they're not only down 65% from this time last year, on a seasonal basis, they're largely back in line with pre-pandemic levels.Traders are all but convinced the Fed will raise rates one last time in September and then look to cut rates some time in 2024. So a higher headline print might, on the surface, risk muddying that view.Looking at stickier measures of inflation, a number of those have been dropping dramatically lately, which would suggest that the broad-based rise in energy prices might not unsettle investors too much.Rent, used-car prices and the cost of ""stickier"" goods are dropping fast. Annual wage growth is almost half what it was in 2020 and the red-hot housing market is losing some steam.Story continuesEconomists at Japanese bank MUFG point to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's index of rent for new tenants - a new tenancy will typically see a higher price rise than a rolling one. The broader CPI rental component tends to lag the Cleveland Fed's new-tenant rental index by six months, they say, meaning that rents could well be the next shoe to drop in the inflation story and could help offset upside risk from energy prices, MUFG say.The Atlanta Fed compiles an index of core sticky consumer prices - goods or services for which the cost changes far more slowly. In June, the index showed a rise of 5.6%. This was up from last June's 5.4% rate, but it marked the slowest annual increase since August 2021, of just 20 basis points.The Atlanta Fed includes a variety of goods and services in the index and assigns them a rating based on their influence on overall CPI. The biggest weight is food away from home, with a score of 6.5, followed by rent for primary residence, at 6.0 and recreation at 5.7. The index includes baby and toddler clothes, vehicle maintenance and repair and car insurance among others.Used cars were one of the major inflationary goods when the pandemic struck, as global supply chains snarled up and and created a huge shortage of new vehicles.Second-hand car prices fell for 11 months in a row in July. This is their longest consecutive stretch of declines in a decade, after an unbroken 27 months of increases to August 2022 and are now nearly 12% below where they were this time last year, according to the most recent Manheim used vehicle index. In April 2021, the index showed an annual rise of 54%.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:* July consumer price index (CPI)* Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly is interviewed on Yahoo Finance, 0800 PDT/1100 EDT/1500 GMT.* Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic gives welcome remarks at a webinar, 1500 EDT/1900 GMT.(Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)]"

In the first ten days of August, exports of Malaysian palm oil products rose 17.5% to 383,795 tons, AmSpec Agri Malaysia said on Thursday.(Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav; editing by David Evans)]"

Brent hit a six-month high on Wednesday, while WTI touched its strongest level since November 2022.U.S. CPI data awaitedSentiment was largely strained ahead of key U.S. consumer price index data due later in the day.Markets were on edge as analysts forecast a potentially stronger reading for July, which could indicate that inflation remained sticky and well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% annual target range.High inflation is expected to provide more impetus to the Fed to maintain its hawkish stance- a scenario that could weigh on economic activity in the remainder of the year, potentially hurting oil demand.The prospect of higher-for-longer rates also boosted the dollar in recent weeks. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for international buyers.Tighter supplies, robust U.S. fuel demand underpin oil pricesWhile data released on Wednesday showed U.S. inventories unexpectedly grew in the week to August 4, it also showed a much bigger-than-expected draw in gasoline and distillate stockpiles.The reading showed that fuel demand in the world’s largest fuel consumer remained robust despite higher interest rates and inflation.The reading also spurred hopes that global oil markets will tighten further in the coming months, following extended supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia.Story continuesChinese demand recovery in question after weak dataA slew of weak economic readings from China drove up concerns over a demand recovery in the world’s largest oil importer. China’s oil imports also sank to their second-lowest level this year in July, as a post-COVID economic recovery ran out of steam.But Beijing is now expected to roll out more stimulus measures in the coming months, which could help push up economic activity and oil demand in the country.Related ArticlesOil prices edge lower from 2023 highs, U.S. inflation awaitedGold at 1-mth low, copper steadies ahead of U.S. CPITexas power use hits another record during heat wave]"

(ATSI), a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), has upgraded eight miles of two high-voltage power lines in Lake and Geauga counties in Ohio, stringing new wires that can handle additional demand if other lines in the region are out of service. The project will strengthen the regional transmission system and enhance service reliability for 7,000 customers of The Illuminating Company.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The two 138-kilovolt power lines share 63 transmission towers along the eight-mile section and run from the Leroy Center Substation in Leroy Township through Concord Township in Lake County and Hambden and Chardon townships in Geauga County. The new wires installed will reduce the risk of overloads on the lines, which are now able to carry increased power flow in the event of unplanned service interruptions on other transmission lines.As part of the $7 million project, ATSI also installed new components and insulators as needed along the route to support the wires. Helicopter crews performed the majority of the upgrades along the eight-mile section. Helicopter crews can perform the work faster and more efficiently than ground crews, which require the creation of access roads for large trucks and equipment.The project was identified in conjunction with PJM, the electric grid operator for FirstEnergy's service territory, as part of its reliability planning analysis. The upgraded segment serves the Pawnee Substation, which delivers power to approximately 7,000 customers of The Illuminating Company.The project is part of Energizing the Future, a multi-year initiative designed to upgrade FirstEnergy's transmission system with advanced equipment and technologies that will reinforce the power grid and help reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages. Since 2014, FirstEnergy has upgraded or replaced existing power lines, incorporated smart technology into the grid and upgraded dozens of substations with new equipment and enhanced security features. Through 2022, FirstEnergy had invested more than $10 billion in the Energizing the Future initiative.Story continuesA second phase of the project that extends an additional eight miles to the Mayfield Substation in Chester Township, Geauga County, is planned for 2024. This fall, ATSI also will be upgrading two transmission lines on parallel structures in the corridor that run 16 miles from the Leroy Center Substation to the Mayfield Substation.ATSI provides transmission services in Ohio and in the western portion of Pennsylvania and owns or maintains more than 8,100 miles of transmission lines, substations and other facilities.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

36,66157748-fed7-392d-8e0c-a94d36e6ce2e,FLS,2023-08-10,We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Flowserve (NYSE:FLS) Passed With Ease,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ran-stock-scan-earnings-growth-173158398.html,1691602318,STORY,['FLS'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Flowserve (NYSE:FLS). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Flowserve How Quickly Is Flowserve Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Flowserve grew its EPS by 16% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Flowserve maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 14% to US$4.0b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Flowserve's forecast profits?Are Flowserve Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Flowserve, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they hold US$26m worth of its stock. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Despite being just 0.5% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Story continuesIs Flowserve Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Flowserve is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Flowserve (1 is a bit concerning!) that you need to be mindful of.Although Flowserve certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

North America revenue in the first quarter decreased 10% to $632 million. Results included approximately 5 points of negative impact from a previously reported shift in timing of Spring product receipts into the fourth quarter last year, as the Company returned to a more normalized cadence of seasonal wholesale shipments post-pandemic. In retail, comparable store sales in North America were down 6%, including an 8% decrease in digital commerce and a 5% decrease in brick and mortar stores. North America wholesale revenue decreased 16% driven by the normalized timing of Spring shipments following the prior year's global supply chain disruptions.Europe Revenue.

Results included approximately 5 points of positive impact from earlier timing of wholesale shipments to maximize full-price selling.

Adjusted gross margin was 68.8%, 80 basis points above the prior year on a reported basis and up 130 basis points in constant currency. Gross margins were driven by AUR growth across all regions, lower freight and favorable channel and geographic mix shifts, more than offsetting continued pressure from raw material costs and foreign currency.Operating Expenses. Operating expenses in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 were $866 million on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were $830 million, up 1% to last year. Adjusted operating expense rate was 55.5%, compared to 55.2% in the prior year period. Higher compensation and rent &amp; occupancy costs were partly offset by lower marketing expense due to a planned shift in timing of marketing investments to the second quarter of the fiscal year.Operating Income. Operating income for the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 was $166 million and operating margin was 11.1% on a reported basis. Adjusted operating income was $200 million and operating margin was 13.4%, 70 basis points above the prior year.

North America operating income in the first quarter was $125 million on a reported basis and $124 million on an adjusted basis.

Foreign currency negatively impacted adjusted operating margin rate by 40 basis points in the first quarter.Asia Operating Income.

This compared to an effective tax rate of approximately 24% on both a reported and adjusted basis in the prior year period.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow ReviewThe Company ended the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 with $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt, compared to $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2023.Inventory at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 was $1.2 billion, up 1% compared to the prior year period, including increases in Asia and Europe to support growth initiatives largely offset by a decline in North America.The Company repurchased approximately $50 million of Class A Common Stock in the first quarter.Full Year Fiscal 2024 and Second Quarter OutlookThe Company's outlook is based on its best assessment of the current macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and other consumer spending-related headwinds, foreign currency volatility, and the war in Ukraine, among others. The full year Fiscal 2024 and second quarter guidance excludes any potential restructuring-related and other net charges that may be incurred in future periods, as described in the ""Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this press release.For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 20 basis points in Fiscal 2024.The Company continues to expect operating margin for Fiscal 2024 to expand approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. Foreign currency is expected to have a roughly neutral impact on operating margin in Fiscal 2024. Gross margin is now expected to increase approximately 100 basis points in constant currency, compared to the previous outlook of 50 to 100 basis points expansion, with reduced freight costs, favorable geographic mix and continued growth in AUR more than offsetting product cost inflation. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by approximately 30 basis points in Fiscal 2024. Gross margin expansion is expected to more than offset higher operating expenses as a percent of revenue as the Company invests in long-term strategic growth initiatives, notably digital and key city ecosystem expansion.For the second quarter, the Company expects revenue to be flat to up slightly to last year in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to benefit revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points.Operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.0% on a reported basis and 9.0% to 9.5% in constant currency. The Company expects constant currency gross margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points to be more than offset by higher operating expenses due to the timing of strategic investments in the period, with a higher proportion of marketing and ecosystem investments in the second quarter of the fiscal year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margin by approximately 10 basis points in the quarter.Full year Fiscal 2024 tax rate is now expected in the range of approximately 23% to 24%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws, while second quarter tax rate is expected in the range of 21% to 22%.The Company now expects capital expenditures for Fiscal 2024 of approximately $250 million to $275 million.Conference CallAs previously announced, the Company will host a conference call and live online webcast today, Thursday, August 10, 2023, at 9:00 A.M.

Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on the Company's reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP""), the Company's discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. The Company presents constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to its reported operating results. The Company uses constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how its businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in the Company's businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company's operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.This earnings release also includes certain other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures relating to the impact of charges and other items as described herein. The Company uses non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, among other things, to evaluate its operating performance and to better represent the manner in which it conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods. While the Company considers non-U.S. GAAP measures useful in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, nor act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-U.S. GAAP measures reported by other companies.Adjustments made during the fiscal periods presented include charges recorded in connection with the Company's restructuring activities, as well as certain other charges (benefits) associated with other non-recurring events, as described in the footnotes to the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures above. The income tax benefit (provision) has been adjusted for the tax-related effects of these charges, which were calculated using the respective statutory tax rates for each applicable jurisdiction. Included in this earnings release are reconciliations between the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures before and after these adjustments.Additionally, the Company's full year Fiscal 2024 and second quarter guidance excludes any potential restructuring-related and other charges that may be incurred in future periods. The Company is not able to provide a full reconciliation of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP as it is not known at this time if and when any such charges may be incurred in the future. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the Company's non-U.S. GAAP based financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures cannot be provided at this time given the uncertain nature of any such potential charges that may be incurred in future periods.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230809096837/en/ContactsInvestor Relations:Corinna Van der Ghinstir@ralphlauren.com OrCorporate Communicationsrl-press@ralphlauren.com]"

UAA delivered better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2024, wherein revenues and earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both the top and bottom lines fell year over year. However, the company reaffirmed guidance for fiscal 2024.The company reported adjusted earnings of 2 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share. The company recorded earnings of 20 cents a share in the year-ago period.Meanwhile, net revenues of $1,317 million came ahead of the consensus estimate of $1,298 million but fell 2% on a year-over-year basis. The metric also slipped 1% on a currency-neutral basis.Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUnder Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUnder Armour, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteThe company’s wholesale revenues decreased 6% year over year to $742 million, while direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues inched up 4% to $544 million due to a 6% rise in e-commerce revenues, which represented 40% of the total DTC business. Sturdy results in the e-commerce and retail channels aided the performance. It recorded 3% growth in owned and operated store revenues.Let’s Delve DeeperBy product category, Apparel revenues edged down 5% year over year to $824.7 million, while Footwear revenues increased 5% to $363.7 million. Revenues from the Accessories category inched up 1% to $97.9 million. Meanwhile, Licensing revenues tumbled 10.9% to $25.1 million, driven by softness in the Japanese licensee and North American unit.Net revenues from North America decreased 9.1% to $826.7 million. Meanwhile, revenues from the international business increased 12% (up 15% on a currency-neutral basis) to $485 million.Within the international business, net revenues in EMEA jumped 10.5% to $226.6 million (up 11% at constant currency), 14.5% in Asia-Pacific (up 21% at constant currency), and 12.7% in Latin America (up 5% at constant currency).The company’s gross margin shrunk 60 basis points to 46.1% from the prior-year period due to increased promotions and adverse foreign currency movements, partly offset by supply-chain gains associated with reduced freight expenses. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses dipped 1% to $587 million.The company’s operating income fell to $20.9 million from $34.5 million. The operating margin was 1.6%, down from 2.6% in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesOther Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $703.6 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $594.1 million and total stockholders' equity of $2,005.4 million. The inventory jumped 38% to $1.3 billion.For fiscal 2024, management expects capital expenditures in the range of $250-$270 million.FY24 GuidanceManagement reiterated view for fiscal 2024. For the current fiscal year, Under Armour expects revenues to be flat to slightly up. It expects the gross margin to be up 25-75 basis points, compared with the prior year's margin of 44.9%, backed by supply-chain tailwinds with respect to lower freight costs. The figure is likely to be partly offset by mix impacts stemming from higher off-price revenues and increased promotions in the company's DTC business. SG&amp;A expenses are anticipated to be flat to slightly up.Under Armour expects the operating income to be between $310 million and $330 million versus the comparable baseline period’s operating income of $284 million.UAA expects earnings in the band of 47-51 cents per share, down from 84 cents per share reported in fiscal 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings of 58 cents a share for the comparable baseline period. Capital expenditures are likely to come in the band of $250-$270 million.For the fiscal second quarter, revenues are likely to be flat to down slightly year over year, including a low single-digit fall in the company’s North American business. This will be partly offset by mid-single-digit increase in the international business. In addition, it anticipates the year's highest revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter.Further, the gross margin is likely to grow nearly 100-150 basis points in the second quarter on gains from lower freight costs, somewhat offset by the ongoing promotional activity. It anticipates the third quarter to be the year’s smallest quarterly gross margin improvement on inventory-management efforts.Second-quarter operating income is expected in the bracket of $115-$135 million, translating to 18-21 cents as earnings per share. Further, inventory is estimated to be up at a mid to high single-digit percentage rate at the end of the fiscal second quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has risen 0.2% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s 1.2% fall.Eye These Solid PicksSome better-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and Ralph Lauren RL.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), at present.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Ralph Lauren is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for RL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.19 per share for RL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for RL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.86% heading into earnings season.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRalph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRalph Lauren Corporation price-eps-surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that RL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Marathon Oil's shares before the 15th of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.10 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.40 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Marathon Oil has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current stock price of $26.27. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Oil Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Marathon Oil paid out just 12% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 8.8% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's positive to see that Marathon Oil's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Marathon Oil's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 43% per annum for the past five years. Marathon Oil looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Marathon Oil's dividend payments per share have declined at 5.2% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. Marathon Oil is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits.The Bottom LineIs Marathon Oil worth buying for its dividend? Marathon Oil has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. There's a lot to like about Marathon Oil, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for Marathon Oil (1 is concerning!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital via buybacks and dividends.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins.

The surge comes ahead of a supply unlock that could add selling pressure, data suggests.Just over 2% of the APT supply – worth $33 million at current prices – is set to be unlocked on August 12 at 05:30 am UTC, data shows. This is part of a planned move and will decrease locked tokens to 80% of the total supply.Unlocks increase the circulating supply of any token in the open market, adding bearish sentiment if holders choose to sell and demand fails to keep up – causing prices to plunge quickly.As such, Aptos has previously been criticized by the broader crypto community for predatory tokenomics and concerns over the distribution of tokens – where core contributors, investors and the Aptos Foundation received almost half the 1 billion tokens issued.In contrast, Ethereum allocated just 9.9% of ether (ETH) supply to the founding team and another 9.9% to the Ethereum Foundation during its 2015 issuance.Wednesday’s price surge came as Aptos Labs, a blockchain started by former Meta Inc. employees, said it was expanding its tools and services using Microsoft's artificial intelligence technology. Planned products include a chatbot called Aptos Assistant and AI tools for smart contract programming.At the time of writing, APT was up over 9% at $7.31.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Sysco, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Sysco ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sysco?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Sysco. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Sysco, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sysco. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. The second and third largest shareholders are Wellington Management Group LLP and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.4%.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SyscoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Sysco Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$60m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Sysco. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Sysco , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

63,6b5518c3-b2d5-365c-825c-80c58b248f2e,SLB,2023-08-10,Helium Wars: Why Are Tech Giants Fighting Over This Rare Gas?,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helium-wars-why-tech-giants-230100691.html,1691622060,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CVX', 'SU', 'XOM', 'LIN', 'BKR', 'SLB', 'IMO', 'CNQ']","[A daunting list of key industries the world over is now wondering where their future supplies of helium will come from.What battery metals are to gigafactories, helium is to everything from scientific research, medical technology and high-tech manufacturing to space exploration and national defense.None can survive without helium—a non-renewable natural resource typically recovered from natural gas deposits. Helium is unique among all elements because it can reach ultra-cold temperatures making possible everything from magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) and semiconductors (which are now suffering from a supply shortage) to fiber optic telecommunications and even space exploration.Multi-billion-dollar industries depend on this; yet, we have been in a state of helium shortage since 2016. And in 2022, the war in Ukraine effectively cut off helium supplies from Russia, a leading exporter with big expansion plans.An energy crisis deprived industries of even more, with the world’s largest producers forced to abandon helium in favor of natural gas rationing.Now, with North American industries now experiencing a supply squeeze and geopolitical risk putting other major suppliers out of reach, Avanti Helium Corp.’s (TSXV: AVN; OTC: ARGYF) two recent discoveries and first production planned for the first-quarter of next year, is a propitious development.And with helium worth hundreds of times more than natural gas, the opportunity is overripe for energy-sector investors.Two Helium Discoveries Amid a Supply SqueezeThese Montana-based helium discoveries are larger than expected, and have the potential to redraw the helium map in North America’s favor, expanding from Montana into Alberta, Canada.In June last year, Avanti discovered 187 million cubic feet of net recoverable helium gas, based on a raw gas estimate of 17 billion cubic feet recoverable and net helium concentration of 1.1% at its WNG 11-22 well in the Greater Knappen Property in Montana.Story continuesThen, in January this year, Avanti expanded the pool with the second well flowing 20 million cubic feet per day, also at Greater Knappen. That flow rate and helium percentage was more than double Avanti’s initial expectations.The two wells will be brought into production in the first quarter of next year.All of this helium comes from the development of a single pool on the Greater Knappen property, and there are approximately 10 more pools to drill.Avanti’s Greater Knappen property is an 82,000-acre opportunity for North America. With 100% interest in this prospective helium play, and1-2% helium in its discoveries. This gives Avanti a clear North American advantage.Risk-Reduction with a Major Midstream DealJust days ago, Avanti (TSXV: AVN; OTC: ARGYF) signed an agreement with a veteran helium midstream company that already has over a dozen helium plants across North America. That is the biggest de-risking driver since Avanti’s two discoveries because it fast-tracks the commercialization of Avanti’s helium recovery plant with raw gas from its Sweetgrass helium pool. The plant is now set to begin operations in the first quarter of 2024.The agreement with private company IACX gives Avanti even more experience, CAPEX power, supply-chain strength, and existing component inventory because IACX already operates over a dozen helium plants across North America.The agreement calls for the construction, financing, and operations of a helium recovery plant that will process raw gas from Avanti’s Sweetgrass Helium pool in the Greater Knappen project. The plant is designed to initially process 10 million cubic feet per day of raw gas beginning in Q1 2024, with the option to ramp up to 15 million cubic feet per day.The deal is also fee-based. For investors, that means it will primarily be paid out of operational cashflow from the plant, making it unnecessary for Avanti to do a major equity raise, which would dilute shares, or obtain high-interest debt.Avanti will feed its raw gas to the new plant via pipeline. Once in the plant, the raw gas is concentrated into 98% pure “crude” helium. Because “crude” helium is still gaseous, it is transported further to a liquefaction plant where the chilling process removes the remaining nitrogen, leaving a helium purity of 99.999% - the market premium, and cools the helium to -269C, the temperature at which it liquifies.All the steps of this process amount to ~$211/Mcf (thousand cubic feet) initially and declining to ~$163/Mcf by year three. Additional costs such as royalties and power are expected to total ~$70/Mcf or less. That means that the total operational costs of marketed liquid helium will be approximately $280-$230/Mcf over five years.While last year, helium prices spiked because hopes for plentiful supply were dashed, selling for $500 Mcf all the way up to $1,000/Mcf depending on purity and grade, prices remain opaque and vary from deal to deal.Some insight comes from the recent contract announced by Royal Helium in early July. That contract was for $625/Mcf, without trucking and liquefaction. With trucking and liquefaction, that would make the gross price ~$750/Mcf. Using these numbers, we can arrive at a potential netback for Avanti of $470-$520/Mcf.With the new helium recovery unit initially producing 10 MMcfd (million cubic feet per day) and ramping up in an estimated nine months to 15MMcfd, this could potentially position Avanti to earn as much as $14.9 million annually, using a netback of $500/Mcf. When it ramps up, the earnings could shoot up to as much as $22 million or more annually.Beacon Securities, which has initiated coverage of Avanti, forecasts the company to generate $22.5 million of EBITDA in 2024.Beacon also expects Avanti to resume exploration drilling on the Greater Knappen project once it is generating EBITDA early next year, with additional expectations that new drilling will lead to another helium recovery plant by the third quarter of 2025, with EBITDA then possibly nearing the $40 million mark.What Beacon is now looking for in the news flow is a forward movement on Avanti’s plans to finance the pipeline for the Sweetgrass site as well as an independent offtake agreement—both of which Beacon expects to hear about in the coming months.Beacon referred to Avanti’s (TSXV: AVN; OTC: ARGYF) midstream agreement with IACX as “a major de-risking step in AVN’s path to production of liquified helium that should receive a price of US$750/mcf or more”. Beacon’s forecast is that AVN is trading at an EV/EBIDTA multiple of 2.4x for next year, and only 0.9x for 2025. “With a compelling macro backdrop in the critical helium sector, we believe that multiple should be much higher”. Beacon Securities maintains its $2.25 price target for AVN.A Critical Junction for American HeliumPrior to 2016, helium supplies were not a concern. The U.S. was stockpiling helium as a matter of national interest beginning in the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War. That strategic supply of helium was stored at the Federal Helium Reserve in Amarillo, Texas, with controlled pricing.Nearly half of the U.S. supply of helium came from this reserve. That reserve is dwindling, and earlier this month, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced that all the assets of the federal helium system would be auctioned off for sale in November.  To offset this lost domestic supply of helium, a pure play exploration industry is developing.The helium land grab is in full force, as explorers search for new sources of helium in commercial quantities. That means fields with high helium contents. Montana and Canada’s Saskatchewan province are two major venues for this, as Avanti has already discovered.This also means that helium explorers need to have significant natural gas exploration and production experience. The Avanti team has exactly this, in one of the largest oil and gas discoveries in North American history: Canada’s Montney Shale.  Avanti CEO Chris Bakker played a significant role in the Montney’s development on behalf of giant Encana.  Now, with the global helium market set to hit nearly $6.5 billion in just three years, Avanti is a clear industry leader with two discoveries, much more to explore, and a midstream deal to get its first helium recovery unit up and running by the beginning of next year.Other companies to keep an eye on:Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

""The key takeaway is that people recognize it's better than it was, but it will not go back to the way that it was in 2019,"" said Interos industry analyst Tim White. Labor and raw material constraints, as well as unforeseen disruptions remain supply chain headwinds, White said.Executives were surveyed in the U.S., Canada and the UK and Ireland.Globally, companies on Wednesday cited supply chains as an ongoing challenge, with Danish-listed turbine maker Vestas saying it expects disruption to continue for the rest of 2023.Aptiv PLC said despite improvements in the supply chain, higher semiconductor pricing remains a challenge.(Reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal; editing by Jonathan Oatis, Kirsten Donovan)]"

Reported net sales growth was driven by 1) +4.0 percentage points from the acquisition of the Gateway infant formula facility and U.S. &amp; Canadian Good Start® infant formula brand (""Gateway""), 2) +2.3 percentage points of growth from the acquisition of HRA, including an unfavorable impact of -0.9 percentage points related to distributor transition sales returns as part of the integration plan to capture synergies, and 3) -0.2 percentage points from foreign currency translation.Organic net sales growth of 0.8% was driven primarily by 1) +4.8 percentage points from strategic pricing actions, and 2) new products sales and growth in e-commerce. This growth was partially offset by 1) -2.7 percentage points from purposeful SKU prioritization actions to enhance margins as part of the Company's Supply Chain Reinvention Program, and 2) -1.1 percentage points from a weaker allergy season in the U.S. compared to the prior year.Reported gross margin was 35.9%, a 270 basis point increase versus the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin expanded 220 basis points to 38.7% driven by higher margin acquisitions, strategic pricing actions and benefits from the purposeful SKU prioritization actions noted above. These positive factors were partially offset by the impacts from inflation and lower manufacturing productivity in the U.S. Nutrition business stemming from the FDA's evolving regulations on infant formula manufacturing.Reported operating income was $57 million compared to a loss of $7 million in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income grew $21 million, or 17.9%, to $137 million driven by higher gross profit flow-through from acquisitions and strategic pricing actions. These increases were partially offset by 1) higher operating expenses, driven primarily by the addition of HRA and Gateway, 2) the unfavorable impact from inflation, 3) lower manufacturing productivity in the U.S. Nutrition business, and 4) $9 million from the HRA distributor transition sales returns.Reported net income was $9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to a reported net loss of $65 million, or ($0.48) per diluted share, in the prior year. Excluding certain charges as outlined in Table I, second quarter 2023 adjusted net income was $87 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $59 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, in the prior year.

Reported net sales growth was driven by +6.2 percentage points from the addition of Gateway. Organic net sales decreased 2.7% as strategic pricing actions and new product sales were more than offset by 1) -4.1 percentage points due to purposeful SKU prioritization actions to enhance margins as part of the Company's Supply Chain Reinvention Program, 2) a weaker allergy season compared to the prior year adversely impacting net sales by -1.8 percentage points, and 3) lower sales volumes in contract manufacturing. Primary category drivers are provided below.NutritionNet sales of $165 million increased 31.7% due primarily to the Gateway acquisition and growth in legacy infant formula products. This growth was partially offset by lower net sales in store brand oral electrolytes and the discontinuation of nutritional drinks.Upper RespiratoryNet sales of $138 million decreased 5.6% due primarily to lower net sales of allergy products driven by a weaker allergy season compared to the prior year. This headwind was partially offset by higher net sales of cough cold products, including store brand Cough DM and Guaifenesin-based offerings.Digestive HealthNet sales of $127 million increased 1.3% due primarily to higher net sales of store brand Omeprazole and new products, including Polyethylene Glycol 3350 Orange, which were partially offset by lower net sales from contract manufacturing.Pain &amp; Sleep-AidsNet sales of $97 million decreased 5.1% due primarily to purposeful SKU prioritization in adult analgesic offerings to focus capacity on higher margin products, partially offset by higher demand for children's analgesics products.Oral CareNet sales of $77 million increased 0.4% due primarily to higher net sales of Plackers® and store brand teeth whitening products, which were mostly offset by lower sales of manual toothbrushes, including branded Firefly® and REACH®, and store brand offerings.Healthy LifestyleNet sales of $67 million were flat due primarily to increased consumer demand for store brand smoking cessation products being offset by lost distribution at a specific customer.Skin CareNet sales of $51 million increased 4.5% due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including Mederma® and Compeed®.Women's HealthNet sales of $13 million increased 4.2% due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including ella®.

Adjusted operating income increased $9 million, or 9.0%, to $114 million as gross profit flow-through and lower distribution costs were partially offset by higher operating expenses, driven primarily by the addition of Gateway.Consumer Self-Care International SegmentSecond Quarter 2023 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior YearReported Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange AdjustmentConstant Currency Net SalesNet Acquisitions &amp; Divestitures AdjustmentOrganic Net Sales GrowthCSCI12.4 %0.4 %12.8 %(5.7) %7.1 %CSCI reported net sales increased 12.4% and constant currency net sales increased 12.8%.

These statements relate to future events or the Company's future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements of the Company or its industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" ""expect,"" ""forecast,"" ""plan,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""predict,"" ""potential"" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including: supply chain impacts on the Company's business, including those caused or exacerbated by armed conflict, trade and other economic sanctions and/or disease; general economic, credit, and market conditions; the impact of the war in Ukraine and any escalation thereof, including the effects of economic and political sanctions imposed by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and other countries related thereto; the outbreak or escalation of conflict in other regions where we do business; future impairment charges, if we determine that the carrying amount of specific assets may not be recoverable from the expected future cash flows of such assets; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than the Company does; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; resolution of uncertain tax positions and any litigation relating thereto, ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; uncertainty regarding the Company's ability to obtain and maintain its regulatory approvals; potential costs and reputational impact of product recalls or sales halts; potential adverse changes to U.S. and foreign tax, healthcare and other government policy; the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its variants; the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases (or the absence thereof); fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; the Company's ability to achieve the benefits expected from the sale of its Rx business and the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with that transaction may exceed the Company's estimates or adversely affect the Company's business or operations; the Company's ability to achieve the benefits expected from the acquisitions of Héra SAS (""HRA Pharma"") and Nestlé's Gateway infant formula plant along with the U.S. and Canadian rights to the GoodStart® infant formula brand and other related formula brands (""Gateway"") and/or the risks that the Company's synergy estimates are inaccurate or that the Company faces higher than anticipated integration or other costs in connection with the acquisitions; risks associated with the integration of HRA Pharma and Gateway, including the risk that growth rates are adversely affected by any delay in the integration of sales and distribution networks; the consummation and success of other announced and unannounced acquisitions or dispositions, and the Company's ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and the Company's ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other strategic initiatives and investments, including the Company's ability to achieve the expected benefits from its Supply Chain Reinvention Program.  Adverse results with respect to pending litigation could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operating results, cash flows and liquidity, and could ultimately require the use of corporate assets to pay damages, reducing assets that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. These and other important factors, including those discussed under ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as the Company's subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.Non-GAAP MeasuresThis press release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A ""non-GAAP financial measure"" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the following non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release:net sales growth on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, divested businesses, and the impact of currency,adjusted gross profit,adjusted net income,adjusted operating income,adjusted diluted earnings per share,constant currency net sales growth, adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share,adjusted gross margin, andadjusted operating margin.These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and, where applicable, with companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements and is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.Non-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which include adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, constant currency adjusted diluted EPS, constant currency adjusted operating income, adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. The Company also discloses net sales growth excluding the impact of currency on an organic basis. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past and present underlying operating results, and also facilitate analysis of the Company's operating performance and acquisition and divestiture trends.A copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is available on the Company's website at www.perrigo.com. PERRIGO COMPANY PLCCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJuly 1,2023July 2,2022July 1,2023July 2,2022Net sales$             1,193.1$             1,121.7$             2,374.8$             2,196.2Cost of sales765.1749.61,532.91,486.3Gross profit428.0372.1841.9709.9Operating expensesDistribution28.629.557.253.9Research and development32.231.563.360.8Selling171.1150.8339.0286.4Administration132.6157.8267.6280.1Restructuring6.79.510.213.1Other operating (income) expense, net—(0.1)(0.8)0.8Total operating expenses371.2379.0736.5695.1Operating income (loss)56.8(6.9)105.414.8Interest expense, net44.038.387.674.1Other (income) expense, net(9.7)53.8(9.0)52.7Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes22.5(108.3)26.8(121.3)Income tax expense (benefit)13.6(43.4)19.0(55.1)Income (loss) from continuing operations8.9(64.9)7.8(66.2)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(0.5)(0.2)(2.4)(1.4)Net income (loss)$                    8.4$                (65.1)$                    5.4$                (67.6)Earnings (loss) per shareBasicContinuing operations$                  0.07$                (0.48)$                  0.06$                (0.49)Discontinued operations——(0.02)(0.01)Basic earnings (loss) per share$                  0.06$                (0.48)$                  0.04$                (0.50)DilutedContinuing operations$                  0.06$                (0.48)$                  0.06$                (0.49)Discontinued operations——(0.02)(0.01)Diluted earnings (loss) per share$                  0.06$                (0.48)$                  0.04$                (0.50)Weighted-average shares outstandingBasic135.3134.6135.1134.3Diluted136.6134.6136.5134.3 PERRIGO COMPANY PLCCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)July 1,2023December 31,2022AssetsCash and cash equivalents$               555.2$                600.7Accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $8.1 and $6.8, respectively754.1697.1Inventories1,167.51,150.3Prepaid expenses and other current assets296.2271.8Total current assets2,773.02,719.9Property, plant and equipment, net918.3926.3Operating lease assets206.9217.1Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets3,657.83,549.0Definite-lived intangible assets, net3,030.83,230.2Deferred income taxes6.37.1Other non-current assets371.6367.7Total non-current assets8,191.78,297.4Total assets$          10,964.7$          11,017.3Liabilities and Shareholders' EquityAccounts payable$               470.5$                537.3Payroll and related taxes104.4136.4Accrued customer programs174.3139.1Other accrued liabilities261.7250.2Accrued income taxes7.614.4Current indebtedness38.436.2Total current liabilities1,056.91,113.6Long-term debt, less current portion4,055.94,070.4Deferred income taxes344.6368.2Other non-current liabilities658.7623.0Total non-current liabilities5,059.25,061.6Total liabilities6,116.16,175.2Contingencies -

The median return for institutional asset owners included in the Northern Trust All Funds Over $100 million plan universe was up 2.3% for the quarter ending June 30, 2023.The Northern Trust Universe tracks the performance of more than 400 large U.S. institutional investment plans, with a combined asset value of more than $1.28 trillion, which subscribe to performance measurement services as part of Northern Trust's asset servicing offerings.The Northern Trust Corporate (ERISA) universe median return was 0.8% for the quarter, trailing the Northern Trust Public Funds universe, where the median plan was up 2.3% for the quarter, and the Northern Trust Foundation and Endowment (F&amp;E) universe, which produced a 2.6% median return for the quarter.""The Federal Reserve increased the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points during the quarter and commented that future rates increases would be on the low end of investor expectations. This fueled optimism that inflation is receding,"" said Amy Garrigues, global head of Investment Risk and Analytical Services at Northern Trust. ""This, combined with continued U.S. GDP growth and global optimism in the technology sector resulting from advancements in artificial intelligence, allowed equity markets to post strong results for the quarter.""The Northern Trust U.S. Equity Program universe generated a 7.6% median return for the second quarter. Large cap stocks continued to outperform small cap stocks in the quarter, with the Russell 1000 large cap index up 8.6% compared to the Russell 2000 small cap index, which returned 5.2% for the quarter.The Northern Trust U.S. Fixed Income program universe median return was down -0.5% for the quarter. Negative results were driven by an increase in interest rates, with the U.S. 10-year treasury bond yield rising from 3.48% to 3.81%, and continued rising interest rates in developed markets, most notably in the UK and Australia, which experienced high inflation during the quarter.Story continuesERISA plan universe median one-, three- and five-years returns were 3.6%, 1.9% and 4.4% respectively. The U.S. fixed income asset class remains the largest holding in ERISA plans, with a median allocation of 52.8%, putting pressure on the segment returns relative to peers in the Public Funds and F&amp;E segments, where U.S. Fixed Income segment allocations are 22% and 8% respectively.Public Funds universe median multi-period returns for the one-, three- and five-year periods stand at 6.6%, 8.1% and 6.1% respectively. The median second quarter allocations to U.S. and international equity were 28.6% and 12.3% respectively. The median exposure to US fixed income for Public Funds decreased to 21.5%.Foundations &amp; Endowments universe median one-, three- and five-years returns were 7.3%, 9.4% and 7.1% respectively. The median U.S. equity allocation for the F&amp;E universe increased to 19.2% during the quarter.

That's double the $6.99 monthly cost Disney charged for the service when it first launched in 2019.Hulu's ad-free plan will increase by $3 a month, or 20%, to $17.99 a month. The ad-supported tiers for both services will remain at $7.99 each.The price hikes come amid Disney's continued efforts to slash $5.5 billion in costs this year.The monthly prices of its two Hulu live TV packages will also increase by $7 each for both the ad-free plan and the ad-supported offering. ESPN+ will go up by $1 to $10.99 a month.Additionally, Disney announced that starting September 6 subscribers in the US will have access to a new ad-free bundled subscription featuring the ad-free Disney+ and Hulu services for $19.99 a month.Disney reported that streaming losses totaled $512 million in its fiscal third quarter, about half of the $1.1 billion loss reported in the prior-year period and less than the $777 million loss forecast by analysts. The company reported a streaming loss of $659 million in Q2 and a $1.1 billion loss in Q1.Still, the company continues to shed subscribers with the media giant reporting 146.1 million total Disney+ subscribers at the end of the quarter, a 7.4% decline from the previous quarter. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected to see paying users total 154.8 million.The majority of its subscriber losses came from its Indian brand Disney+ Hotstar, which saw users drop by 24% on a sequential basis. Disney said Hotstar is not material to the company due to its lower average revenue per user, or ARPU.

(Star Max/IPx)In addition to the price increases, Disney CEO Bob Iger also said the company will address password sharing — echoing the strategy of competitor Netflix (NFLX), which recently rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to US subscribers in May.""We are actively exploring ways to address account sharing and the best options for paying subscribers to share their accounts with friends and family,"" Iger said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. ""Later this year, we will begin to update our subscriber agreements with additional terms on our sharing policies, and we will roll out tactics to drive monetization sometime in 2024.""Iger said the number of subscribers sharing accounts is ""significant,"" though he wouldn't give a specific number.Disney reported fiscal third quarter results that were mixed, with revenue coming in below estimates while adjusted earnings per share topped Wall Street expectations.These results came after the company revealed its flagship sports network ESPN struck a $2 billion deal with Penn Entertainment (PENN) to launch ESPN Bet, a branded sportsbook.The Disney+ subscriber miss initially caused shares to slide in after-hours trading, but shares rose as much as 3% in extended trade after the company said its full-year 2023 capital expenditures would total $5 billion, below its $6 billion forecast.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

76,4105329b-7148-3e3b-afdb-525c25ece4e4,NFLX,2023-08-10,Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will  produce a Netflix romance movie. See how many millions they’ve raked in from their previous media projects,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meghan-markle-prince-harry-produce-190447712.html,1691607887,STORY,"['NFLX', 'SPOT']","[Prince Harry and Meghan Markle cut most of their ties to the royal family to become Hollywood royals, or at least they’re trying to be.The couple will produce a new Netflix romance based on New York Times bestselling novel Meet Me at the Lake, that has a still unannounced release date. This is their latest project after a series of much-scrutinized productions since stepping down from the royal family in 2020 after becoming disenchanted with royal life.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s media company, Archewell Productions, bought the rights to the novel and will work with streaming giant Netflix to produce a movie adaption, Penguin Random House confirmed on Wednesday.Meet Me at the Lake, written by Carley Fortune, is a love story about a couple, Will and Fern, who meet and fall in love in a whirlwind 24 hours before having to part. The two promise to meet a year later, but when Will seemingly stands Fern up, it’s another 10 years before their paths cross again.Though the story isn’t about being royal, the main characters have many undeniable similarities to Harry and Meghan. For starters, the book is set in Toronto, where Meghan spent seven years filming the television series Suits. It addresses postpartum depression, which Meghan spoke about in a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey. And Will wrestles with the loss of a parent from an automobile accident, a direct parallel to Harry’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who famously died during a paparazzi car chase in 1997.“I’m so thrilled about working with Netflix and Archewell to bring Meet Me at the Lake to the screen,” book author Fortune told Vogue. “Will and Fern’s love story is dear to my heart, and I can’t imagine a more perfect partnership.”The news comes after the couple has faced criticism over recent failed projects and canceled deals.New royals of Hollywood?Harry and Meghan split with the royal family in January 2020, explaining in their six-part Netflix documentary Harry &amp; Meghan that while many factors contributed to their departure, the Palace’s alleged poor treatment of them was the final straw.Story continuesAfter stepping back, Harry and Meghan were cut off from their security detail and royal annual income. In the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, the Sussexes and then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge William and Catherine, now Prince and Princess of Wales, were paid more than £5 million, or over $6 million, from King Charles, then Prince of Wales, according to the BBC. The amount covered the two couples’ public duties and some private expenses.Harry and Meghan now live in Southern California. Their move was largely funded by Harry’s $10 million inheritance from his late mother, according to Forbes. Now the couple makes the bulk of their earnings through their production company, Archewell.Archewell struck a $100 million deal with Netflix in September 2020 to “produce programming that informs, elevates, and inspires,” according to the company’s website. The Harry &amp; Meghan documentary was part of the partnership, as is their upcoming movie Meet Me at the Lake.Archewell also had a $20 million deal with Spotify to produce podcasts. Archetypes, an audio show in which Meghan talked to high-profile stars like tennis player Serena Williams and singer Mariah Carey about the labels and stereotypes they face as women, came from this partnership.Most recently, Harry published his tell-all memoir, Spare, in January, which sold a record-breaking 1.4 million copies on its release day, surpassing former president Barack Obama’s record with his 2020 memoir. Harry was rumored to have received a $20 million advance for the book.All in all, the couple’s movie, television, podcast, and book deals have made them an estimated $135 million, according to Forbes.However, their Netflix and Spotify deals haven’t produced the smash hits they expected.Netflix shot down two of their television show ideas and canceled an animated children’s show called Pearl. People familiar with the matter said that Netflix is unlikely to renew the couple’s deal, which runs through 2025, the Wall Street Journal reported.And in June, Spotify and Archewell ended their podcasting deal after two and a half years. The companies said in a joint statement they had “mutually agreed to part ways.”Sports reporter and Spotify executive Bill Simmons branded Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as “f***ing grifters” after they cut the partnership having only produced 13 episodes.“I wish I had been involved in the ‘Meghan and Harry leave Spotify’ negotiation. ‘The F***ing Grifters.’ That’s the podcast we should have launched with them,” Simmons said on his podcast, The Bill Simmons Podcast, in June. “I have got to get drunk one night and tell the story of the Zoom I had with Harry to try and help him with a podcast idea. It’s one of my best stories… F**k them. The grifters.”Correction, Aug. 9, 2023: An earlier version of this article misstated the role Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will play with their upcoming Netflix film. They will be its producers.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

77,8df6ae1c-94d8-33fe-96d9-294df7e0f871,PSX,2023-08-10,Refiners make hay as global profit margins rebound,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/refiners-hay-global-profit-margins-080404534.html,1691654644,STORY,['PSX'],"[By Mohi Narayan, Laura Sanicola and Ahmad GhaddarNEW DELHI/WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Global refiners are raking in hefty gains, fuelled by a rebound from second-quarter lows in margins on making oil products such as diesel, jet fuel and gasoline, a trend that oil companies and experts expect will continue for the rest of 2023.Recovering profit margins may prompt complex refiners to maximise yields of transport fuels, causing excess naphtha output as a byproduct in a tepid petrochemical market and further depressing feedstock margins.Refiners are optimistic about the bull run due to projected sustained strong demand growth and low inventory levels.""We have lots of pockets of really strong distillate demand in Latin America, up 9%, Asia up 4% and diesel cracks continue to remain strong,"" Brian M. Mandell, executive vice president for marketing &amp; commercial at Phillips 66, said on last week's earnings call.Mandell expects margins to continue to perform well throughout the year heading into higher-demand crop planting season and into winter in the United States.Eugene Lindell, head of refined products at consultancy FGE, said refiners are incentivised to ramp up runs regardless of complexity.""The healthy margins reflect the bull market for diesel combined with still strong gasoline cracks even if gasoline did weaken sharply on week. Chronic weakness in global naphtha cracks is being offset, at least for now, by bullish HSFO (high sulfur fuel oil) cracks, especially in Asia and Europe,"" he said in a note this week.MARGINS SOARProfit on processing a barrel of crude at a typical European or U.S. refinery has jumped by about 33% year to date, while refining profit margins in Asia are up by around 9%, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.A Singapore-based trader said middle distillate cracks, or margins, have traded stronger recently than gasoline, which had hit four-month highs on robust summer demand.Meanwhile, Asian 380-cst HSFO margins posted gains of more than 15% last week, buoyed by Saudi Arabia's announcement of further crude supply cuts.Story continues""Middle distillates are expected to continue outplaying gasoline and so will remain the margin driver (in the second half), even after cracks shed over $10 per barrel from current levels in Asia,"" FGE's Lindell told Reuters.However, Lindell said fourth-quarter margins could be substantially weaker than present levels though they will remain healthier than 2020 and 2021, as naphtha margins are not likely to improve over the next six months at least, while gasoline is seen weakening once refiners shift towards making cheaper winter grades of the fuel.OUTAGES, INVENTORIESFor now, unplanned refinery outages in Asia and elsewhere are also supporting margins.According to FGE estimates, about 250,000 barrels per day of capacity was offline in Asia in the last two months, including in Malaysia at Petronas' PIC refinery, at Hyundai Oilbank's Daesan refinery in South Korea and at Japan's ENEOS.Next month, planned maintenance at India's Reliance Industries, BPCL and Indian Oil will bring a combined 430,000 bpd of capacity offline, FGE estimated.U.S. oil companies said during recent second quarter earnings presentations that strong global demand for fuels and low product inventories are driving robust profits.Gasoline inventories are 7% below five-year averages while distillate inventories are 19% below averages, Mandell of Phillips 66 said.FGE analysts expect middle distillate stocks to start drawing down as OPEC+ cuts supplies of medium sour crudes, which are ideal for diesel.Meanwhile, global refining capacity additions lagged expectations, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 executives said.""Despite crack spreads incentivising high refining utilisation, product inventory levels remain low,"" Michael J. Hennigan, president, CEO &amp; director of Marathon, said on last week's earnings call.""Global capacity additions continue to progress slower than anticipated, and we believe that global demand growth will remain strong,"" Hennigan added.(Reporting by Mohi Narayan in New Delhi, Laura Sanicola in Washington and Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Additional reporting by Jeslyn Lerh in Singapore; Editing by Tony Munroe and Muralikumar Anantharaman)]"
78,4a55739b-f7f0-39cc-9b16-7e15d7f511c7,PSX,2023-08-10,Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Phillips 66's (NYSE:PSX) Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robust-financials-driving-recent-rally-132217867.html,1691587337,STORY,['PSX'],"[Phillips 66's (NYSE:PSX) stock is up by a considerable 21% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Phillips 66's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Phillips 66 is:37% = US$11b ÷ US$31b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.37 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Phillips 66's Earnings Growth And 37% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Phillips 66 has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 28% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Phillips 66's moderate 17% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Phillips 66's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 26% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Phillips 66's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Phillips 66 Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?In Phillips 66's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 15% (or a retention ratio of 85%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Additionally, Phillips 66 has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 41% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 16% over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Phillips 66's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Operating income of the segment totaled $2.3 billion, below our projection of $2.8 billion.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $36.8 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31 billion but declined 32.1% year over year.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteInside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $2.3 billion, which plunged from the year-ago profit of $7.1 billion. The decline primarily reflects lower year-over-year margins and refined product sales to go with a decrease in capacity utilization.Specifically, the refining margin of $22.10 per barrel compared to $37.54 a year ago though it came ahead of our estimate of $17.98. Capacity utilization during the quarter was 93%, down from 100% in the corresponding period of 2022. We expected the metric to be 91.3%. The year-over-year tick-down reflects planned maintenance activity in the Mid-Continent and West Coast regions.Meanwhile, total refined product sales volumes were 3,581 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), down from 3,615 mbpd in the year-ago quarter and our estimate of 3,630.2 mbpd. Throughput also fell from 3,069 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,925 mbpd but outperformed our estimate of 2,860 mbpd.MPC’s operating costs per barrel edged down from $5.19 in the year-ago quarter to $5.15. The company managed to reign in expenses due to lower energy outgo and disciplined execution. Our estimates factored in a higher unit cost of $5.20.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP MPLX — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, up 6.7% from the second quarter of 2022. Earnings were supported by higher tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Story continues Financial AnalysisMarathon Petroleum, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported expenses of $33.5 billion in second-quarter 2023, falling 27% from the year-ago quarter but coming above our projection of $24.5 billion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $562 million on capital programs (43% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 48% on the Midstream segment) compared to $577 million in the year-ago period. As of Jun 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $7.3 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $27.3 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 46.3%.In the second quarter, MPC repurchased $3.1 billion of shares and a further $800 million worth of shares in July. The company currently has a remaining authorization of $6.3 billion.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MPC’s second-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.87, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.54. The outperformance can be primarily attributed to lower expenses. The positives were partially offset by PSX’s declining refining margins worldwide.For the reported quarter, Phillips 66 generated $955 million of net cash from operations, down from $1.8 billion a year ago. PSX’s capital expenditure and investments totaled $551 million. It paid out dividends of $474 million in the reported quarter. As of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $3 billion. Meanwhile, Phillips 66 reported total debt of $19.9 billion, reflecting a consolidated debt to capitalization of 39%.Another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, also reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. The EPS of $5.40 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.08. This was on account of VLO’s increased renewable diesel sales volumes and a decline in total costs of sales.At the end of the second quarter, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.3 billion. Valero’s second-quarter capital investment was $458 million.

TJX, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, Five Below, Inc. FIVE and Costco Wholesale Corp. COST.Industry: Retail - WholesaleLink: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2134359/4-retail-stocks-with-high-probability-to-beat-on-earningsAs we find ourselves at the peak of the earnings season, a significant portion of releases from the Retail-Wholesale sector still awaits. This reporting cycle, a glimpse into the sector's performance reveals a likely modest acceleration in both sales and earnings. The outcomes are poised to be shaped by prevailing consumer sentiments, spending trends and the pressing challenge of rising input costs.Factors at PlayUndeniably, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown signs of slowing down. Several factors have come into play, including underlying inflationary pressure, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings.We note that U.S. retail sales experienced a slight increase in June 2023, albeit falling short of analysts' predictions. Retail sales showed 0.2% growth, marking a deceleration from the 0.5% growth recorded in May. Nonetheless, this upturn in sales serves as a testament to the resilience demonstrated by consumers. Furthermore, continued wage gains, coupled with the abatement of inflationary pressures from the peak, have provided much-needed impetus to the retail industry.No doubt, inflation has been a subject of concern across various sectors, including retail. Rising cost pressures, the tight labor market and higher promotional activities have put margins in the spotlight. This has spurred retailers into action, re-engaging with their customer base, recalibrating pricing strategies, refreshing product assortments and identifying opportunities to curtail costs.Story continuesAlso, companies have been undertaking a more consumer-centric approach — emphasizing membership programs, upgrading store technology, shopping via the mobile app and last-mile delivery solutions. Expedited delivery services like doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store, as well as contactless payment solutions, have been aiding in maximizing the share of customers’ wallets.Per the latest Zacks Earnings Preview, the sector is anticipated to have witnessed top-line growth of 4.1% year over year in the second quarter of 2023. This follows a 5.5% increase in the preceding season. Meanwhile, the bottom line is expected to have increased 6.1% this earnings season. The sector registered earnings growth of 2.9% in the previous reporting cycle.Making the Perfect ChoiceWith the earnings season in full swing, it is worthwhile to invest in companies with earnings beat potential.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 16, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.1%.Revenues are expected to be $12.4 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TJX?For TJX, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.63%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that TJX will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TJX would post earnings of $0.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering a surprise of +7.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TJX appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

83,484fe8d6-c6e5-3c9d-907a-a458343007dd,TJX,2023-08-10,4 Retail Stocks With High Probability to Beat on Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-retail-stocks-high-probability-143100414.html,1691591460,STORY,"['COST', 'TJX', 'URBN']","[As we find ourselves at the peak of the earnings season, a significant portion of releases from the Retail-Wholesale sector still awaits. This reporting cycle, a glimpse into the sector's performance reveals a likely modest acceleration in both sales and earnings. The outcomes are poised to be shaped by prevailing consumer sentiments, spending trends and the pressing challenge of rising input costs.Factors at PlayUndeniably, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown signs of slowing down. Several factors have come into play, including underlying inflationary pressure, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings.We note that U.S. retail sales experienced a slight increase in June 2023, albeit falling short of analysts' predictions. Retail sales showed 0.2% growth, marking a deceleration from the 0.5% growth recorded in May. Nonetheless, this upturn in sales serves as a testament to the resilience demonstrated by consumers. Furthermore, continued wage gains, coupled with the abatement of inflationary pressures from the peak, have provided much-needed impetus to the retail industry.No doubt, inflation has been a subject of concern across various sectors, including retail. Rising cost pressures, the tight labor market and higher promotional activities have put margins in the spotlight. This has spurred retailers into action, re-engaging with their customer base, recalibrating pricing strategies, refreshing product assortments and identifying opportunities to curtail costs.Also, companies have been undertaking a more consumer-centric approach — emphasizing membership programs, upgrading store technology, shopping via the mobile app and last-mile delivery solutions. Expedited delivery services like doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store, as well as contactless payment solutions, have been aiding in maximizing the share of customers’ wallets.Per the latest Zacks Earnings Preview, the sector is anticipated to have witnessed top-line growth of 4.1% year over year in the second quarter of 2023. This follows a 5.5% increase in the preceding season. Meanwhile, the bottom line is expected to have increased 6.1% this earnings season. The sector registered earnings growth of 2.9% in the previous reporting cycle.Story continuesMaking the Perfect ChoiceWith the earnings season in full swing, it is worthwhile to invest in companies with earnings beat potential. A stock generally rallies on an earnings beat.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We have identified four stocks — The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, Five Below, Inc. FIVE, and Costco Wholesale Corporation COST — that are poised to trump earnings estimates this season.4 Prominent PicksThe TJX Companies, with a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.63%, is worth betting on. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings per share has been stable at 76 cents, suggesting an increase of 10.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding this Issaquah, WA-based company in registering decent sales numbers.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) share price is up 33% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Meanwhile, the last twelve months saw the share price rise 2.9%.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Amgen In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 35% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 6% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Amgen will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Amgen's TSR for the last 5 years was 54%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmgen shareholders have received returns of 6.3% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the general market return. We should note here that the five-year TSR is more impressive, at 9% per year. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes Amgen a stock worth watching. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

87,361eb2ad-2053-4e52-89fd-d4c8fceee366,M,2023-08-10,"Gas prices are higher again, hitting consumers 'very directly and very profoundly'",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gas-prices-are-higher-again-hitting-consumers-very-directly-and-very-profoundly-142018507.html,1691590818,STORY,"['NKE', 'M', 'KSS', 'LULU', 'GPS', 'URBN']","[Gas prices are just plain high, and consumers are taking notice.As of Wednesday, the national average gas price stands at $3.83 per gallon, per AAA. That's lower than the average price this time last year, at $4.06, but slightly higher than last week's average price at $3.78.And that may have larger implications on consumer spending and how Americans feel about the economy, especially heading into the important back-to-school shopping season.""[Consumer] sentiment is very directly and very profoundly affected by gas prices,"" Michael Zdinak, economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance (see chart below). He added that there's a roughly 70% correlation between gas prices and sentiment over the time period shown below.One reason for that is consumers see gas prices and food prices move in real-time, he said.According to eToro global market strategist Ben Laidler, the move in gas prices from $3.09 in December 2022 to the national average price on Monday at $3.83 is an extra annual cost of roughly $101 billion for US consumers in total (based on the estimate that Americans use roughly 375 million gallons of gas each day).With where gas prices stand — and they should remain elevated — that means consumers have less money to spend elsewhere, such as discretionary purchases.'Sour outlook' for retailers?Higher gas prices, in addition to a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments this fall, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, higher cost of groceries, and a potential rise in the CPI reading due out this Thursday could form a perfect storm for US consumers — and change the way they shop.If American consumers' fears about the economy start to happen, incomes will take a hit, Zdinak said, which in turn could ""sour our outlook for spending.""Yet ""consumers have been shockingly resilient"" following a pandemic, ongoing war overseas, and a bank crisis earlier this year, he added — so it will take a lot to change the narrative this year.Story continuesSome of these themes are playing out in the back-to-school shopping season already underway.A Deloitte survey found that 68% of US parents expect to spend the same or less on back-to-school compared to last year. More than half (51%) said inflation is to blame for less disposable income while 75% said they plan to spend less because of higher prices.Although spending habits for the back-to-school season won't be reflected in next week's quarterly retail earnings results, Morningstar senior analyst David Swartz noted that ""expectations are not high, partly because of the gas prices and student loan payments but mostly because spending on apparel has cooled off since a very strong year in 2021.""""Retailers that cater to wealthier shoppers, such as Lululemon or Anthropologie, may be doing better than ones that sell to lower-income consumers, like Kohl’s or Urban Outfitters,"" said Swartz, who covers retailers such as Macy's (M), Nike (NKE), and Gap (GPS).A person pumps gas at a Shell gas station on August 03, 2023, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell via Getty Images)Excess savings to be depleted by the end of the year, per BNP ParibasThere's another factor that could affect consumers' ability to ride out higher gas prices: diminishing savings.""All this savings accumulated from the pandemic,"" BNP Paribas senior US economist Andy Schneider told Yahoo Finance. ""That was a real tailwind last year while the real wage story was a headwind, so ... now they've really flipped.""According to Schneider, those excess savings allowed consumers to ""shrug off"" headwinds such as higher inflation and high gas prices.But now, ""excess savings is becoming more of a headwind,"" he added. ""It's running down and we think that should be more or less depleted by the end of the year.""All this means less extra cash for consumers to sit on.""I think it's just a new era,"" Schneider said, adding: ""Now people are going to have to broach something like higher gas prices without being able to rely on a higher stock of savings that they had last year, and this year they don't.""Still, there may be some good news for Americans: Outside of a major shock to oil prices, the worst may be behind us when it comes to higher prices at the pump.""Barring a hurricane or OPEC production cut, we may have seen our peak and may see slight declines (not major),"" Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis, told Yahoo Finance. ""But with a lot impacting the market from economic data, etc, we're one surprise away from seeing gas prices going right back up.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Who would have thought just 6 months ago that we would be run rating $2.2 billion of property EBITDA? To put that in context, peak annual property EBITDA for the company was $2 billion in 2018. Yet here we are today. We have a more diversified business with the addition of Encore Boston Harbor. We have a business in Macau that is running structurally higher margins into a resurging market, a business in Las Vegas that is more relevant than ever and is producing nearly double its 2018 EBITDA on much higher margins, and we have a very substantial growth opportunity in the UAE, the most exciting new gaming market in decades.I see tremendous value in our business, and I know our brightest days are ahead of us. Our path is the clearest it has been in years, and our team is committed and energized.Turning to the quarter and starting in Vegas, Wynn Las Vegas delivered $224 million of adjusted property EBITDA. On a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA was up 3% on a very difficult year-over-year comp. We saw strength all over the place: the casino, the hotel, the restaurants, retail, you name it, all supported by a consumer that seems more than willing to continue spending on unique luxury experiences. Now we obviously have a very particular customer type skewing heavily to luxury, and we continue to closely monitor whether or not interest rates and inflation begin to impact that consumer. But so far, so good. In fact, drop, handle and REVPAR are all up year-over-year in July. And that's obviously before we get into the latter portion of the year, which has a number of tailwinds from citywide programming.Turning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $69 million of EBITDAR, an all-time property record. We generated record GGR in the casino, led by strong growth in slot handle and the addition of retail sports betting earlier this year. On the non-gaming side, we delivered strong hotel revenue, driven by both ADR and occupancy. On the development front in Boston, we're advancing our East of Broadway expansion project now.Turning to Macau. We generated $246 million of EBITDA in the quarter, which was 72% of pre-COVID levels. Hold was a bit of a mixed bag in the quarter as we held high in our VIP business, but that was more than offset by low hold on the mass table side. We saw strength across the property with several components of the business above 2019 levels. In the casino, mass table drop increased 4% versus Q2 2019, despite the fact that portions of Wynn Macau's casino were closed for renovation during the quarter. The quality of our product and service, the relaunch of our loyalty program and our very robust non-gaming events calendar all helped drive 14.2% market share in the quarter, consistent with our share as we exited 2019.On the non-gaming side, our retail business continues to be incredibly strong, with tenant retail sales increasing 47% relative to 2Q 2019. Looking forward, as you have seen, market-wide GGR momentum in Macau has been impressive, building through the second quarter. The strength has continued into Q3, with mass drop per day in July exceeding what we experienced in each month in Q2 and reaching 120% of daily mass drop in 2019. In July, we also continued to experience robust hotel occupancy and very healthy tenant retail sales. On the development front, we are deep into design and planning for our concession-related CapEx commitments, which we believe will help support Macau's long-term diversification goals and be additive to our business over the coming years.Lastly, construction is now underway on Wynn Al Marjan Island, our planned integrated resort in the UAE, with our secant walls and soil compaction complete and over 40% of the required hotel piles in the ground. As I said earlier, this is the most exciting new market opening in decades, and we will bring our A game to this development. Our 40% equity ownership and management license fees will drive a very healthy ROI for Wynn Resorts shareholders. With that, I will now turn it back to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?Story continuesJulie Mireille Cameron-DoeThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $224.1 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $578.1 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.8%. Slightly lower than normal hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $2 million in Q2, and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year. Our hotel revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $177.8 million, a new second quarter record, on the back of an increase of 24,000 occupied room nights due to rooms that were out of service for renovations in Q2 2022. ADR occupancy and RevPAR were all up slightly compared to Q2 2022, despite the increase in available room nights, highlighting the appeal of our newly renovated room product. Our other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage, entertainment and retail. In the casino, our GGR increased around 2% year-over-year, driven by a 14.8% year-over-year increase in slot handle and table drops that was roughly flat.Turning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $69.1 million, an all-time property record. EBITDA margin was 31.1%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength across casino and nongaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $193 million of GGR, a property record, with strength in both tables and slots. Our nongaming revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year to $55.1 million, with particular strength in hotel and food and beverage. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side, with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day, of approximately $1.15 million in Q2 2023, up 3.6% year-over-year on increased business volumes and down 1% sequentially.As you may have seen in the press, we were pleased to recently sign new union agreements that provide our employees with competitive wages, benefits and a best-in-class working environment that reflects our Wynn service standards. We expect the incremental OpEx from the new agreements to be partially offset by cost efficiencies we have identified in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience. Additionally, I would like to note that business volumes in Q3 are temporarily being negatively impacted by the Sumner Tunnel restoration project the City of Boston is conducting that will be ongoing through August 31. The impact is primarily being felt in our table games business, as both slots and nongaming revenue continued to grow year-on-year in July.Our Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $246.2 million in the quarter on $769.9 million of operating revenue. As Craig noted, we held high in our VIP business, but this was more than offset by lower-than-expected hold on the mass table side. We were encouraged by the meaningful uptick in visitation and demand we experienced during the quarter, with particular strength in mass casino drop, direct VIP turnover, luxury retail sales and hotel revenue all above Q2 2019 levels. EBITDA margin was 32% in the quarter, an increase of 280 basis points relative to Q2 2019, with Wynn Palace's margin reaching 33.4%, or 690 basis points above Q2 2019 levels.EBITDA margin strength was driven by a combination of a favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies. In fact, our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.2 million per day in Q2, a decrease of 29% compared to $3.2 million in Q2 2019 and down 2% from Q1 despite the meaningful sequential increase in business volumes. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs, and we're well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.In terms of CapEx, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitment. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very near term. As such, for 2023 through 2024, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $300 million and $400 million.Turning to Wynn Interactive, our EBITDA burn rate decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $15 million in Q2 2023. Our team continues to stay disciplined on costs while driving improved marketing efficiencies.Moving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.7 billion as of June 30. This was comprised of $1.8 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $2.9 billion in the U.S. Importantly, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties run rating approximately $2.2 billion of annualized property EBITDA, together with our robust cash and liquidity, creates a very healthy leverage profile for the company globally.We're also pleased to announce that the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on August 31, 2023, to stockholders of record as of August 21, 2023, highlighting our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $92 million, primarily related to the (inaudible) renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas and normal course maintenance across the business. With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.Carlo SantarelliHey Craig, Julie, everyone. So Craig, just on the Macau front, obviously, the reduction sequentially in daily OpEx was a little bit of a differentiator relative to what we've seen in some peer reports. Can you talk a little bit more about that? And also, it looks as though your implied commission discounts, et cetera, were -- as a percentage of revenue were down nicely sequentially. Do you expect kind of that trend to continue going forward?Craig Scott BillingsSure, Carlo. Well, first, on the OpEx side, I think that we're always modulating OpEx based on business volumes and what we need to get done in any particular quarter. I think the distinction between us and perhaps some of the other folks that have reported that you have seen is that we opened with a full complement of folks. And so we weren't dragging floors, we didn't have rooms out of service, et cetera, et cetera. And so we came out of the gate with the full OpEx that you're seeing today, and any movements between quarters is really going to be a function of the business in that quarter.On the commissions and discounts, there hasn't been any substantial change to how we do that. So again, that's going to be quite player-specific, based on the parameters of each player. And so again, I wouldn't read too much into it.Carlo SantarelliGreat. And then if I could, Craig, a follow-up. Turning to Las Vegas, obviously, very strong performance on the -- especially on the cost discipline side. Can you talk a little bit -- I believe your labor contract actually ended in July. So I wouldn't have expected any impact, but could you talk a little bit about how you guys intend to kind of accrue for what may be a settlement and some new terms going forward or anything that was present in the 2Q, perhaps?Craig Scott BillingsSure. How much time have you got, Carlos?Carlo SantarelliPlenty. Plenty, I guess.Craig Scott BillingsWell, first, what I'll say is this. First and foremost, the team at Wynn Las Vegas is the heart and soul of the place. They're very important to me, and it's the same reason that we paid everybody during the closure, during COVID. And if you look over the term of the last union contracts, their contractual wage increases initially outpaced inflation. And then, of course, lagged inflation over the course of the past couple of years. Net-net, over the last contract, they were actually flat versus core CPI.But unfortunately, and it's a reality, rent in Las Vegas has increased more than CPI over that same period. And it's very important to me that our employees can support a stable home environment for their families. So I expect there will be some back and forth as we work with culinary to find a fair compensation level that supports our folks, particularly our non-tipped folks, and their ability to maintain their housing. It's pretty early in the process. So we're not really even close to quantifying dollars yet or talking about accruals. But rest assured, we'll figure it out in a way that's positive for the business over the medium and long term.OperatorAnd our next caller is Joe Greff with JPMorgan.Joseph Richard GreffCraig, when you look back at the 2Q, would you say in Macau -- would you say when Macau and the Peninsula was -- had a meaningful amount of renovation disruption to the EBITDA line that you would call out? Or do you think you were able to effectively shift what otherwise have been disrupted to either other parts of the casino or to your property in Cotai?Craig Scott BillingsWell, the renovation -- thanks, Joe. The renovations that took place were smack dab in the middle of the casino floor. So certainly, there was a level of disruption. I think the more macro point would be that a lot of the visitation that has come back, particularly for us, has come back in Cotai. And we've -- if you think about a world where there are no longer any junkets, yet we're holding market share. I'm incredibly proud of what we've been able to do on a combined basis.But certainly, we have work to do in terms of share downtown. And the business will go as that share goes. It's a pretty simple business. Your market share times the market, minus taxes, minus OpEx equals EBITDA. So our focus is on driving share downtown, and really, that's the way that we think about the business going forward. And that's why we did the renovations in the first place. So I don't want to give you the impression that the quarter's results were entirely a function of the renovation, because they're not. But certainly, on the margin, they were impacted.Joseph Richard GreffAnd I'm presuming the renovation was completed at some point in June, if you can confirm that. But would you expect that Cotai and Peninsula would be more in balance going forward, similar to 2019? Or do you think visitation dynamics are such where the Cotai region is just going to get a little bit more traction?Craig Scott BillingsConfirmed and the latter.Joseph Richard GreffGot it. Okay. And then you called out -- as others did in the 1Q and parts of the 2Q this reporting season, talking about low hold on the mass side, we can see the whole percentages in the last couple of quarters versus what you did in 2019 at both properties. What is that a function of? Are players betting side bets or playing differently? Or is it really just a couple of quarters of aberrations and expected table hold percentages?Craig Scott BillingsYes. You're right. And historically, by the way, we haven't normalized for mass hold, and that was -- that made sense when the business was more balanced between mass and VIP. So that's something we're going to rethink going forward. But to your question very specifically, it's really a function of 2 things. And it was most acute at Wynn Macau rather than Wynn Palace. It's a function of volumes and normal course volatility.So you mentioned just normal aberrations, and certainly, that's part of it. But volume inherently smooths volatility. So when you had tour groups and you had core mass and you had just more bodies coming to Macau, the impact of volatility was inherently muted, and that's just not the case right now. So I would expect to continue to see volatility. Sometimes it will be to our benefit, and sometimes it will be to the players.OperatorOur next caller is Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.Shaun Clisby KelleyCraig, maybe one more about Macau. But just wondering if you could give a little bit of color about sort of segments of business, what you're seeing across particularly behavior-wise across premium mass and VIP. And I'm really thinking kind of spend per visit relative to what's left to recover on the visitation side as you look to see things normalize?Craig Scott BillingsYes. I'm going to not comment on VIP, because it's obviously very patron-specific, and VIP volumes are, while surprisingly good, still a fraction of what they were previously. On the mass side, we've seen length of stay decline, which makes sense because during COVID, if you made the commitment to come, you were coming for an extended period. But we've seen spend per customer actually go up. And so frequency has increased, length of stay has decreased and spend per customer has gone up, which is great, because that gives you the opportunity to make efficient use of your rooms and is generally good for business. But I don't really have a comment on VIP.Shaun Clisby KelleyVery helpful. And then maybe one for you or Julie, I just wanted to ask about the CapEx comment in the prepared remarks. I believe the callout was around some of the concession commitments and something around $300 million to $400 million. The question is, was that a per year number? Or is that a total number across kind of 2023 and 2024? And then if you could just remind us how you're thinking about sort of the CapEx versus possible OpEx components related to that concession process? Because I know it's a little different for everybody, and I know these plans are moving around some.Julie Mireille Cameron-DoeSure. I'll take that. Yes, that number we've given out of $300 million to $400 million is the '23 to '24 number. And really, we've done that. I think we've always foreshadowed that the process takes some time because of all the different approvals that are required. So we were hopeful that we would get more on this year. But actually, now we're looking at the $300 million to $400 million over the '23 to '24 period in total.In terms of how we're thinking about the concession, it's more than half of the commitment we made. More than half of the $2 billion is CapEx-related, and we do expect that to be front-end loaded. So obviously, with the $300 million to $400 million in the first 2 years, and then a similar clip to that for a couple of years after that.Craig Scott BillingsAnd then I would just point out that on the OpEx side, I would just like to remind you that there's a lot of things that we do in the business today that already support nongaming. And so we don't expect all of that to be incremental.OperatorOur next caller is Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley.Stephen White GramblingMaybe a clarification on July in Macau. I think you said the run rate was 120% of 2019 levels on hold. Should we think of that as true for hold adjusted win rate comparing versus 2019? And any reason to believe that the $2.2 million in OpEx per day would be similar or different during that month versus the quarter as we build going forward?Craig Scott BillingsThe 120 -- sure. The 120% that I referenced was drop. So it has no -- so Wynn obviously has no impact. And OpEx, no expectation of any material changes in OpEx.Stephen White GramblingAnd then maybe as a follow-up on capital allocation. I think if we take the $2.2 billion run rate EBITDAR, less the concession spend, some other CapEx in Vegas in the dividend. It looks like there could still be some free cash flow left over. Is that the right way to think about it? And is there appetite in our ability to ramp capital return? Or do you generally think the pandemic has altered how you think about liquidity and leverage?Craig Scott BillingsJulie, do you want to take the first portion of that, and I'll take the second?Julie Mireille Cameron-DoeAbout the CapEx?Craig Scott BillingsAbout the free cash flow.Julie Mireille Cameron-DoeSure. Yes, you're quite right. We're now with the $2.2 billion run rate and interest under control and all of that, we have sizable discretionary free cash flow. And so we're very focused on what we'll be doing in terms of delevering, returning to shareholders and of course, all of the exciting projects we have in front of us.Craig Scott BillingsYes. We're well capitalized at the moment. And I expect we will maintain some extra liquidity until we really see how a few things play out. First is New York. The second is the macro economy and the third is the yield curve. And we're always looking at the markets, the capital markets and thinking about when to refinance and whether to do it dollar-for-dollar or modestly delever. And when to return capital to shareholders, primarily by adding to the dividend. So we're in a bit of a wait-and-see approach at this moment. But if you think about it, we've got a great project in the UAE that is going to be a stunner. We've reinitiated our dividend, and our leverage is well under control. So we feel pretty good about where we are.OperatorOur next caller comes from David Katz with Jefferies.David Brian KatzI'm hoping for just a little more insight on margins in Macau. It's been one of the questions that -- trying to figure out what the new normal is or could be longer term as we think about the future, largely driven by revenue mix. I wonder what updated thoughts you may have versus what we would have had 90 days ago. Or more than that when I was over to visit, where it was the prevailing question.Craig Scott BillingsSure, David. Not really. I mean, I think a little bit like what happened in the U.S., we learned to run our business differently. So you mentioned primarily related to business mix. And certainly, that's a component of it. But we're running the business really, really well. The quality of service is as it should be and as it has always been, yet our OpEx has come down pretty meaningfully. And I think it's a testament to Linda and Frederic and Craig (inaudible), our CFO, over there and everything they've been able to do with the business. So really, what you're seeing is particularly at Palace, you can see it in the margin. What you're seeing is the impact of both sides of it with operating leverage coming through from business volumes and pretty robust expense control.David Brian KatzRight. And leaving it to us to decide on the order of magnitude, but it is fair to assume that there still should be some margin upside in Macau still to be captured as volumes return, correct?Craig Scott BillingsWell, I haven't been in an Excel model in probably 15 years. But if I were doing one, I would probably hold margin at Palace relatively constant, just to be conservative. I mean, it's in the low-30s today, which is pretty darn good. And I would assume that Wynn Macau's margin increases as we aggressively fight for share.OperatorOur next caller is Brandt Montour with Barclays.Brandt Antoine MontourSo in Las Vegas, obviously, a great result there. REVPAR and ADR were flat to up small year-over-year. Just curious, how you're feeling about taking rate from these levels that you're at. Today, obviously, occupancy is pretty full. And looking out in the back half of the year, how do you feel about your comparisons -- sort of cadence, third quarter, fourth quarter, as well as the sort of financial impact or the hotel impact from F1 in the fourth quarter?Craig Scott BillingsSure. I'll start, and then I'll ask Brian to comment. We have grown ADR pretty meaningfully, certainly since the property reopened from the closure in 2020, and I'm incredibly proud of our ability to do that. It really speaks to the product that we offer. And we've held those rates, and we've continued to have a rate premium to the rest of the town. Our ability to continue to take rate really depends on the macro.And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the best I can do is kind of give you a clear picture of what we're seeing right now, and it's good. But as I've said before, we have a 2023 playbook for really end 2024 for every scenario. So I'm not really going to forecast whether we think we can continue to take rate given how dependent it is on the overall economy, but we're feeling great about our business. Brian, do you want to talk about pacing?Brian GullbrantsSure. Yes. I mean if you look at -- our forward-looking demand indicators are really remaining quite healthy. The room bookings we have are pacing up year-over-year. And as far as group pace, it continues to be strong. We've mentioned it on previous calls, Q3 and Q4 continue with the same pace that we've had thus far this year. So 2023 will wind up being a record group year. And '24 continues to pace ahead of that. So we keep looking for the signs, but lead volume is there, and our team does a great job of converting.Brandt Antoine MontourOkay. That's super helpful. And then for Al Marjan, I appreciate the comments. Obviously, an exciting property. Can you give us an update on the casino license and sort of the pathway there and just an update, if you have everything you need for the sort of full plan that you've laid out in your initial projections?Craig Scott BillingsSure. We have everything we need to operate gaming in Al Marjan. And I think there's confusion here because there's a lack of understanding regarding individual Emirates versus the UAE as a whole. It's clearly a 10, as I think I've talked about before to a state and federal system. So while there may be conversation in other Emirates about legalization or legalization at the federal level, thereby covering all Emirates, I expect that we will have our license for Ras Al Khaimah actually imminently. But there should be no concern that there is a legalization process that needs to occur in order for a broader legalization process in order for gaming to occur in that property.OperatorThank you. Our next caller is Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.Daniel Brian PolitzerOn prior calls, I think you mentioned that you could get back to a run rate EBITDA -- and I think it was about $26 billion, $27 billion range for GGR. I mean given what you're seeing in terms of mix and margin, is that still achievable? And going back to that July under 20% data point that you gave, is this something that maybe is achievable in the back end of this year?Craig Scott BillingsI mean it depends on the market. Again, the model there is, as I said, pretty straightforward. Your share times the market, minus taxes, minus OpEx. So it really depends on which way the market goes. The market estimate where we think we would get back remains, as you described, probably closer to 27 versus 26, based on the share we turned in this particular quarter, but generally, that holds true.Daniel Brian PolitzerGot it. And then just for my follow-up. In terms of Wynn Macau, you mentioned you're going to be fighting for share there. Is that -- is it fair to say that margins maybe come down a little bit from these current levels? And I guess more broadly, as it relates to premium mass, are you seeing an uptick in promotions within that segment?Craig Scott BillingsOn the second question, no, the market has been pretty disciplined, and we're certainly pleased with that. On the first question, I don't think you should expect margin to go down at Wynn Macau. If the subtext of your question was will we need to get promotional in order to drive business to Wynn Macau, no, you should not assume that the margin will go down because we have tremendous operating leverage that comes with each 10 basis points of share at that property.OperatorOur next caller is Chad Beynon with Macquarie.Chad C. BeynonI wanted to ask about the Interactive cash burn. You mentioned that that's come down again year-over-year and sequentially. Are you still on track for this to turn profitable in the fourth quarter? And any other kind of insights in terms of where this is going and how the flow-through should look if revenues rise from here during peak season?Craig Scott BillingsSure. I don't think we ever said it would be breakeven in the fourth quarter. But what we are focused on is making sure that it goes down every quarter.Julie Mireille Cameron-DoeYes. Just -- I mean the sports betting's a tough business. It's about the game of commodity. They're difficult businesses, but we're very focused on managing this business. We've got a very long-term shareholder-friendly view on it. So that's our focus.Chad C. BeynonAnd then another one on Macau. You just mentioned the $27 billion GGR number. We did see some sequential growth in the last recent month. But I'm just wondering, as some of the farther out visitors come back to the market, I guess we'd kind of have to look through the database figuring out where all the premium players are in all of China. But does this matter as much for you guys? Or are there enough people in kind of Hong Kong and Guangdong for you to continue to put up numbers? Or do you really need some of those further out markets to open up from a visa and just a visitation standpoint? And are they driving higher spend per trip than what you're seeing in the property right now?Craig Scott BillingsEvery customer matters, Chad. It's -- of course, we want to see the underlying regions start to contribute to Macau. Are we dependent on it? No. But certainly, that's going to add incremental heft to the recovery, and that's going to add incremental heft to the total market, which again pushes us further back towards breakeven. Sorry, breakeven with 2019 or equal to 2019.OperatorAnd our next caller is John DeCree with CBRE.John G. DeCreeMaybe just a 2-part question on Las Vegas. Craig, to the extent you can provide maybe a little bit more color around the visibility you have for the big events like F1 or Super Bowl. And then maybe the second part of that question is when you look at your forward demand indicators for bookings, is -- how much of that kind of year-on-year growth is tethered to those events? And excluding those events, are you still seeing good booking indicators for those maybe less peak periods or less kind of event-driven periods?Craig Scott BillingsSure. I'll start, and then I'll ask Brian to comment. So Brian's prior comment on booking pace was independent of those events, to answer your -- to answer your last question. F1, Super Bowl, I mean, these are events that are made for us, right? Because we end up picking up the top end of the patrons and customers that come to town for those events. And so we're really excited about it, about where we are and where we sit. Brian, do you want to provide some more color?Brian GullbrantsSure. Yes, I think both of these events, specifically F1 and then Super Bowl, definitely played to the strengths of our brand. It's a perfect match. We are getting significant premiums for those 2 events themselves. And I think we're pacing quite nicely. I know some of our competitors have given more specific data, but I can tell you we're going to do just fine here.Julie Mireille Cameron-DoeThanks, John. And operator, the next question will be our last.OperatorThank you. And our final question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.Robin Margaret FarleyGreat. Thank you for letting me sneak in here at the end. Can you clarify just to sort of make it comparable to previous periods, what the VIP hold added to make EBITDA in Macau?Craig Scott BillingsJulIe? Holding back to VIP.Julie Mireille Cameron-DoeHolding back to VIP. I mean as we said on the call, we held a little bit high on VIP, but that was more than offset by lower mass hold. So we're not actually getting into breaking it out.Robin Margaret FarleyOkay. And then...Craig Scott BillingsIt was about $20 million. So we have $20 million of high hold on VIP. This is what I was alluding to earlier. We need to -- we're going to start normalizing for mass hold, because so much of our business now is mass. But it's about $20 million in Macau, and low mass hold more than offset that, as Julie said.Robin Margaret FarleyOkay. Great. And I appreciate you breaking that out just to make it kind of comparable to previous quarters. So -- and then -- and I'm sorry if I missed your comment on this, but have you talked about how much of the margin do you think you can hold on to in Vegas?Craig Scott BillingsWell, in the midst of -- in the midst of the dark days of COVID, we put out a permanent cost savings figure, and we've held to that. We certainly, again, learned to run our business differently during COVID. And what I would say is that our business volumes over the course of the past 1.5 years have been absolutely off the charts, and we've held the line and still held true to the brand. So the business kind of is the business now. To the extent that there is a macro -- any macro-driven change to our business volumes or to our ADRs, et cetera, we have a playbook for that because we just lived it as we went through COVID, and we'll be ready. Again, we're not seeing that. But we're certainly ready for every scenario.Julie Mireille Cameron-DoeWell, thank you, operator. With that, that concludes the Q2 earnings call. Thanks, everybody, for your attention. We look forward to talking to you again soon.OperatorThank you for participating on today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

Sonos (SONO) shares surged in extended trading as the company's third quarter results beat estimates on both adjusted earnings and revenue. Disney (DIS) shares are trading lower in after-hours as the company's third quarter earnings report showed revenue and subscriber numbers missed expectations, but adjusted earnings beat estimates. The company also announced that it will be raising the prices of its ad-free versions of Disney+ and Hulu. Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith takes a look some stocks moving in after-hours trading.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: All right, let's take a look at what's trending after hours. A couple of stocks for you. Let's start off with Wynn Resorts, a look at the consumer, a look at spending patterns and we're looking at gains here in extended trading up just about 2%. Solid results from Wynn in its latest earnings report. Adjusted EPS coming in better than expected at $0.91 a share. Revenue also topping the Street's expectations at $1.6 billion.The company saying that this beat reflects strength in North America, also in Macau. When it comes to Wynn's Macau business, Wynn is saying that recovery there accelerating. They're seeing some strength in gaming, luxury, retail, and their hotel businesses.And this is a stock that's been a bit of under pressure here. Over the last three months, the shares up just about 9%. Year to date, though, we're still looking at gains of about 23%.Another look at the consumer with Sonos. The speaker company here up about 11% following their earnings results. Adjusted EPS coming in better than expected as well as revenue. That also topped what the Street was looking for.CEO Patrick Spence saying that it still remains a challenging environment, but he does believe that Sonos is positioned well to navigate this. We saw a massive drop following that last earnings result in the beginning of May. So we're looking at gains here in extended trading. When you take a look at the year to date move though, we're still in negative territory off just about 7 and 1/2%. But if these gains hold then, it could totally change things at tomorrow's opening bell.Story continuesLet's also take a look at Disney. The huge earnings report out after the bell this afternoon. We're now looking at losses of just about 1.7%.A bit of a mixed report revenue coming in just a bit shy of the Street's expectations. Also, subscriber numbers for their streaming business missing what the Street was looking for. Earnings, though, did beat the Street's expectations. And Disney also reporting a narrower than expected loss for its streaming business.Overall, a couple of key headlines coming from the earnings call that just got underway moments ago, Disney planning to raise prices for its streaming services. They're going to hike the price of its ad-free version of Disney Plus by 27%. It's now going to be $14 a month. That's up from $11 a month.Also, the ad-free version of Hulu is going to cost more. They're increasing that price of about 20% to $18 a month. So Disney certainly doing all it can to reach their goal of the streaming business being profitable by September of 2024, but we're still looking at losses of just nearly 2% here in extended trading.]"

This compares to year-ago revenues of $908.83 million.

The finding marks the first time since 2009—the earliest year that S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights estimates such data—that absolute emissions did not rise absent a major market disruption and decline in overall production.S&amp;P Global Inc. logoAbsolute emissions held steady at 81 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (MMTCO2) in 2022 while total production topped 3.1 million barrels per day (b/d), a gain of more than 50,000 b/d.*""The Canadian oil sands have demonstrated a consistent trend of reductions in GHG intensity for the past decade,"" said Kevin Birn, Vice President, Canadian Oil Markets Chief Analyst, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""The pace of production growth has historically outstripped the intensity improvements. That emissions held steady even as production grew is a significant first.""The S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights Oil Sands Dialogue analysis finds that the GHG intensity of oil sands production fell to 67 kilograms of ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" per barrel (kgCO2e/bbl) in 2022, the most recent year that S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights estimates are available. Since 2009 the average GHG intensity of oil sands production has declined 20 kgCO2e/bbl or 23%—an average decline of just over 1.5 kgCO2e/bbl per year or about 1.8%.The flattening of absolute emissions in 2022 amid rising production came from industry-wide GHG intensity improvements. This was also supported by production growth coming from oil sands operations with intensity that were below the sector average (such as Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage and Mined dilbit). At the same time, some of the more GHG intensive forms of production (such as Mined SCO) saw modest declines in output. The net effect was able to keep emissions flat even with the rise in overall production.Story continuesS&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expects the trend of oil sands GHG intensity reductions to continue and even accelerate in coming years.A previous Oil Sands Dialogue analysis estimated that absolute emissions would likely peak and begin to decline by the middle of this decade as GHG intensity improvements combine with slowing production. Absolute emissions are still expected to rise in the near term on account of more pronounced production additions expected in the next few years. However, the new findings indicate the potential for the peak to occur sooner and at a lower level than previously estimated. Moreover, with near term production growth expected to come from optimization and not new additions, those barrels could come at even lower intensity than anticipated.""We do not believe that absolute emissions from the Canadian oil sands have peaked, but it may be close,"" said Birn. ""The potential stalling of emissions growth in 2022 is a clear signal that oil sands absolute emissions will indeed peak and begin to decline, perhaps sooner than previously expected.""The new analysis was conducted in collaboration with the S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights Center of Emissions Excellence which is focused on the expansion and advancement of emission estimation capabilities across all S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights areas of research.* S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights has developed its own independent model and estimate of Canadian oil sands GHG emissions. S&amp;P Global Commodity Insight's estimate does not include emissions from the Sturgeon Refinery (also often referred to as the North West Redwater refinery) or the Bi-provincial upgrader.  We believe this is why our estimates for absolute oil sands emissions are approximately 3 MMTCO2e per year lower compared to the Canada National Inventory Report.Media Contacts: Jeff Marn +1-202-463-8213, Jeff.marn@spglobal.comGlobal/EMEA: Paul Sandell + 44 (0)7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.com Americas: Kathleen Tanzy + 1 917-331-4607, kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia: Melissa Tan + 65-6597-6241, melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodity markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We're a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

With each new generation of wireless connectivity, we strive to create shared success in collaboration with lawmakers and regulators, and to create new opportunities for local industries and communities.We implement our public policy approach around four key principles:Participation: We engage in policy discussions with governments, organizations and industries around the world to advocate for policies that promote innovation and protect and foster new ideas in wireless connectivity. We are committed to helping policymakers at all levels understand our business model and role as an ecosystem enabler.Responsible Governance: We abide by all applicable laws and regulations regarding political contributions and expenditures, and our contributions are subject to the approval of our senior management with oversight by the Governance Committee of our Board of Directors.Transparency: We publicly disclose to the Federal Elections Commission all political contributions made by our Company and our Political Action Committee, and we abide by all legal obligations of the FCPA and similar legislation around the world.Policy Guides: We carefully monitor and evaluate developments that affect the world of wireless connectivity.Our key public policy topics are 5G, invention and IP, spectrum, privacy, immigration and taxation. Our general positions are outlined below and published on our public policy website.We published our global tax strategy to highlight our commitment to being a responsible and transparent corporate citizen. Our approach to tax is consistent with our CoBC and Code of Ethics and is premised on complying with applicable tax laws, maximizing stockholder value and delivering transparent tax reporting and disclosures. We also seek to pay the requisite taxes on profits generated from the activities performed in each jurisdiction.Story continuesImplementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. To ensure that we can attract top talent, we must be able to hire the best engineers, regardless of their country of origin. Beyond fierce competition for talent across our industry and with our competitors, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign nationals, making the pool of available talent even smaller.We engage in public policy efforts to support regulations that are aligned to today's economic reality. Our Government Affairs team participates in diverse advocacy efforts that contribute to helping us ensure that immigration laws support our Company's ability to develop leading-edge technologies specifically and our innovation-based global economy in general.

To achieve these benefits, we believe governments must adopt policies that support a comprehensive 5G rollout plan.Invention and IP: Invention, innovation and protection of IP are core drivers of economic growth and competitiveness. Without robust patent systems and strong global protection of IP, innovation would be significantly weakened.Spectrum: The benefits of wireless connectivity depend on the availability of adequate and appropriate radio spectrum. We believe in freeing new spectrum in a responsible way to meet the demands of consumers and businesses.Privacy: We believe that cultivating consumer trust through a foundation of security and privacy practices helps drive broader adoption and more personalized wireless technology offerings.Immigration: Highly skilled talent, especially in the areas of math, engineering and the sciences, is vital to the success of our Company and to the future of technological innovation around the world.Taxation: We support policies that incentivize innovation and enable American technology companies to compLearn more in Qualcomm's 2022 Corporate Responsibility ReportView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/773322/Qualcomm-Supporting-Policies-That-Encourage-Innovation]"
114,a1edd4a7-e0ca-33e9-9c11-a575e4ce0497,QCOM,2023-08-10,20 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-internet-things-companies-125243316.html,1691585563,STORY,"['CSCO', 'PTC', 'HON', 'GE', 'TXN', 'NVDA', 'ORCL', 'IBM', 'QCOM', 'SAP', 'INTC', 'VZ']","[This article will talk about the 20 biggest Internet of Things Companies in the world. We have also covered interesting discussions on different IoT applications. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the World. As of 2022, the global Internet of Things (IoT) market was valued at around $544 billion. It's also estimated to grow significantly in the coming years, with projections indicating it will reach approximately $662 billion in 2023 and a whopping $3.35 trillion by 2030. This impressive growth is expected to result in a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.1% during the forecast period.Many big players in the industry, like Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Siemens AG, have been providing IoT platforms and solutions from deployment services to smart city initiatives and industrial edge solutions. These technologies enable the interconnection of devices using different communication technologies that offer valuable interoperable information without human intervention. If we are to speak about the biggest IoT products in the market, smart watches, smart refrigerators, medical sensors, and fitness trackers would all make it to the list. To read more about the impact of digitalization and artificial intelligence, you should check out our article on Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.How is IoT Making Waves in Industries?IoT has become a pertinent game changer in the healthcare industry by transforming surgical display technology. Through interconnected devices, IoT-enabled surgical displays can integrate data from various medical sources that can provide surgeons with a comprehensive view during medical procedures. Not only does real-time data sharing foster collaboration among medical professionals, it has also added to the quality of patient care and decision-making. Moreover, IoT has facilitated remote monitoring and troubleshooting of displays which has largely reduced downtime and ensures continuous functionality.Story continuesThe generosity of IoT services is not limited to the healthcare sector. In fact, it has tapped into the unexplored potential in urban transportation. The combination of electric bikes (e-bikes) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a win-win idea as E-bikes offer a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional commuting with addressing issues like traffic and pollution. On the other hand, IoT technology enhances e-bikes by providing real-time tracking, remote diagnostics, and seamless integration with other transport options through apps. This data also helps improve urban planning for better infrastructure and traffic management.Challenges for the Internet of Things to Look Out ForThe biggest challenge that comes with the IoT is the implementation of IoT security in the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. As IoT integrates the physical world with computer-based systems, the attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase and hence, attracts malicious actors. In industrial settings, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is especially critical but harder to secure due to long-standing, hard-to-upgrade components with limited maintenance windows.Existing IoT cybersecurity standards from organizations like NIST and ISA are complex which also makes implementation harder as technical documentation for some security standards runs over thousands of pages. Moreover, harmonizing security for both older ""brownfield"" and new ""greenfield"" systems is equally complicated and complex.Another challenge is that government regulations often lag the rapid evolution of IoT technology which leaves businesses without essential information to make decisions. The absence of robust IoT regulations contributes to its security risks, especially as critical devices like medical equipment and cars become connected.Quality control is challenging due to the influx of IoT devices from countries like China that have varying security standards. Thus, experts advocate for strong and universal security standards to address these concerns, as the potential attack surface expands to include more crucial devices. Moreover, the lack of sufficient regulation can raise eyebrows and lead to potential disaster scenarios in the IoT landscape.Let's now move to the biggest IoT companies in the world.20 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the WorldZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe methodology used to rank the Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the world is based on the annual revenue generated by IoT companies in 2022.

The cancer starts in the bone marrow and disrupts production of normal blood cells.""Although options for the treatment ... have expanded significantly in recent years, the disease remains incurable, and therefore, patients are in need of new treatment options,"" said Michael Andreini, CEO of the non-profit Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.The therapy's approval comes with FDA's ""boxed"" safety warning, flagging the risk of a type of aggressive immune response and neurologic toxicity.The accelerated approval is based on mid-stage trial data, which showed 73.6% patients achieved either partial or complete disappearance of cancer from their body.(Reporting by Mariam Sunny in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri and Maju Samuel)]"

PEP, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Intuitive Surgical Inc. ISRG, Kimberly-Clark Corp. KMB and Atmos Energy Corp. ATO.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Defensive Stocks for Stable Returns Amid Recent VolatilityWall Street has been witnessing volatile trading since the beginning of August. U.S. stock markets saw an impressive rally in the first seven months of this year after a disappointing 2022. Although the long-term trend is still bullish, investors should prepare for short-term fluctuations to protect their portfolios. Recent volatility arises primarily from three sources. Fed Reinitiates Interest Rate HikeOn Jul 26, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5.25-5.5%. This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001. Notably, since March 2022, the central bank hiked its interest rate in 10 consecutive FOMC meetings before taking a pause in the June 2023 meeting.It reinitiated the rate hike regime as the inflation rate remained elevated at almost double the Fed’s 2% target rate. In his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said ""The process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."" The central bank remains open to more rate hikes, depending on economic data. Fitch Downgrades U.S. RatingOn Aug 1, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA. The agency cited “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.” In May, Fitch placed the AAA rating of the nation on the negative watchlist.Fitch expects the general government deficit to rise to 6.3% of U.S. GDP in 2023 from 3.7% in 2022. The agency remained concerned about a steady deterioration in the standards of governance over the last 20 years. Notably, in 2011, S&amp;P had downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA.Story continues Moody’s Downgrade Ratings of U.S. BanksOn Aug 8, Moody’s Investors Service cut the rating of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. Moreover, the rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade. Moody’s also changed its rating outlook to negative for 11 banks.According to Moody’s, “U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets.”The rating agency also said “Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate portfolios.”Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, health care and utilities to safeguard one’s portfolio.

128,5e388d94-52c8-398e-a492-47ab8765b729,CCI,2023-08-10,Seeking up to 8% Dividend Yield? Analysts Suggest 2 Dividend Stocks to Buy,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seeking-8-dividend-yield-analysts-004622295.html,1691628382,STORY,"['JPM', 'KNTK', 'CCI']","[The strong year-to-date gains in the stock market are impossible to deny, but August’s losses serve as a reminder that investors need to have a cautionary plan for tougher times. Furthermore, according to strategists from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, these challenging times may be closer than we think.The gains have largely been powered by the AI boom in tech – and that has led to an unstable situation, with rising stock indexes resting on a narrow base. According to JPMorgan’s Chief Global Market Strategist Marko Kolanovic, the narrow base supporting the S&amp;P gains is a strong indicator of a bubble on the verge of bursting. “We remain of the view that the delayed impact of the global interest rate shock, steady erosion of consumer savings and post-COVID pent-up demand, and deeply troubling global geopolitical context will result in market declines and re-emergence of market volatility,” Kolanovic opined.Weighing in from Wells Fargo, global market strategist Scott Wren believes that the pace of inflation, which has moderated recently, could start accelerating again – and create additional pressure on the economy. “If inflation’s descent flattens out,” Wren says, “and reverses as interest rates rise higher, we believe the sectors that have driven this rally should be vulnerable to sharp pullbacks.”This isn’t to say that investors should stay out of stocks, but it is a situation that lends itself to taking a ‘preemptively defensive’ stance, and finding positions that will offer protection from a turn down. High-yield dividend stocks come immediately to mind. These stocks, offer steady passive income streams at inflation-beating levels, for a certain return should markets turn south.With this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pinpoint two stocks that match a solid defensive profile: a Buy rating from the analyst’s collective wisdom and up to 8% dividend yield. Let’s take a closer look.Kinetik Holdings (KNTK)We’ll start in the energy sector, where Kinetik bills itself as a ‘pure-play Permian midstream provider,’ that is, an operator involved in moving hydrocarbon and ancillary products from the production fields to the customers. The Permian formation, in Texas, and particularly the Delaware Basin area of it, is one of the world’s fasted growing regions for oil and gas development. Kinetik provides a range of gathering, compression, processing, transportation, and water management services.Story continuesKinetik’s network includes 4 cryogenic processing plants, and more than 1,700 miles of pipeline in its footprint area. The company’s systems can handle crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and produced water; the pipeline network features redundancy and reliability, and was designed to accommodate expansion activities.The oil price decline during the first half of 2023 had a noticeable impact on the company’s second-quarter financial results. The company’s revenue stood at $296.2 million, marking a 16.7% year-over-year decrease and falling short of projections by $28.06 million. On the positive side, the company’s EPS of $0.41 beat the estimates by 3 cents per share.Of interest to dividend investors, Kinetik had $126.7 million in distributable cash flow, a non-GAAP measure that typically supports the dividend payment. The company made its most recent dividend declaration on July 20, for Q2, and set the payment at 75 cents per common share. At this rate, the dividend annualizes to $3 and gives a forward yield of 8.62%.Covering this stock for Jones Research, analyst Eduardo Seda puts an emphasis on Kinetik’s ability to ensure capital returns, noting, “Since its formation, KNTK’s primary objective has been to increase shareholder value by continuing to provide stable and sustainable cash dividends over time while ensuring the ongoing stability and growth of its business.”“We believe KNTK’s structured contracts enhance the stability of the company’s revenue, gross margin, and cash flow generation, and to a greater extent, dividend coverage protection as dividend growth is based on long-term sustainability,” the analyst added.Along with these comments, Seda gives KNTK shares a Buy rating with a $43 price target indicating his confidence in a 23% potential upside for the next 12 months. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~32% potential total return profile. (To watch Seda’s track record, click here)Overall, there are 4 recent analyst reviews on file for Kinetik’s stock, and they break down 3 to 1 favoring Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $34.92, and their $39 price target implies ~12% upside on the one-year horizon. (See KNTK stock forecast)Crown Castle (CCI)Switching gears, we’ll look at Crown Castle, a real estate investment trust engaged in the ownership, management, operation, and leasing of diverse real estate holdings. What sets Crown Castle apart is its unique approach within the REIT framework, centering its endeavors around communications infrastructure. More precisely, Crown Castle specializes in the acquisition of indispensable cellular network tower and transmitter sites.Crown Castle has been in business for more than 25 years, and its network stretches across the lower 48 states with a particular focus on major urban areas. The company has over 40,000 cell towers in its portfolio, along with more than 85,000 route miles of fiber optic cables, and over 120,000 small cells on contract. Crown Castle builds its business, and its profits, on the continuing expansion of consumer demand for wireless connectivity.The company reported its results for 2Q23 in mid-July and showed year-over-year gains. Crown Castle’s total revenue reached $1.87 billion, surpassing forecasts by $10 million and marking an 8.1% year-over-year increase. The revenue was driven by a 10% y/y rise in site rental revenue, totaling $1.73 billion. Additionally, the firm’s bottom line earnings figure, of $1.05 per diluted share, came in 1 cent better than the estimates – and was up 8% from the year-ago period.Dividend investors should note that Crown Castle’s AFFO, adjusted funds from operations, a metric that supports the dividend, grew 14% y/y to reach $2.05 per share. This was more than enough to fully cover the company’s regular share dividend, which was declared on July 21 for $1.565 per share. This payment will go out on September 29; at its current rate, it annualizes to $6.26, and yields a solid 6%.Analyst Marie Ferguson, from Argus, covers this stock, and is impressed by Crown Castle’s use of the REIT model to leverage cell networks for profits. She says of the company, “We expect CCI to benefit from the increased demand for 5G wireless communications, and have a positive view of its focus on small cells, which can be used to improve communications in congested urban areas and expand service to underserved rural communities. We note that CCI’s colocation tenants bear expenses under long-term leases, and that the current weighted average of its remaining contract terms is about six years… We expect carrier capital spending to increase in 2024, and believe that the current CCI share price offers investors a buying opportunity.”Looking ahead, Ferguson rates CCI shares a Buy, and her $140 price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~34%. (Two watch Ferguson’s track record, click here)Overall, Crown Castle gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 15 reviews that include 8 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells. The company’s $129.60 average price target suggests a ~24% gain in store for the stock, from the $104.63 current trading price.

This compares to earnings of $0.57 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1,500%.

With that being said, let’s see if now is a good time to buy into the rally.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWilldan Q2 Review: Reporting second-quarter earnings last Thursday, Willdan Group showed it's thriving from a booming business environment in regard to infrastructure-related activities.To that point, Willdan offers services that include electric grid solutions, energy efficiency, and sustainability. The company’s Q2 earnings of $0.26 per share blasted expectations of $0.12 a share by 116%. Plus, this soared from an adjusted loss of -$0.06 a share in Q2 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSecond-quarter sales of $119.08 million leaped 16% year over year despite missing top-line estimates by 4%. Still, CEO Tom Brisbin stated Willdan is experiencing strength across all areas of its business resulting in improved profitability.Furthermore, cash generated from operations in the first half of the year has positioned Willdan to restart its share acquisition program while also raising its full-year guidance for all financial targets.This caused shares of Willdan to rally with many analysts beginning to raise their price targets. Notably, Willdan stock currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and its Engineering-R and D Services Industry is in the top 26% of over 250 Zacks industries.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSterling Q2 Review: Sterling Infrastructure also belongs to the top-rated Engineering-R and D Services Industry and reported its Q2 results on Monday. The E-Infrastructure, building and transportation solutions company saw Q2 earnings soar 47% from the prior-year quarter to $1.27 per share. This was a quarterly record for earnings and impressively topped Q2 estimates of $0.93 a share by 36%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, Q2 sales of $522.33 million were up 2% YoY and topped expectations by 6%. CEO Joe Cutillo highlighted that Sterling’s 230 basis points of gross margin and nearly 30% growth in EBITDA during the quarter reflect the company’s successful strategic shift toward higher-margin and lower-risk opportunities.  Sterling stock has soared 26% since its Q2 report with the company raising its fiscal 2023 EPS guidance to between $4-$4.20, up from $3.33-$3.53. With that being said, a buy rating could be on the way but Sterling stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) after such an extensive rally.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to Watch Other infrastructure-related stocks to watch among the Zacks Engineering-R and D Services Industry include Aecom ACM and Quanta Services PWR. Aecom reported its quarterly results on Monday with Quanta reporting last Thursday.While both companies came up slightly short of earnings estimates they beat on the top line and offer exposure to international infrastructure activities along with the U.S. The outlook remains favorable for Aecom and Quanta stock, solid annual top and bottom line growth is expected and they land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

146,361eb2ad-2053-4e52-89fd-d4c8fceee366,NKE,2023-08-10,"Gas prices are higher again, hitting consumers 'very directly and very profoundly'",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gas-prices-are-higher-again-hitting-consumers-very-directly-and-very-profoundly-142018507.html,1691590818,STORY,"['NKE', 'M', 'KSS', 'LULU', 'GPS', 'URBN']","[Gas prices are just plain high, and consumers are taking notice.As of Wednesday, the national average gas price stands at $3.83 per gallon, per AAA. That's lower than the average price this time last year, at $4.06, but slightly higher than last week's average price at $3.78.And that may have larger implications on consumer spending and how Americans feel about the economy, especially heading into the important back-to-school shopping season.""[Consumer] sentiment is very directly and very profoundly affected by gas prices,"" Michael Zdinak, economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance (see chart below). He added that there's a roughly 70% correlation between gas prices and sentiment over the time period shown below.One reason for that is consumers see gas prices and food prices move in real-time, he said.According to eToro global market strategist Ben Laidler, the move in gas prices from $3.09 in December 2022 to the national average price on Monday at $3.83 is an extra annual cost of roughly $101 billion for US consumers in total (based on the estimate that Americans use roughly 375 million gallons of gas each day).With where gas prices stand — and they should remain elevated — that means consumers have less money to spend elsewhere, such as discretionary purchases.'Sour outlook' for retailers?Higher gas prices, in addition to a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments this fall, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, higher cost of groceries, and a potential rise in the CPI reading due out this Thursday could form a perfect storm for US consumers — and change the way they shop.If American consumers' fears about the economy start to happen, incomes will take a hit, Zdinak said, which in turn could ""sour our outlook for spending.""Yet ""consumers have been shockingly resilient"" following a pandemic, ongoing war overseas, and a bank crisis earlier this year, he added — so it will take a lot to change the narrative this year.Story continuesSome of these themes are playing out in the back-to-school shopping season already underway.A Deloitte survey found that 68% of US parents expect to spend the same or less on back-to-school compared to last year. More than half (51%) said inflation is to blame for less disposable income while 75% said they plan to spend less because of higher prices.Although spending habits for the back-to-school season won't be reflected in next week's quarterly retail earnings results, Morningstar senior analyst David Swartz noted that ""expectations are not high, partly because of the gas prices and student loan payments but mostly because spending on apparel has cooled off since a very strong year in 2021.""""Retailers that cater to wealthier shoppers, such as Lululemon or Anthropologie, may be doing better than ones that sell to lower-income consumers, like Kohl’s or Urban Outfitters,"" said Swartz, who covers retailers such as Macy's (M), Nike (NKE), and Gap (GPS).A person pumps gas at a Shell gas station on August 03, 2023, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell via Getty Images)Excess savings to be depleted by the end of the year, per BNP ParibasThere's another factor that could affect consumers' ability to ride out higher gas prices: diminishing savings.""All this savings accumulated from the pandemic,"" BNP Paribas senior US economist Andy Schneider told Yahoo Finance. ""That was a real tailwind last year while the real wage story was a headwind, so ... now they've really flipped.""According to Schneider, those excess savings allowed consumers to ""shrug off"" headwinds such as higher inflation and high gas prices.But now, ""excess savings is becoming more of a headwind,"" he added. ""It's running down and we think that should be more or less depleted by the end of the year.""All this means less extra cash for consumers to sit on.""I think it's just a new era,"" Schneider said, adding: ""Now people are going to have to broach something like higher gas prices without being able to rely on a higher stock of savings that they had last year, and this year they don't.""Still, there may be some good news for Americans: Outside of a major shock to oil prices, the worst may be behind us when it comes to higher prices at the pump.""Barring a hurricane or OPEC production cut, we may have seen our peak and may see slight declines (not major),"" Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis, told Yahoo Finance. ""But with a lot impacting the market from economic data, etc, we're one surprise away from seeing gas prices going right back up.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But some on Wall Street don't believe it will be so straightforward.""It’s going to be a show-me story,"" Joel Simkins, a managing director in Houlihan Lokey's technology group, said via email.Among analysts' concerns: Competitors FanDuel and DraftKings (DKNG) have already seized large portions of market share in the US and believe they are closing in on profitability. All while Wall Street remains hyper-focused on whether expansive marketing spend can lead to profits after some in the industry have floundered. ""Just because you have a lot of eyeballs watching it doesn't translate to market share automatically,"" Simkins said.Penn is paying ESPN (DIS) $1.5 billion over 10 years and an additional $500 million in PENN stock warrants in exchange for exclusive rights to odds attribution, digital product integrations, and access to ESPN's talent. This means Penn's ""ESPN Bet"" branding and gambling odds will be plastered on the screen during game broadcasts and mentioned by on-air talent throughout shows.For ESPN, the deal offers an opportunity to ""significantly grow engagement with ESPN consumers, particularly young consumers,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said on the company's earnings call Wednesday.If successful, Penn believes the tie-up with ESPN could help bring the struggling online operator additional market share.In June 2023, Penn's then-Barstool-tied sportsbook produced revenue of $1.2 million in Pennsylvania, the largest state where Penn operates mobile sports wagering, representing about 3.5% of the market share. Meanwhile, FanDuel and DraftKings combined have a 72% share of the state, with FanDuel alone owning 49%. Penn has included incentives for ESPN based on how much market share it gains but declined to specify those metrics on the earnings call.Story continues""We're not doing this deal to be a 4% or 5% market share player,"" Snowden said on the call. ""That's not going to be acceptable for us. It's not going to be acceptable for ESPN. So you should assume if those are the ranges you're in, that's not going to work out long-term.""DraftKings and FanDuel haven't relied on broadcast partnerships to gain their market share either.

Paxos will also publish an independent third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets, PayPal said.In addition to the stablecoin, PayPal currently offers customers the ability to buy, hold, sell and transfer select cryptocurrencies. The company said it also provides educational content to help accountholders understand the risks and possibilities surrounding the technology.The launch comes as the federal government grapples with developing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.Story continues“It remains to be seen how PayPal’s stablecoin will be received by the crypto community,” Avi Mash, co-founder of blockchain and web3 consulting firm Block Fuel Group, told Kiplinger.However, he added, “the big takeaway here is that one of the most prominent web2 payments companies has deepened its commitment to blockchain, and this may help restart conversations about blockchain and web3 initiatives in corporate boardrooms that have been on hold for the last year.”GameStop to End Support of Its Crypto WalletCrypto Hackers Stole a Record $3.8 Billion in 2022.

In five years, we will look back at this exact moment and realize this was the beginning of the turn in history. Why do I say that?Up until this date, the majority of the builders in crypto were just that: in crypto. The largest companies operating the space were exchanges and stablecoin issuers. The largest market capitalizations were for the blockchains themselves. Most of the activity in the space was deeply self-referential, with the ICO boom, DeFi Summer, and the rise of NFTs all catering primarily to users and builders who were already in the space, enabling them to use more of the technology with each other.Austin Campbell is the founder and managing partner of Zero Knowledge Consulting, and an adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School.I’ve called this phenomenon the bad habit of building “more crypto for crypto” elsewhere, but up until this point in time, it is largely what defined the growth and evolution of the industry.That changed this week. PayPal, one of the largest payments companies in the world with 430 million-plus customers, has planted a flag saying that blockchain technology is important enough that they are willing to spend years building a product to evolve their business model. Of course, PayPal still has the PayPal app (and ubiquitous checkout button), PayPal still has Venmo. But now PayPal also has PYUSD.Why is this so important?Blockchains are a fundamentally different form of economic organization. A public blockchain, in particular, is an open, many-to-many interface for exchanging value without needing a centralized intermediary.PYUSD brings us back to the original promise of blockchain: the ability of a two-legged human, anywhere in the world, to send value to another two-legged human without having to trust or pay a bank (or worse, interminably long string of correspondent banks) to facilitate their transactions. This sort of platform erodes monopolies over time, allowing people to form their own financial connections without the need for centralized counterparties to control them. It returns the power over money to the people.Story continuesThis week the snowball was pushed from the top of the hillHowever, the value of a blockchain cannot be unlocked without something to do with it, and more importantly, something to do with it in the real world. This is where PYUSD alters reality as it comes online in various parts of the world over time. Now, by attaching a blockchain to the traditional PayPal platform, someone can send PYUSD to a relative, to a vendor, or to an employee anywhere in the world. (Or, at least, that’s the plan: for now, PYUSD is available only in the U.S.)This, of course, was true of previous stablecoins, but here is the important difference: that stablecoin now can become a PayPal balance. It can be easily cashed out through traditional rails. It can be kept as the stablecoin itself, knowing others can use these off-ramps. Liquidity increases value, and options increase value. PayPal, with PYUSD, has moved blockchains (it is building on Ethereum) from just being many-to-many for transactions to being many-to-many for the options of what to do with the value received after the transaction has occurred.Over time, the adoption of blockchain and faster, cheaper, safer transactions will now grow due to this fundamental shift. There are many companies and individuals sitting on the sidelines, unsure if they can trust crypto-native stablecoins, if crypto-native platforms are stable, and if others are going to use the technology to justify their own time and investment.PYUSD answers those questions: PayPal is building with the battle-tested NYDFS standard for stablecoins by partnering with Paxos; PayPal has been operating globally for multiple decades running a payments network; and PayPal has handled vast amounts of money safely, securely, and without losing user funds. Now, other builders and companies in the space can compose the PYUSD stablecoin into their own apps, their own protocols, their own wallets, or simply into the backend of their own internal systems, and have confidence it will work.Likewise, PayPal now has the ability to abstract away the fact that crypto is being used, upgrading the backend while the customer has a similar experience to their current products. This process will not be overnight, but will play out over years, or even decades. This week the snowball was pushed from the top of the hill.Read more: David Z. Morris - PayPal’s Real Stablecoin Strategy: It Wants to Earn Interest on Your DepositsThe regulatory and geopolitical ramifications of PYUSD should also not be underestimated. Stablecoins are here to stay. As technologists and financial professionals increasingly understand the implications of blockchains, there will be more of these efforts. PYUSD, using what is likely one of the two best regulatory frameworks in the world for stablecoins, is a demonstration that stablecoins can be done safely and with the same principles of fairness, consumer protection and stability that we already value in the traditional financial system.PYUSD will serve as a call to action for positive technological progress, and a warning to those who thought this would just go away. Those who believed that entrenched, decrepit monopolies would simply grind forward are now finding that they are very, very wrong. PayPal has fired the first shot among traditional firms at scale and become what is likely the first true web 2.5 company in the world, bringing blockchain and finance together at a scale that has previously been unachievable.I, for one, have never been more excited about the future of finance.]"

Maxine Waters (D-California) released a statement Wednesday saying she’s “deeply concerned that PayPal has chosen to launch its own stablecoin while there is still no federal framework for regulation, oversight, and enforcement of these assets.”PayPal (PYPL) introduced its new dollar-backed stablecoin, PYUSD, on Monday, the first time a global payments firm has issued its own stablecoin.Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Service Committee, noted that PayPal has 435 million customers around the world, more than the number of online accounts of all the largest banks combined.“Given PayPal’s size and reach, federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential in order to guarantee consumer protections and alleviate financial stability concerns,” Waters wrote.The House committee recently approved legislation seeking to set up guardrails for U.S. stablecoins, with several of Waters' fellow Democrats bucking her opposition to vote with Republicans.

Optimists see it as a watershed moment of validation for blockchain and smart contracts from a very serious fintech player.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.But there’s reason to suspect that technology per se wasn’t the most persuasive factor for the $64 billion payments giant. Instead, the more immediate motive may be quite simple:PayPal wants to collect the interest on your dollars.See, PYUSD, like other reputable dollar stablecoins, will be “backed” by a collection of dollar bank deposits and highly liquid dollar equivalents held in a trust managed by Paxos Trust. Short-dated U.S. Treasuries, which are likely to make up the bulk of PYUSD’s backing, are now offering a whopping 5% yield. PayPal gets to keep that yield.That puts a different spin on comments this week from Jose Fernandez da Ponte, head of PayPal’s crypto efforts. Da Ponte told CNBC Crypto that “we think of PYUSD as an extension of the PayPal balance … making it available outside of the PayPal ecosystem.”See also: PayPal's New Stablecoin and the '2 Wolves' Inside Crypto | OpinionA PayPal balance is the money a customer leaves on the platform — or now with PYUSD, money they leave with PayPal in exchange for PYUSD. Users, for the record, should absolutely not do this at scale, partly because your money is at risk of seizure (and can be seized in stablecoin form). More importantly, you shouldn’t leave a PayPal balance because PayPal doesn't pay any interest. That's why your money became PayPal’s revenue opportunity as soon as underlying interest rates started going up.How much money do people leave deposited on PayPal?PayPal doesn’t make the numbers entirely clear. In its quarterly reports, the company reports interest revenue on customer deposits to Wall Street as part of a larger category it calls “Revenues from other Value Added Services.” That includes “interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances,” but also a plethora of other revenue sources, including “referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees and other services.” So that category is not a clear index of how much “float” PayPal is getting from its users.Story continuesWhat we do know is that “value added” revenue is going up much, much faster than transaction fee revenue: It rose 37% between the second quarter of 2022 and the same period in 2023, while transaction revenue rose a measly 4.5%. It seems very likely that rising interest on customer deposits was a major driver of that divergence.These changing conditions would make a stablecoin vastly more appealing for PayPal, for two straightforward reasons. First, as Da Ponte implied, the extended services enabled by a stablecoin may encourage users to hold a larger amount of money in the form of PYUSD, and to hold it longer. In theory, that could happen if there are simply more ways to use PYUSD than a conventional PayPal balance — for instance, for crypto trading on decentralized-finance platforms. Those larger overall collateral balances would produce more interest for PayPal on the back end.(PYUSD will initially be available to U.S. users who have purchased crypto on PayPal before, but given the global nature of blockchain will likely be available worldwide in time.)But far more to the point, a stablecoin could be spent without the underlying balance *ever* having to leave PayPal’s coffers. A rent payment from a PayPal deposit currently has to be turned into real dollars to be sent to a landlord’s bank account, for instance. But the same landlord (or eBay seller, or what have you) might eventually be more willing to accept payment in PYUSD, and then use those tokens in turn to pay contractors or other service providers.See also: PayPal’s Regulated Stablecoin Is ‘Watershed Moment’ in CryptoThis would mean a smaller proportion of PYUSD users would “cash out” to actual dollars at any given point, leaving PayPal a higher proportion of Treasury or other interest as revenue. Its status as a publicly tracked blockchain token might even feed this dynamic, if enough users found that transparency more trustworthy than a simple number displayed on a web portal. Assuming we’re entering a period where interest rates will be higher for longer than over the preceding decade, this could accelerate the shift of PayPal’s revenue mix toward deposit interest earnings.Although the stablecoin field is somewhat crowded, if PYUSD catches on, it could be at least as important to PayPal’s corporate strategy as it is to the crypto sector.]"

Brendan Pedersen, Punchbowl News Financial Services Reporter and Author of The Vault, Punchbowl News' newsletter discusses potential use cases for the new stablecoin, noting that other nations have instant-payments systems and that stablecoins provide a private sector alternative.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: We're switching gears here, everyone. PayPal taking a deeper dive into the cryptocurrency space with its own US dollar-backed stablecoin. Customers will be able to use the new PYUSD to purchase products, send from person to person, transfer to other wallets, and they can also be converted to or from other cryptocurrencies that PayPal supports. So could Paypal's entrance into the space lend it some more legitimacy? Joining us now, we've got Brendan Pedersen, Punchbowl News Financial Services Reporter. Brendan, great to see you as always here. So help us break this down just a little bit more in PayPal's new foray into its own digital currency.BRENDAN PEDERSEN: Thanks for having me, Brad. Yeah, the big deal here is PayPal itself. I think there's a lot of stablecoins out there. But as far as new entrants goes, there are few fintech companies that are more ubiquitous than PayPal. So having that exposure to a stablecoin-like product for a lot of consumers is going to be significant.Now that said, there are a lot of obstacles here towards widespread adoption, right? Most vendors, at this point, do not accept stablecoins. So even if you are buying a bunch of Paypal's stablecoin USD, you're going to have to convert it back to that fiat currency most of the time, when you actually use it.Now that could change at some point. But the big thing that we are tracking here in Washington is going to be the role of FedNow. That's the instant payment system that the federal reserve has been trying to stand up for a long time, and actually launched last month with just a handful of banks. If a lot more banks take that up in the next couple of years, we could see a much lower demand for stablecoins, the type of product that PayPal is pushing right now. But if the government can't get that adoption, it may be up to private actors like PayPal to make that happen.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Brendan, I have to plead some ignorance on this, as I have ever since the concept of stablecoin was introduced and explained to me. Why-- what does this do for PayPal, or PayPal users? What is it for? I don't quite understand it, I have to admit.BRENDAN PEDERSEN: That's a great question. One thing that you will hear from a lot of policymakers, specifically, is they will-- instead of just saying stablecoins, they will say payment stablecoins, or dollar tokens. That gets at the core function of this thing. For a lot of people-- let me say this. For a lot of people, stablecoins are just another speculative investment.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, we have the dollar already, right?BRENDAN PEDERSEN: Correct. But I'll say this. The dollar is not instantaneous, right? The slowness of our payment system is behind most other peer countries around the United-- around the world.And so, when you're looking at-- Mexico has had an instant payment system for decades. Brazil's stood up one pretty quickly in the last decade or so. The UK has one. We are behind on this.Stablecoins are a private way to get instant payments, right? We don't have that at the government level. If we did, you don't need a private sector solution, if getting faster payments is really important. And for a lot of people, I should say, faster payments are really important.If you are living paycheck to paycheck, and you are waiting for a check to clear on a Friday, you might not get it, depending on how slow your bank is. And you might not be able to pay your bills. So there's definitely an economic case for this, particularly for low-income people. But it's-- until there's one company that comes along that has a significant amount of scale that can pull this together, or the federal government steps in and has a more functional product, we're not going to really know what this product can do.BRAD SMITH: Has sentiment recovered enough around stablecoins right now, Brendan? We've come a long way, many years, from Paypal's intentions to even be part of the Libra consortium. And now, they're launching this, their own digital currency.This one is with Paxos, I believe. And so, this, of course, also still comes after much of the algorithmic stablecoin debacle that ensued. So has stablecoin sentiment rebounded well enough?BRENDAN PEDERSEN: I think it depends on who you ask. I think, in general, yes. There is at least widespread expectation, or anticipation, from policymakers in DC that we need to do something about stablecoins. There is a fair amount of systemic risk that can get attached to a large enough stablecoin because you're talking about the creation of private money. And that can create funky things in an economy when it's not controlled by a centralized authority like the Fed.With that said, Republicans in the House are pushing really hard on stablecoin legislation. They just cleared a package through a markup on the House Financial Services Committee that would introduce first of its kind stablecoin regulations. And that had some, although not all, of the Committee's Democrats supporting it as well. But seven Democrats out of 20-something supported that bill.So in terms of acceptance, we're getting there. But I think, to Julie's earlier point, the question, really, is what is this for? And are people going to bother to go through all these hoops to figure out how exactly to deploy a stablecoin, and how to convert it back and forth, when all you're ultimately getting is money a couple days early?JULIE HYMAN: Brendan, thank you so much. Brendan Pedersen, Punchbowl News Financial Services Reporter. Good to catch up with you.]"

We have also covered interesting discussions on different IoT applications. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the World. As of 2022, the global Internet of Things (IoT) market was valued at around $544 billion. It's also estimated to grow significantly in the coming years, with projections indicating it will reach approximately $662 billion in 2023 and a whopping $3.35 trillion by 2030. This impressive growth is expected to result in a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.1% during the forecast period.Many big players in the industry, like Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Siemens AG, have been providing IoT platforms and solutions from deployment services to smart city initiatives and industrial edge solutions. These technologies enable the interconnection of devices using different communication technologies that offer valuable interoperable information without human intervention. If we are to speak about the biggest IoT products in the market, smart watches, smart refrigerators, medical sensors, and fitness trackers would all make it to the list. To read more about the impact of digitalization and artificial intelligence, you should check out our article on Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.How is IoT Making Waves in Industries?IoT has become a pertinent game changer in the healthcare industry by transforming surgical display technology. Through interconnected devices, IoT-enabled surgical displays can integrate data from various medical sources that can provide surgeons with a comprehensive view during medical procedures. Not only does real-time data sharing foster collaboration among medical professionals, it has also added to the quality of patient care and decision-making. Moreover, IoT has facilitated remote monitoring and troubleshooting of displays which has largely reduced downtime and ensures continuous functionality.Story continuesThe generosity of IoT services is not limited to the healthcare sector. In fact, it has tapped into the unexplored potential in urban transportation. The combination of electric bikes (e-bikes) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a win-win idea as E-bikes offer a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional commuting with addressing issues like traffic and pollution. On the other hand, IoT technology enhances e-bikes by providing real-time tracking, remote diagnostics, and seamless integration with other transport options through apps. This data also helps improve urban planning for better infrastructure and traffic management.Challenges for the Internet of Things to Look Out ForThe biggest challenge that comes with the IoT is the implementation of IoT security in the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. As IoT integrates the physical world with computer-based systems, the attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase and hence, attracts malicious actors. In industrial settings, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is especially critical but harder to secure due to long-standing, hard-to-upgrade components with limited maintenance windows.Existing IoT cybersecurity standards from organizations like NIST and ISA are complex which also makes implementation harder as technical documentation for some security standards runs over thousands of pages. Moreover, harmonizing security for both older ""brownfield"" and new ""greenfield"" systems is equally complicated and complex.Another challenge is that government regulations often lag the rapid evolution of IoT technology which leaves businesses without essential information to make decisions. The absence of robust IoT regulations contributes to its security risks, especially as critical devices like medical equipment and cars become connected.Quality control is challenging due to the influx of IoT devices from countries like China that have varying security standards. Thus, experts advocate for strong and universal security standards to address these concerns, as the potential attack surface expands to include more crucial devices. Moreover, the lack of sufficient regulation can raise eyebrows and lead to potential disaster scenarios in the IoT landscape.Let's now move to the biggest IoT companies in the world.20 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the WorldZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe methodology used to rank the Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the world is based on the annual revenue generated by IoT companies in 2022.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Marathon Petroleum's shares before the 15th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 11th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.00 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Marathon Petroleum has a trailing yield of approximately 2.1% on its current stock price of $144.05. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Marathon Petroleum has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 11% of its income after tax. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Marathon Petroleum generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The good news is it paid out just 10% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Marathon Petroleum's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 36% per annum for the past five years. Marathon Petroleum looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Marathon Petroleum has delivered an average of 16% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Marathon Petroleum for the upcoming dividend? We love that Marathon Petroleum is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Marathon Petroleum looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Marathon Petroleum for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

She spent her days talking to truck drivers and helping them get from point A to point B delivering fuel to stations across the state.""It was like coming into a puzzle each day,"" said Fenton. ""It was a job where you could come in and there was a different problem to solve.""Fenton started working for Marathon Petroleum after college. She was a cross country runner at the University of Findlay in Ohio and graduated in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in accounting. One of her teammates in college was a dispatcher for Marathon and invited her to a job fair. Fenton got the job and spent the next ten years supporting drivers on the road.""They are such good people, a ton of hard workers. I think I stayed in that role for so long because I wanted to help the team I had talked to for years. I really felt like I was making a difference,"" said Fenton. ""I would hear drivers say how long they had been in the industry and what they liked about it. Drivers seemed to really enjoy what they were doing. That inspired me to think maybe I could do this.""Fenton asked her managers about doing a ride along and started attending safety meetings to see if she would like driving. She realized that as someone who loves the outdoors and working with her hands, she wanted to change careers. She decided to get her Commercial Driver's License (CDL) and scheduled vacation time and switched shifts with other employees so she could attend a two and a half week driving school program.Story continuesFenton credits her trainer at Marathon, Mark Drummond, for mentoring her and making her believe she could succeed as a driver. Drummond had worked with Fenton for four years and felt her work ethic would make her perfect for the job.""She knew the back-office stuff, and everything always flowed with her,"" said Drummond. ""The way she understood the routes and the loading and unloading. It always made sense. Helping her transition to a driver was very easy. She absorbed everything like a sponge. She's very intelligent.""Drummond said that one thing that was different for Fenton than other drivers he trained was her petite size. He helped her adjust the settings and equipment to fit, but he let her figure out how to do other parts of the job.""The hoses we load and unload with are heavy, but she had to figure out her own way,"" said Drummond. ""I was hands off and let her figure it out. I couldn't do it for her, but I was there to build her confidence.""Today, Fenton loves being on the road and being in control of her day. She drives a semi-truck that pulls a trailer with up to 9,000 gallons of fuel or ethanol. Her shifts start at 5 a.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and every other weekend. Her husband is also a truck driver, and their shifts give them plenty of family time with their three children and three dogs.""I love working for Marathon as a truck driver,"" said Fenton. ""There's great pay and benefits. As far as delivering gas, Marathon teaches you everything you need to know to do your job safely and efficiently. They lay everything out for us. We just have to follow the plan.""Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Wednesday, August 9, 2023, Press release pictureFenton with her truck in Dayton, Ohio.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/marathon-petroleum-corporation Email: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/773493/Our-People-Hilary-Fenton-Dispatcher-to-Driver]"

Operating income of the segment totaled $2.3 billion, below our projection of $2.8 billion.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $36.8 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31 billion but declined 32.1% year over year.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteInside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $2.3 billion, which plunged from the year-ago profit of $7.1 billion. The decline primarily reflects lower year-over-year margins and refined product sales to go with a decrease in capacity utilization.Specifically, the refining margin of $22.10 per barrel compared to $37.54 a year ago though it came ahead of our estimate of $17.98. Capacity utilization during the quarter was 93%, down from 100% in the corresponding period of 2022. We expected the metric to be 91.3%. The year-over-year tick-down reflects planned maintenance activity in the Mid-Continent and West Coast regions.Meanwhile, total refined product sales volumes were 3,581 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), down from 3,615 mbpd in the year-ago quarter and our estimate of 3,630.2 mbpd. Throughput also fell from 3,069 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,925 mbpd but outperformed our estimate of 2,860 mbpd.MPC’s operating costs per barrel edged down from $5.19 in the year-ago quarter to $5.15. The company managed to reign in expenses due to lower energy outgo and disciplined execution. Our estimates factored in a higher unit cost of $5.20.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP MPLX — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, up 6.7% from the second quarter of 2022. Earnings were supported by higher tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Story continues Financial AnalysisMarathon Petroleum, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported expenses of $33.5 billion in second-quarter 2023, falling 27% from the year-ago quarter but coming above our projection of $24.5 billion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $562 million on capital programs (43% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 48% on the Midstream segment) compared to $577 million in the year-ago period. As of Jun 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $7.3 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $27.3 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 46.3%.In the second quarter, MPC repurchased $3.1 billion of shares and a further $800 million worth of shares in July. The company currently has a remaining authorization of $6.3 billion.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MPC’s second-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.87, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.54. The outperformance can be primarily attributed to lower expenses. The positives were partially offset by PSX’s declining refining margins worldwide.For the reported quarter, Phillips 66 generated $955 million of net cash from operations, down from $1.8 billion a year ago. PSX’s capital expenditure and investments totaled $551 million. It paid out dividends of $474 million in the reported quarter. As of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $3 billion. Meanwhile, Phillips 66 reported total debt of $19.9 billion, reflecting a consolidated debt to capitalization of 39%.Another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, also reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. The EPS of $5.40 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.08. This was on account of VLO’s increased renewable diesel sales volumes and a decline in total costs of sales.At the end of the second quarter, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.3 billion.

Blue Run is an award-winning whiskey brand launched in October 2020.This marks Molson Coors’ first spirits acquisition. With the addition of Blue Run, the company is likely to expand its portfolio beyond beer and aid its premiumization strategy.As part of this buyout, TAP has expanded its existing spirits business to form Coors Spirits Co., which will house Blue Run, Five Trail Blended American Whiskey, Barmen 1873 Bourbon and other future products.Prior to this, Molson Coors launched Five Trail Blended American Whiskey in 2021 and Barmen 1873 Bourbon in 2022.Blue Run is currently available in 31 states at retail and on-premise accounts, as well as online. Blue Run announced plans to build a distillery in Kentucky in March 2023, which will now be implemented by Molson Coors. The brand also has three upcoming whisky launches in late summer/fall.Blue Run’s founders — Mike Montgomery, Tim Sparapani, Jesse McKnight and Andy Brown — will continue to be associated with the brand.We believe that this acquisition is in sync with TAP’s efforts to grow market share through innovation and premiumization. In a bid to accelerate portfolio premiumization, the company has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio for the past few years.The company has highlighted that it has been making efforts to change the shape of its product portfolio and expand in growth areas. Its U.S. above-premium portfolio witnessed sales that outpaced its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.What Else Should You Know?Molson Coors is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. It intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space, and expand in adjacencies and beyond beer, without hampering the support for its existing large brands. Some other notable efforts include creating digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.Strength in its core brands, particularly Coors Light and Miller Lite, acts as a key growth driver. The company intends to increase investment in convenience store shopper marketing in the second half of this year. Also, favorable volume leverage is expected to partly offset cost increases. This, along with premiumization and lower contract brewing volumes, is anticipated to drive gross margin expansion for the year.Driven by these factors, 2023 sales are projected to grow year over year in the high-single digits on a constant-currency basis, up from the prior mentioned low-single-digit growth. This will be backed by sturdy demand in the United States, with growth in rates and volumes. Underlying EBT is likely to grow 23-26% year over year compared with the earlier stated low-single-digit growth on a constant-currency basis.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) have gained 16.4% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 4.1%.However, Molson Coors has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry due to pricing actions stemming from inflationary pressures. Also, cost inflation, with respect to materials and manufacturing expenses and unfavorable mix, remains concerning. Management anticipates the inflation impacts on cost of goods sold for 2023. Nevertheless, it is likely to moderate in the second half.Other Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely TreeHouse Foods THS, Associated British Foods ASBFY and Celsius Holdings CELH.TreeHouse Foods, a manufacturer of packaged foods and beverages, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). THS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 49.3%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TreeHouse Foods’ current financial year’s sales suggests a decline of 12.4% from the year-ago reported number.Associated British Foods is a diversified international food, ingredients and retail group, which currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. ASBFY’s expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is 7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Associated British Foods’ current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 30.4% and 4.2%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.Celsius Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). CELH specializes in commercializing healthier, nutritional functional foods, beverages and dietary supplements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CELH’s current financial-year sales indicates 67.9% growth from the year-ago reported figure, and the same for EPS implies a 154% rise.

So far, 80% of companies listed in the S&amp;P 500 index have reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data tracked by FactSet. That’s pretty good, especially since Q2 was forecast to be the trough for earnings this year. The second half of 2023 is expected to be much stronger. While a majority of companies beat estimates, some hit home runs, knocking the leather off the ball with their Q2 prints. In most cases, the stocks of these companies have risen sharply higher on the backs of strong earnings announcements. This portends good things for the companies as we move into the autumn. It also presents an opportunity for investors to capitalize on the strong performance. That an economic recession has yet to materialize is also good news. Here are seven stocks to snag after smashing Q2 earnings.Molson Coors (TAP)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comMolson Coors (NYSE:TAP) crushed its second-quarter financial results, reporting that its net income in the April through June period rose 624% from a year earlier to $342.4 million. The brewer, whose popular beer brands include Miller Lite and Blue Moon, said its net income in Q2 equated to $1.57 a share, up more than 600% from 22 cents a year earlier. The profit increase was driven by higher sales, which totaled $3.3 billion in Q2, up 14% from $2.9 billion in the same period of 2022.The company said sales volumes grew in its three largest markets: the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom, including its best sales growth in America since 2008. In terms of forward guidance, Molson Coors said it now expects an increase in its net income for all of this year in a range of 23% to 26%, up from a previous forecast of growth in the low single digits.

Intel’s gross margin in Q2 was nearly 40%, topping 37.50% a year ago. The strong Q2 print comes after Intel reported two straight quarters of financial losses, including the biggest loss in the company’s 55-year history in Q1 of this year.

The company just reported better-than-expected Q2 results and raised its forward guidance for the remainder of this year. The soft drink maker announced EPS of 78 cents versus 72 cents which was the consensus forecast on The Street. Revenue in the quarter ended June 30 totaled $11.97 billion compared to $11.75 billion which was forecast among professional analysts.Coca-Cola lifted its guidance for the remainder of 2023. It now expects EPS growth of 5% to 6%, up from a previous forecast of 4% to 5%. The company also raised its outlook for its revenue growth, predicting an increase of 8% to 9%, up from 7% to 8%. Coke attributed the beat and raise to price increases on its products that were made in response to inflation.

One of the standout prints came from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The second-largest lender in America beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. All thanks to a surge in interest rate income. It also reported EPS of 88 cents versus 84 cents which was expected. Revenue for the quarter came in at $25.33 billion compared to $25.05 billion that had been forecast.Bank of America’s strong financials were due primarily to higher interest rates charged on commercial and consumer loans. The lender did warn that its loan and deposit growth has slowed in recent weeks as the U.S. economy begins to cool due to elevated interest rates. But long-term, the bank sees continued growth ahead. BAC stock has pulled back 7% this year, but the retreat is due to several regional banks collapsing this past spring.

That is, insiders acquired the stock in greater numbers than they sold it.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Waters The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At WatersThe Independent Director Mark Vergnano made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$998k worth of shares at a price of US$313 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$292 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Mark Vergnano.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeWaters is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of WatersMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Waters insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$68m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Waters Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Waters insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Waters insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Waters has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.Of course Waters may not be the best stock to buy.

View our latest analysis for AES The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AESIn fact, the recent purchase by Maura Shaughnessy was the biggest purchase of AES shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$19.61 per share to be enticing. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. Happily, the AES insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices.

Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian breaks down the top takeaways from the 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ's unveiling.Video Transcript- Yahoo Finance attending the unveiling today of the 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ. Pras Subramanian spoke with Mark Reuss, the President of GM, and joins us right now here on set.And Pras, when it comes to GM, Cadillac, their vision here for EV, how the Escalade fits into all this, one of the things that jumped out to me is that price tag $130,000. How widely adopted would a vehicle that expensive be when you compare it to what the gas-powered price is, and it's significantly lower than that?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, you were just talking about that just now, about how the base, base gas-powered version of the Escalade is $80,000, give or take, $130,000 for the EV version. I got to say though, it is a little bit different. It's definitely they've added more niceties. It's got the full length curved display there, 450 miles of range, like I say, it's really a big deal for them.This is a three-year-old SUV electric that doesn't exist, right. There's not many or any I can think of full-size electric three-row SUVs right now. You have the Tesla Model X, which is a three-row, but it's kind of not the same footprint. You have cars like the Kia EV9 coming out in the future. Now that car is a much lesser in terms of it's not a luxury mobile, right. So it's a different player in that field.So I think it's sort of a unique thing. I think for Escalade buyers, $130,000 is probably not crazy for them. They're probably paying $100,000-plus for the gas-powered version of this car. So I don't think it's that much of a step up for them to go fully electric here, brand new car.It's a different type of design, both inside and out. I think they might want to pay up for that sort of prestige of a new EV. So I could see it doing OK if they can actually build enough.Story continues- Um, Kras, we've been talking a lot about these new cars coming to market with a very steep price tag, some of the bigger cars as well. How is GM thinking about the overall pie, where the demand is in this EV transition? Is the idea is to still go for the higher price tag here because that's where the money is? Or are they sort of looking to just go with the full stack?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: They're really going to go with the full stack because Cadillac of course, is there-- they're sort of the high-end luxury, ultra sort of the brand that's the pinnacle of GM, right.But they're also going to come out with, like you mentioned, the Silverado EVs. That truck is being built right now. That's going to have a work truck version that'll cost from $50,000. And they're also going to come out with the Equinox EV, the Chevy Equinox. That's an SUV that'll cost around $30,000.So they're going to come out with these cars in the back half or second half of 2023. So they're all going to come online at the same time in conjunction.But you notice I asked Mark about the UAW talks. It's something that GM mentioned could be a potential issue for them as they raise their guidance last quarter. They say if a strike happens, we're not going to be able to hit those numbers.I think for sure they're going to have problems rolling out all their EVs and those EV ambitions if these factories, like factories here in Detroit, are not online this fall. On the 14th of September is the deadline for new contracts. So you have this in the mix too.But if they were able to make a deal, it sounds like those factories in Spring Hill, Tennessee and also in Lordstown, Ohio are going to be pumping out those Ultium cells for the battery. So it sounds like they're all set. The question is, can they actually line everything up just right?- Yeah, certainly timing the big issue here and whether or not they'll be able to meet some of those deadlines. All right, Pras. Thanks.]"

The Escalade EV is here in New York. The big reveal. Mark Reuss, President of GM, joining me now to discuss. So Mark, franchise-- the Cadillac Escalade franchise is a big one for a number of reasons. What are some of the key sort of features you need to kind of hit with this car to sort of make that mark?MARK REUSS: Well I think, you know, it's become an icon since we introduced it. But we sold over a million units, which, that's a big number for something like this. So it's been Cadillac's flagship until we announced we're doing CELESTIQ. So we kind of have two flagships here. A sedan or sort of a low coupe, if you will. And then we have the Escalade icon, now IQ for the EV piece of it.So it's a big deal. This has always been a technological bed for us when we introduce it. And you saw the first OLED curved screen on the last Escalade internal combustion engine version that we just saw. Here, you're going to see a 55 inch screen that's pillar to pillar. So we do things like that. We also do a lot of things like supercruise that are sort of-- we put it on Escalade, we put it in Cadillac. Cadillac's always going to lead with us as a brand, too.Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So you know, over 450 miles of range, that twin motor setup. You said that curved display all across the entire dash. This car is a little bit different than the traditional Escalade. But it kind of has to be, right?MARK REUSS: It has to be. Because, you know, if you look at this, you know, we're not going to see people instantly buy something that's different like an EV. And so this is plus business for us. We have a lot of demand for an Escalade or an SUV that is luxury that is an EV. We know that.So the demand is here. We're going to be first in, again, with Escalade and the EV. That's important for us, to be first. And so it is. But it's different than an ICE vehicle. So, you know, we're going to do both. And here in New York, you know, see black escalades All over the place.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Everywhere.MARK REUSS: Yeah, everywhere on a fleet basis. And, you know, that's business for us, but it's also huge business for our fleet customers. And we love that. As we introduce a, you know, electric version of this, there'll be fleets that have zero emissions in mind. So there's going to be a good fleet business here, too. So we'll see.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, I've already seen some LYRIQ SUVs in the fleet, livery business here in New York City. And you mentioned, that's going to be a big business for you guys here. So that rollout for the LYRIQ, you guys took your time with it. You kind of couple hundred and there to sort of get that ramp just right. Are we going to see a similar type of ramp with Escalade next year when it comes out?MARK REUSS: I think it'll be a little bit different. And the reason why I say that is because people forget that as we bring our assembly plants to build-- Factory Zero's going to build this Escalade right in Detroit. As we bring those assembly plants online, we're also bringing on for the first time, you know, our cell plants. So in Lordstown, Ohio, is being brought on at the same time we're bringing these vehicles online.So we're taking this a step at a time. Now that's fully capacitized, we're going to move it into Spring Hill and start making cells there. And then Lansing, Michigan, as well. So Tennessee, Lansing, and Ohio, we bring those on right as we do these vehicles. This will have a different ramp than LYRIQ did, just because we're already starting production of the Silverado truck, pickup truck, in Factory Zero.So they both carry, you know, the 12 mod packs. We've got some experience on it. So I think it's going to go a little bit different than LYRIQ was. And LYRIQ was really our first electric vehicle for Cadillac.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, you mentioned those factories. Spring Hill, for one. GM, the entire company, going through a whole EV transformation. From your sort of point of view, and you were sort of an architect for Cadillac's electrification plans, how is that transformation going on? How's that happening right now?MARK REUSS: It's really-- you know, about, I want to say almost five years ago, we decided that we were really going to embrace this. Because the regulatory environment, but also the customer acceptance of EVs we saw was going to be very high. And a lot of people doubted that. But you can see it now. It's happening, right?And so you get into an electric vehicle and they drive it. They're thrilled with it. The charging infrastructure is now coming, both from a federal standpoint, but also you see the alliance of the seven companies installing our charging stations. You see adoption of some of our charging standards that are different than they are now today. So it's all happening. You see oil companies putting electric infrastructure in.So a lot of that's happening. We got to get the range right. We do with 450 here, 312 on the LYRIQ. Those are big numbers for people. And now they can say, OK, I can really see myself doing this every day and using this as my primary car. So it's going well.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Was that 450 number kind of big for current Escalade customers who really-- I guess they want that range, huh?MARK REUSS: Yeah. I mean, if you look at the V, the V Escalade it's right in the-- yeah, they want that. But also, they want the power. And this is-- if you look at this, this is around 750 horsepower from battery electric standpoint. So this is a really fast, fun car. And it's got a lot of range. So it's cool.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, I drove that Escalade V, and let me tell you, it sounds like unlike anything I've ever driven before.MARK REUSS: That's right. That's right. That's right.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I want to quickly mentioned real quick, Mark, while we have you, you mentioned Factory Zero, where this car's being made, GM, the Big Three, in talks with the UAW right now. Are you confident a good deal can kind of come about for both parties here?MARK REUSS: I think that's-- all I can say about that is that we are negotiating in true, you know, trust and form that-- to get an agreement for everybody that works for everybody. And that's in good faith.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So quickly pivoting also. One other thing that I think you and I both fans are is racing. Cadillac almost wrapping its LMDh with a endurance hypercar sort of season here, both in Europe and abroad. Great season so far. Podium and Lamar, I believe so. What's your sort of take on the racing program as an extension of the brand here for Cadillac as it goes through the future?MARK REUSS: Well, I think, you know, we started racing Cadillacs. But it's the 20th anniversary of the V series this year, which is-- it makes me feel old.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right, right, right.MARK REUSS: Right, yeah. But we raced in what was called the Speed World Challenge. And then we raced ATS's and then CTS's. But those were very important for people to think at that time 20 years ago differently about Cadillac.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Because, you know, as you think about it--MARK REUSS: No, no, you don't. You don't, so. But I think if you look at the V series today, you know, particularly the Blackwings, are noticed and, you know, commented on as the best sports sedans out there today. That's a big deal. And so that's a lot of hard work from a lot of our people. And it's a lot of recognition from the automotive community. So the power technology story for Cadillac will extend into electric vehicles as well. So look for performance variants of those two.And so that's part of the DNA. So power. It's American brand, it's not a copy. It's American luxury. So it's a reflection of us as a country. And that's a really important part of the DNA of Cadillac.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, those hybrid motors, those V-8s and those LMDh cars, I hope you guys can preserve that sound as long as possible. But I know the future's coming and EVs are here. Mark, thank you so much.MARK REUSS: It's pretty cool. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. Thank you.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Thanks again.MARK REUSS: Thank you.]"

It may appear less tall, with its more sloping cabin and angular 'D' pillar by the rear hatch, but the Escalade IQ is just as imposing as its gas-powered brother.The Escalade IQ also houses a number of technical innovations. For instance: a full-dash length curved LED touchscreen measuring 55 inches diagonally. Also, GM’s latest Supercruise self-driving tech and a massive 200 kWh Ultium powertrain are good for an estimated 450 miles of range and 750 horsepower.Front 7/8 view of Cadillac ESCALADE IQ Sport in Flare Metallic with shield-shaped grille in view. (Photo courtesy of GM) (Cadillac)""[The Escalade] has always been a technological bed for us,"" GM President Mark Reuss said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Reuss has been dubbed the ""architect"" of Cadillac’s electric transformation, which the company began in earnest five years ago with a goal of full electrification by 2030.For GM, the Escalade is the straw that stirs the drink when it comes to electrification.Cadillac already has the LYRIQ compact SUV EV on sale at the moment. But the Escalade will be the nameplate that really shows the world that Cadillac is becoming a true electric brand. The Escalade franchise, after all, has sold over 1 million vehicles — and that's where Cadillac customers expect GM to showcase its technological innovations.""You saw the first OLED curved screen in the last Escalade,"" Reuss said, noting that Cadillac is taking the tech and interior design up a notch in the new IQ. Reuss also predicted loyal Escalade buyers will be keen to purchase an electrified version too, as long as it meets some conditions, such as luxury appointments and a long cruising range.Full side view of Cadillac ESCALADE IQ Sport in Flare Metallic at sunset. (Photo courtesy of GM) (Cadillac)""We have a lot of demand for an Escalade or an SUV that is luxury, that’s an EV. We know that,"" Reuss said. ""So the demand is here. We're gonna be first in again with Escalade and the EV, and it’s important for us to be first,"" Reuss said.Story continuesBeing first is important, as there is no real competitor in the market yet for a full-size, three-row electric SUV. When Escalade IQ rolls off the Factory Zero assembly line in Detroit next year, the only real options will be the much smaller Rivian R1S; the Tesla Model X, which also has a smaller footprint than the Escalade IQ; and the Mercedes EQS SUV, again with a smaller footprint.Kia’s upcoming EV9 will be a competitor in the size category but not the luxury one, and Land Rover’s Range Rover EV is still a few years away.View of front seats, steering wheel, and pillar-to-pillar screen in Cadillac ESCALADE IQ Sport. (Photo courtesy of GM) (Cadillac)Part of the appeal of the Escalade IQ for both new buyers and Escalade loyalists is the 450-mile range. Along with curing that dreaded range anxiety with that larger battery, the Escalade IQ is capable of a 100-mile reach in only 10 minutes of charging. (Using a 350kW DC fast charger.)Speaking of fast, when the Escalade IQ does begin production at Factory Zero in Detroit, Reuss anticipates that the ramp-up in production won’t take as long as the LYRIQ’s production. That's because battery production at GM’s plants in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Lordstown, Ohio, will be happening concurrently.""This will have a different ramp than LYRIQ did just because we're already starting production of the Silverado pickup truck in Factory Zero — they both carry the 12 mod [battery] packs. We've got some experience on it,"" he said.Rear 3/4 view of Cadillac ESCALADE IQ Sport in Flare Metallic. (Photo courtesy of GM) (Cadillac)But a possible hiccup is the ongoing negotiations with the UAW over a new contract with GM and its big three rivals Ford and Stellantis. Without a new contract, the UAW may implement a work stoppage on September 14 when the current labor pact ends.Reuss wouldn't comment on the status of those negotiations, but he said GM is negotiating for a deal ""that works for everybody in good faith.""With the excitement seen at the launch of the Escalade IQ, it seems both GM and its UAW partners will be keen to make a deal — and get to work on one of the most anticipated vehicles in Cadillac’s 120-year history.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Morgan investor conference, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the automaker's electric vehicles, from Cadillac Lyriq SUVs to BrightDrop vans, had been affected by an issue with assembling battery modules - a stumbling block first noted last week by Chief Executive Mary Barra.Jacobson said GM had built more than 1,000 Lyriqs in July -- still well below the company's initial expectations.GM in early 2022 said it expected to build 25,000 Lyriqs at the company's Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant last year, but fell far short of that target. In the first six months this year, GM delivered fewer than 2,400 Lyriqs to customers, as it struggled with batteries and other issues.Jacobson pointed to its majority-owned Cruise automated vehicle operation as a bright spot, as the unit enters a ""big phase of operational expansion,"" with more than 400 vehicles on the road.Cruise has ""largely solved all the technology challenges,"" Jacobson said, and is still targeting $1 billion in revenue in 2025 and growing margins as costs continue to come down.

United first sought an extension in late June.Airlines can lose their take-off and landing slots at congested airports if they do not use them at least 80% of the time.The FAA said it was working closely with a major air traffic controller union to implement a long-term solution to resolve ongoing low staffing levels at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON).A government audit in June said the FAA faced critical air traffic staffing and disclosed New York TRACON staffing was at 54% compared with optimal levels.The FAA said the waiver had ""provided stability at the NYC area airports"" but told airlines not to expect additional waivers based on agency staffing beyond Oct. 28. It also urged airlines to use larger planes to transport more passengers.Airlines for America, an industry trade group said on Wednesday it appreciated the waiver extension while the FAA navigates air traffic controller staffing shortages.U.S. airlines will continue to operate larger aircraft to reduce pressure on national air space, the group added.Chicago-based United said last month it would drop to about 395 daily flights from 410 at Newark Liberty International Airport after planning 438 on peak days before the FAA's March waiver.Last summer, there were 41,498 flights from New York airports where FAA air traffic control staffing was a contributing factor in delays.In March, FAA said later this year it planned to reassign approximately 100 square miles (259 square km) of Newark airspace from the area known as N90 to the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control to address staffing issues. That reassignment has not yet occurred. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Jamie Freed)]"

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts Trim Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.A series of daily 1% changes in the S&amp;P 500, whether it goes up or down, for an entire week might lead to a situation where the strong rise in US stock prices could face substantial challenges. This insight comes from Nomura's cross-asset strategist, Charlie McElligott, who has observed that volatility-control funds have significant stock investments. Due to this high exposure, the possibility of a market decline has increased, especially after a period of calm trading over the past few months, reported Bloomberg. If the S&amp;P 500 experiences consistent 1% fluctuations every day for a week, the potential exists for a significant drop in the ongoing upward trend of US stocks. This heightened risk is tied to the exposure of funds that aim to manage volatility, which are closely tied to stock market movements. The upcoming test will be how the market reacts to US inflation figures, which could increase volatility. On August 10, European stock markets experienced an increase in their values. This growth was supported by luxury brands' positive performance, resulting from China easing certain pandemic-related restrictions. Concurrently, the dollar's value decreased in anticipation of upcoming U.S. inflation data. This data is significant as it could influence the decisions made by the Federal Reserve regarding its policies.According to economists surveyed by Reuters, there's an expectation that consumer price inflation in the United States for July will see a slight uptick to an annual rate of 3.3%. Additionally, the core inflation rate, which excludes the more volatile food and energy sectors, is predicted to increase by 0.2% in July, resulting in an annual gain of 4.8%. History has shown that inflation can persist longer than expected once it becomes high. A former Fed Governor, Richard Clarida, cautions against prematurely declaring success in controlling inflation. The upcoming CPI report is expected to reveal a slowdown in the pace of price increases, but not enough for the Federal Reserve to step back from its efforts to combat inflation. If the Wall Street consensus is accurate, the consumer price index will show a 0.2% monthly increase for July and a 12-month rate of 3.3%. This is notably lower than the 8.5% annual rate reported a year ago. When excluding food and energy, the monthly estimate remains at 0.2%, with a 12-month rate projected at 4.8%. While this seems to be positive news to some extent, various data points suggest that inflationary pressures have considerably eased compared to 2022. Richard Clarida, now an advisor for Pimco, suggests that the Federal Reserve should continue its efforts to combat inflation and avoid premature declarations of success. He emphasized the importance of acknowledging improving data while keeping options open and maintaining the fight against inflation, reported CNBC. Oil prices stabilized on Thursday as investor wariness before U.S. inflation data slightly eased an ongoing price increase due to supply constraints. Brent crude rose by 14 cents to reach $87.69 per barrel as of 0757 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude inched up by 1 cent to $84.5. Oil prices have risen recently due to Saudi Arabia and Russia extending output cuts. Additionally, concerns about supply have emerged due to the possibility of tensions between Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea region, which could jeopardize Russian oil deliveries.Story continuesOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on media and entertainment conglomerate The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), energy stock Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) alongwith biotech firm Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). Check out the complete article to see details of these and other stocks.Wall Street Analysts Trim Price Targets for These 10 StocksSource: pexels10. Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN), a company located in New Haven, Connecticut, is working on creating treatments that break down harmful proteins causing diseases. They use a special platform called PROTAC® Discovery Engine to develop targeted protein breakers. These breakers utilize the body's natural system for removing proteins, helping eliminate disease-causing proteins effectively.On August 9, Piper Sandler made a notable adjustment to the price target of Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN), a company within the spotlight of their analysis. This adjustment entails a decrease in the projected price target, which has been revised from its prior value of $81 to a new target of $70. This modification in the price target signals Piper Sandler's revised assessment of Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN) potential valuation within the market. The decrease of $11 suggests that Piper Sandler's experts have re-evaluated their expectations for Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN) performance, considering various factors that could influence the company's growth trajectory.Just like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), the sentiment is bearish for Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN).09. Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29On August 9, RBC adjusted Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL) price target, reducing it from $27 to $23. This shift reflects heightened competition in the advertising market, according to RBC. Despite the target cut, RBC maintains an ""Outperform"" rating for Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL), suggesting optimism about the company's performance compared to market averages. The change indicates a $4 shift from the previous target and highlights the importance of monitoring market trends for informed investment decisions.Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy made the following comment about Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The most significant detractors from the Portfolio’s relative performance in the quarter included Azenta, Warby Parker, and Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL). Finally, Bumble, a leading online dating app known for its strong, women-centric brand, was another detractor. We do not believe the stock’s poor performance is driven by fundamentals, which have remained strong amidst an uncertain economic backdrop. As one measure of this, the Bumble app recently became the most downloaded dating app in key markets such as the US, Canada, Australia, the UK, and Germany—all without a commensurate increase in marketing spend. We believe the stock was weighed down by fears sparked by the poor performance of competitor Match Group, which is experiencing growth challenges as the Tinder platform matures, as well as a pickup in secondary activity from private equity owner selling. We used this volatility to add to our position in Bumble.”08. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is a company that offers on-demand ridesharing services. Its success is closely connected to the technology industry, and its future depends on how well it can reduce expenses and make operations more effective. This is crucial as the company's stock price has dropped significantly, falling from over $70 to around $10.Stephen Ju, an analyst associated with Credit Suisse, on August 9, upheld his positive ""Outperform"" rating for Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), the ride-hailing company. However, he has opted to revise down the projected price target for Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares. Previously set at $23, the new price target stands at $18, as per Ju's evaluation. This action by Stephen Ju indicates his continued belief in Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) potential to outperform market expectations. Despite the adjustment in the target price, his overall outlook for the company's performance remains optimistic. The revised target signifies a decrease of $5 from the previously anticipated value of $23. This adjustment signals a notable shift in Ju's assessment of Lyft's potential valuation.Similar to how The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) are all experiencing negative sentiment, the outlook is also pessimistic for Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT).07. Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ: LYFT) is a company that offers on-demand ridesharing services. Its success is closely connected to the technology industry, and its future depends on how well it can reduce expenses and make operations more effective. This is crucial as the company's stock price has dropped significantly, falling from over $70 to around $10.Citigroup revised Willis Towers Watson Public Company's price target (NASDAQ:WTW) on August 9, now setting it at $221 instead of the previous $251. Despite this adjustment, Citigroup maintains its stance with a ""neutral"" rating for the company. The decision to lower the price target results from the analysts' careful evaluation of Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) performance and the prevailing conditions within the market. This alteration indicates a reduction of $30 from the previously projected value, which signifies Citigroup's updated perspective on the potential worth of Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) within the market. While the target has been decreased, the decision to keep a ""neutral"" rating suggests a cautious approach on Citigroup's part.06. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46On August 9, Wells Fargo, a notable financial institution, adjusted the target price for Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). This adjustment involves a reduction in the target price, which has been lowered from its previous value of $165 to the new level of $135. Concurrently, Wells Fargo has opted to maintain its assessment of the stock's rating with an ""Equal-weight"" classification. The decision to lower the target price signifies Wells Fargo's updated analysis of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) potential value in the market. This shift in projection by $30 suggests that Wells Fargo's experts have re-evaluated their expectations for the company's performance and market positioning. Despite the decrease in the target price, retaining an ""Equal-weight"" rating suggests a neutral perspective on the stock. This could indicate that Wells Fargo believes Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) performance might align with broader market expectations without significant outperformance or underperformance.Smead Value Fund made the following comment about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Our biggest detractors were Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Warner Brothers (WBD), and Pfizer (PFE). Target was our worst performer in the quarter, primarily driven by customers and public reaction to in-store promotions for the month of June. We believe management has listened to its core customers, made the necessary changes, and avoided structural damage to the brand.”Click to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts Trim Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.Suggested Articles:Wall Street Analysts Are Bullish on These 10 Stocks with Increasing Price Targets20 Worst Performing Economies in 202310 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None.

Although the long-term trend is still bullish, investors should prepare for short-term fluctuations to protect their portfolios. Recent volatility arises primarily from three sources. Fed Reinitiates Interest Rate HikeOn Jul 26, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5.25-5.5%. This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001. Notably, since March 2022, the central bank hiked its interest rate in 10 consecutive FOMC meetings before taking a pause in the June 2023 meeting.It reinitiated the rate hike regime as the inflation rate remained elevated at almost double the Fed’s 2% target rate. In his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said ""The process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."" The central bank remains open to more rate hikes, depending on economic data. Fitch Downgrades U.S. RatingOn Aug 1, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA. The agency cited “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.” In May, Fitch placed the AAA rating of the nation on the negative watchlist.Fitch expects the general government deficit to rise to 6.3% of U.S. GDP in 2023 from 3.7% in 2022. The agency remained concerned about a steady deterioration in the standards of governance over the last 20 years. Notably, in 2011, S&amp;P had downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA.Story continues Moody’s Downgrade Ratings of U.S. BanksOn Aug 8, Moody’s Investors Service cut the rating of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. Moreover, the rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade. Moody’s also changed its rating outlook to negative for 11 banks.According to Moody’s, “U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets.”The rating agency also said “Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate portfolios.”Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, health care and utilities to safeguard one’s portfolio.

However, the company reaffirmed guidance for fiscal 2024.The company reported adjusted earnings of 2 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share. The company recorded earnings of 20 cents a share in the year-ago period.Meanwhile, net revenues of $1,317 million came ahead of the consensus estimate of $1,298 million but fell 2% on a year-over-year basis.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUnder Armour, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteThe company’s wholesale revenues decreased 6% year over year to $742 million, while direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues inched up 4% to $544 million due to a 6% rise in e-commerce revenues, which represented 40% of the total DTC business.

Revenues from the Accessories category inched up 1% to $97.9 million. Meanwhile, Licensing revenues tumbled 10.9% to $25.1 million, driven by softness in the Japanese licensee and North American unit.Net revenues from North America decreased 9.1% to $826.7 million. Meanwhile, revenues from the international business increased 12% (up 15% on a currency-neutral basis) to $485 million.Within the international business, net revenues in EMEA jumped 10.5% to $226.6 million (up 11% at constant currency), 14.5% in Asia-Pacific (up 21% at constant currency), and 12.7% in Latin America (up 5% at constant currency).The company’s gross margin shrunk 60 basis points to 46.1% from the prior-year period due to increased promotions and adverse foreign currency movements, partly offset by supply-chain gains associated with reduced freight expenses. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses dipped 1% to $587 million.The company’s operating income fell to $20.9 million from $34.5 million. The operating margin was 1.6%, down from 2.6% in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesOther Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $703.6 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $594.1 million and total stockholders' equity of $2,005.4 million. The inventory jumped 38% to $1.3 billion.For fiscal 2024, management expects capital expenditures in the range of $250-$270 million.FY24 GuidanceManagement reiterated view for fiscal 2024. For the current fiscal year, Under Armour expects revenues to be flat to slightly up. It expects the gross margin to be up 25-75 basis points, compared with the prior year's margin of 44.9%, backed by supply-chain tailwinds with respect to lower freight costs. The figure is likely to be partly offset by mix impacts stemming from higher off-price revenues and increased promotions in the company's DTC business. SG&amp;A expenses are anticipated to be flat to slightly up.Under Armour expects the operating income to be between $310 million and $330 million versus the comparable baseline period’s operating income of $284 million.UAA expects earnings in the band of 47-51 cents per share, down from 84 cents per share reported in fiscal 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings of 58 cents a share for the comparable baseline period. Capital expenditures are likely to come in the band of $250-$270 million.For the fiscal second quarter, revenues are likely to be flat to down slightly year over year, including a low single-digit fall in the company’s North American business. This will be partly offset by mid-single-digit increase in the international business. In addition, it anticipates the year's highest revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter.Further, the gross margin is likely to grow nearly 100-150 basis points in the second quarter on gains from lower freight costs, somewhat offset by the ongoing promotional activity. It anticipates the third quarter to be the year’s smallest quarterly gross margin improvement on inventory-management efforts.Second-quarter operating income is expected in the bracket of $115-$135 million, translating to 18-21 cents as earnings per share.

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.54%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.17%.Coming into today, shares of the semiconductor maker had lost 2.27% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.35%.Analog Devices will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 23, 2023. On that day, Analog Devices is projected to report earnings of $2.53 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 0.4%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.09 billion, down 0.53% from the year-ago period.ADI's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $10.55 per share and revenue of $12.6 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.24% and +4.85%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Analog Devices should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Analog Devices is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Analog Devices currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.69. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 19.54, so we one might conclude that Analog Devices is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that ADI currently has a PEG ratio of 1.83. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.49 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 174, putting it in the bottom 31% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

We had a strong performance in Q2, beating the high end of our guidance across all metrics. We achieved $123 million in ex-TAC gross profit, $16 million in adjusted EBITDA, and $8 million in free cash flow. We're also excited to raise the midpoint of our full-year 2023 guidance. As we're getting closer to 2024, we're bullish on our future. We expect a step change in our financial performance, and we're reiterating our guidance for 2024 of over $200 million in adjusted EBITDA and over $100 million in free cash flow. Our performance in Q2 was driven by a few things. In our core business, publishers all over the world continue to trust us and sign long-term partnerships, which we saw with new and competitive wins this quarter from Nexstar Media, Barstool Sports, Futura, and more. This is on top of key partners like Time, Disney, Unideditorian, BBC, One India, the print, BancoPoste, renewing their long-term relationship with us. Publishers are demanding less vendors and more true partners as they chart their growth, diversify their revenue, empower their editorial teams, and battle the never-ending changes being thrown at them by the walled garden platform. You see, being an ad provider is just not good enough, and this is where Taboola is unique, addressing all of those objectives in a win-win manner with our publishers. Let me share more about our momentum in Q2. We're outpacing our expectations on e-commerce, which now represents nearly 20% of ex-TAC up from 15% last quarter. I believe e-commerce will continue to be a key part of our business as users are looking to make decisions that matter to them based on information from publishers they trust. There's a lot of growth for us here to capture between publishers looking to launch an e-commerce business, retailers looking for profitable channels, and retail media dollars growing fast, where brands are looking for places to spend and bring clients back to their site. This is not all. We're also outpacing expectations which will use. This is our version of Apple News, which is integrated into Android devices from Samsung, Chaomei, and others. It continues to experience rocket-ship growth and will approach $100 million in revenue this year from over $50 million in 2022. I love that business because first, we built it organically, and it shows that Taboola continues to be a start-up of startup waiting to fund our dreams. And second, this has a high synergy to our core business, as publishers are getting a growing volume of traffic from us at a time when Generative AI is threatening to limit search traffic for publishers. As I look into the rest of 2023, our focus continues to be making our 4 company priorities successful: Yahoo!, performance advertising, e-commerce, and bidding, each representing billions of dollars opportunity for us. Let's take a closer look at how each is progressing. First, let's talk about Yahoo. As a reminder, we're well underway on executing on our 30-year partnership with Yahoo!, which will see us power recommendations under massive footprint of some of the most iconic publishers in the world as well as integrating our data to come up with contextual segments advertisers can use and migrating native advertisers to Taboola technology. We've been developing the technical infrastructure to allow Yahoo!-native advertisers through the Taboola platform as well as tables advertisers on Yahoo!. You will hear me talk a lot about advertisers migration, which is an area we're spending a lot of energy on. There is a huge opportunity for both Yahoo! and Taboola here to bring both companies' advertisers into the mix, make them even more successful and drive yield expansion over time. Some Yahoo! international markets are now live with Taboola. This is part of us testing and evaluating advertisers' performance in preparation for the U.S. market ramping up in 2024. We expect to go into the next phase with Yahoo!, gradually transitioning ad spend and supply to Taboola in the second half of 2023. Let's get into our second priority of the company, performance advertising. One of the things that is special about Taboola, which is similar to Meta and Google, is that the vast majority of our revenue comes from advertisers who buy from Taboola directly using our own AI cold Smart bid. About 10% of our revenues come from programmatic partners such as Google, the Trade Desk, Criteo, Amazon, and others. Our 2 main objectives are to get new advertisers to be successful when they try Taboola and get existing advertisers to stay with us and spend more as measured by net dollar retention. Nearly half of our R&amp;D is working on making advertisers successful. We think there's a huge upside for us and the industry by building the very first must-buy company, enabling advertisers to scale in the open web with Taboola, like they do with Google on Search and Meta for social. Our engineering team is focused on the tech behind our bidding strategies, which is how we can better help new and existing advertisers succeed even more with us using automated algorithmic-based buying methods. I talked in the previous quarter about target CPA, which allows advertisers to set a goal for how much a conversion such as a lead, a purchase, an app install is worse to them and how Taboola would look for users who meet that threshold. We're progressing further here with a new bidding strategy called maximize conversion. It's the default bidding strategy for companies like Google or Meta, and it allows an advertiser to evolve from placing a CPC price per click and sharing their acquisition goal. Put simply, an advertiser can give Taboola a budget and let us try to get as many consumers as we can to convert at the most affordable acquisition price. Then once the advertiser sees how many conversions we can get and at what price, they can establish a target CPA and scale as much as possible with us. This was tested by dozens of advertisers during the second quarter. We've seen encouraging results, and I'm excited to share that NAX conversion as well as target CPA went to general availability this week. I anticipate that more than 50% of our revenue in 2024 will be using maximize conversion, and target CPA as a bidding strategy. Imagine a future where advertisers buying from Taboola don't need to guess a CPC but rather just share their goal, and our AI will do the rest. We're not stopping here. Early 2024, we aim to bring to market the target roast and next revenue bidding strategies. That will take into consideration not only the likelihood for a conversion but also the expected ROI for the advertiser. And lastly, on performance advertising, I'm very excited about our investment in Generative AI. I think it will impact many industries, and we're deeply investing into how it can affect advertisers' success. Brands all over the world have used our technology to generate content and copy for ad creatives such as titles and images. Now the biggest benefits for them have been reducing their time spent on generating ad creative and producing high-performing creative assets for their campaigns. Of the brands using Generative AI technology, 80% run multiple campaigns, and we're seeing brands doubling the clitorate when measured against evergreen campaigns. Now let's go into our third priority, e-commerce. Our investments into growing our e-commerce offerings via technology and through connected and Skimlinks are paying off. I'm happy to report that e-commerce is now nearly 20% of our ex-TAC, and we beat our budget again in the second quarter as we did in Q1. We see outstanding merchant retention and increasing budgets, validating the value clients get when buying from Taboola. Connected is also starting to pick up momentum in Europe, which we're very encouraged by. We previously announced the introduction of Taboola Turnkey Commerce and e-commerce in-a-box solution for publishers, and we've already seen great partners like time and advanced local media adopted. Taboola is doing all of the work for the publishers here. We're using our data to know which content makes sense for us to write on behalf of the publisher. We're driving traffic to those articles. And of course, we're monetizing it with relationships with merchants and service providers. Taboola Turnkey Commerce is meant to connect publishers expertise with consumers to drive monetization, and we're seeing clear signs that it's working. A simple Google search for best checking accounts in 2023 leads consumers directly to Taboola's Turnkey Commerce activation on time.com. It's the first organic result. Consumers in search for this phrase are clearly invested in opening a checking account. And when they arrive at time.com page, they can compare options and make a decision. If and when they click on one of the Times editorial suggestions, both Time and Taboola benefit. Our revenue model here is the same as the rest of our business. Every time revenue is being made, we share it with the publisher. Finally, let's review where we are with our bidder. We estimate that the 8,000-plus publishers in our core business generate display revenue of $20 billion, $25 billion a year. We think we can access our publishers' display inventory with our header bidder solution and win about 5% to 10% of the auction, given our advantage in our AI, first-party data, and technology. This will make us even more valuable partners for our publishers, increasing our share of wallets while providing our advertisers with even more scale. Our strategy here is especially effective as cookies and Chrome are about to be deprecated. And based on our experience with Apple ICP, we anticipate this will be a source of strength for our bidder, given our hard-coated integration on the publisher sites and access to first-party data. We have mainly 2 areas where we bid these days. Microsoft MSN, which launched in April of last year, and our publishers, where we have the first part of data advantage. We believe that as Yalo launches, we'll be able to also partner with them on bidding strategy as well. We're seeing encouraging signs here as well. Microsoft's Q2 of 2023 was higher than Q2 of 2022, and we expect Microsoft's Q3 to be meaningfully bigger than Q3 of 2022. As we said in April last year, we expect it's moving to bidding with Microsoft, who helps us design this product initially, will make our partnership a growing one, and it's happening. In Q2, we doubled down on our efforts and are now live on over 100 sites across our global network of publisher partners. As we continue to scale, we are laser-focused on fine-tuning our technology and algorithms, leveraging our ongoinginvestment in R&amp;D and operations of our bidder platform. Now as I rest my part, I'm bullish about our future and our position in the industry. We're focused on the right tech investments that will continue to fuel our profitable growth as a company and position us as the very first must-buy company in the Open Web for advertisers and partner of choice for publishers for the next many, many decades to drive revenue, engagement, and audience. Personally, I also think Taboola is on the right side of history, driving growth to the Open Web and journalism in a time where advertisers don't have a lot of options outside of search and social. And none of us want their kids to discover things that matter like science or health care or politics on TikTok. The open way is critical. We know what we need to do, and we're executing on it. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to interacting with many of you over the next few weeks. I will now pass it over to Steve, our CFO, to talk more about our financials.Stephen C. WalkerThanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. As Adam noted, our Q2 results beat the high end of our guidance on all metrics. We are also raising the midpoint of our full-year 2023 guidance and reiterating our 2024 expectations of over $200 million in adjusted EBITDA and over $100 million of free cash flow. Let me now talk about our Q2 results, which exceeded the high end of our guidance on all metrics. For Q2, revenues were $332 million versus the midpoint of our guidance of $309 million, gross profit of $97.1 million versus the midpoint of $83 million, ex-TAC gross profit of $123.1 million versus the midpoint of $110 million, adjusted EBITDA of $15.7 million versus the midpoint of $1 million and non-GAAP net loss of $6.4 million versus the midpoint of a loss of $21 million. We generated a positive free cash flow of $7.8 million. I will note that Q1 and Q2 growth rates suffered from difficult comparables in 2022 before the digital advertising market weakness.We expect to return to positive revenue growth in the second half of 2023. Relative to our guidance, we saw overperformance in e-commerce, Taboola News, and in our bidding offerings. E-commerce continues to impress, taking the momentum of the back half of 2022 through the first half of the year. The U.S. business has had strong retention and increasing budgets from advertisers or merchants as we tend to call e-commerce advertisers. In addition, the merchants or advertiser business in Europe has momentum due to our Google PLA campaign management, and there are positive supply-side drivers with new partnerships in the Buy Now Pay Later space. Taboola News will approach $100 million in revenues this year versus over $50 million in revenues in 2022. Finally, our bidding offerings continue to gain momentum. Microsoft is expected to have strong double-digit ex-TAC growth in the second half of 2023, and we have more than doubled the number of other publishers on which we are now bidding. Our teams have achieved this strong revenue and ex-TAC performance while improving cost efficiencies, indicated by our adjusted EBITDA margin in Q2, exceeding the margin that was implied by the midpoint of our Q2 guidance. Operating expenses were $122.1 million in the quarter, down $3.9 million year-over-year. This decrease was primarily the result of our focus on cost reductions that we announced in Q3 of last year. For the full year, we expect to show lower expenses as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in 2023. Our headcount is down approximately 8% from its peak in July of 2022. Our GAAP net loss for the quarter of $31.3 million included amortization of intangibles of $16 million, share-based compensation expenses of $13.9 million, and hold-back compensation expenses related to the Connect acquisition of $2.6 million, which were excluded from non-GAAP net income. Our non-GAAP net loss of approximately $1.4 million was above the high end of our guidance range. In terms of cash generation, we had approximately $11.6 million in operating cash flow in Q2 with free cash flow of around $7.8 million. If you remove the impact of net publisher prepayments, which were a source of cash this quarter of $6.9 million, and interest payments on our long-term debt, which were a use of cash of $4.7 million, our free cash flow would have been $5.6 million. It is interesting to note that net publisher prepayments were a source of cash this quarter. This was due to the fact that new prepayments were lower than the quarterly amortization of historical prepayments. While we still expect net publisher prepayments to be a use of cash in 2023, it does show how they can become neutral to a source of cash in the future. Q2 has historically been a soft quarter in terms of free cash flow. But in Q2 2023, we benefited from our stronger-than-projected operating performance as well as from a net cash benefit from publisher prepayments and some capital expenditures that were deferred from Q2 to Q3. Let's turn to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents plus our short-term investments decreased from $274.4 million at the end of Q1 to $246.9 million at the end of Q2 2023 and remain above our debt principal balance of $203.5 million. The decrease in our cash and cash equivalents balance was driven by the repayment of $30 million of our long-term debt in April. You can see that our net cash balance remains healthy. I also want to update on both the share buyback and debt repayment programs that we announced last quarter. As you probably recall, we announced that we would buy back up to $40 million of shares in 2023 and that we intended to repay up to an additional $50 million of our long-term debt in the second half of the year. The share buyback program was initiated on June 1, and we repurchased a total of approximately 1.4 million shares in the month of June at an average price of $3.02. We continued to repurchase shares in Q3. And as of Friday, August 4, we had repurchased a total of approximately 2.9 million shares at an average share price of $3.17. Note that this includes the shares that we repurchased in June. In addition to the $30 million of our long-term debt that we repaid in Q2, our intention remains to repay up to another $50 million of our long-term debt in 2023, assuming the availability of sufficient working capital. In terms of timing, we expect that this will not occur until Q4 due to the need to access certain cash balances in a tax-efficient manner. Now let me shift to our forward-looking guidance. For the full year 2023, we are raising the midpoint of our guidance. We expect revenues of $1.438 billion to $1.469 billion, gross profit of $420 million to $436 million ex-TAC gross profit of $531 million to $546 million, adjusted EBITDA of $73 million to $80 million, and non-GAAP net income of $5 million to $10 million. Adam mentioned earlier that we are now live in some smaller markets with Yahoo!. Our full-year guidance factors in a small amount of revenue from Yahoo! in those markets. It also factors in the cost of investing in the partnership, so we can capture the full revenue from the partnership. We still expect the revenue to start ramping in the second half of 2023 and to reach full run rate by the middle of 2024. Despite being a year of strategic investment in Yahoo! and in our growth initiatives, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2023 for the full year. we anticipate free cash flow to turn negative in Q3 due to investments related to the Yahoo! partnership with significantly positive cash generation in Q4 due to normal seasonality. Finally, we are issuing Q3 guidance. For Q3 2023, we expect revenues to be between $331 million and $357 million, gross profit between $83 million and $95 million, ex-TAC gross profit of $112 million to $124 million, adjusted EBITDA between negative $2 million and positive $10 million and non-GAAP net income of negative $20 million to negative $8 million. Let me finish by saying that we are happy with our second quarter performance and to be able to raise the midpoint of our guidance for the full year. We are also excited about the step change we are expecting in our business, as reflected by our 2024 targets of at least $200 million of adjusted EBITDA and at least $100 million of free cash flow. Perhaps most importantly, though, we are excited about the momentum we are building in our business, especially the additional scale that Yahoo will bring and the progress we are making toward becoming a must-buy for advertisers looking to reach consumers in the open web. With that, let's open it up to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Andrew Boone from JMP Securities.Andrew M. BooneI wanted to go to the '23 guide. You guys beat 2Q gross profit ex-TAC by $13 million, but are raising the midpoint of 2023 guidance by $6 million. So I guess the question is, is there some incremental weakness or something else you guys are seeing as we're entering 3Q? Or is that just conservatism? And then Adam, great to see the progress in terms of improving yield via tools. Can you talk about MAX conversion and target CPA benefits? And what is that helping to unlock in terms of budgets?Stephen C. WalkerThanks, Andrew. Good to hear from you. So I'll address the first one. So in terms of the full-year guide, we obviously had a big beat in Q2, but we beat the high end of our guidance by $8 million on ex-TAC and almost $10 million on adjusted EBITDA. We want to be conservative, though. So we don't want to count on that level of outperformance kind of continuing throughout the year in Q3 and Q4. Hence, the fact that we kept the high end of our guidance the same while raising obviously, the bottom end lower expectations are off the table at this point. So we raised the lower end. So it's really, as you said, it's conservatism. It's wanting to not count on that level of overperformance throughout the year, even though we're obviously very happy that we did have that level of beat in Q2.Adam SingoldaSo based on the bidding strategy, so just to level set, we -- about half to bus R&amp;D is working on performance advertising. And the reason is that we think there's a huge upside for Taboola to basically make advertisers successful, especially if we want to become the must-buy Open Web company. We now have about 18,000 advertisers. Google has 10 million. So there's a huge range of how much we can capture more advertisers, big and small. But to do that, you have to make it easier for advertisers to be successful when they try to work with you. And then once they're successful, you want to help them spend more and that's more of an MDR kind of dimension. If you look at Taboola over the last many years, we built an amazing business where advertisers bid on Taboola using CPC. So they had to guess what is a click is worth, where by the way they think about their business is how much does the client worth. So if you're -- my wife is a flower shop, so she knows how much a client is worth to her as a business. But if she was to work with the bullish, you would have to guess a CPC. Right now, all she has to do is to say, well, this is how much a client is worth, or here's a $5,000 budget with MAX conversion. You go to Taboola, help me get as many clients as I want, and tell me what is the most affordable price a client could work as it comes from Taboola. This is a beginning of a revolution from my perspective because that means that we can migrate tens of thousands of advertisers over time to work with Taboola, and only focus on their own business objectives, their client acquisition cost, their budget. And so I'm happy to say that we all raised the test at Taboola this week because MAX conversion and target TPA is now general availability. So it's not available to any advertiser, self-service, or enterprise accounts. I suspect Net '24, more than 50% of our revenue, and that's going to be a fairly large amount, especially as Yala is ramping up. We'll be using advanced bidding strategies in AI, such as MAX conversion. The next in line, by the way, after that is MAX revenue and Nextros where advertisers could basically advertisers could tell us. We have more than one product we're selling through Taboola. Here is the price of each one and maximize now turning to conversions, but just make us more money. That is the next in line from a product roadmap. So over time, CPCs will be completely part of our past. So I'm very excited about it, and we're putting half of our tech energy on that.OperatorOur next question comes from James Kopelman from TD Cowen.James McGee KopelmanWith e-commerce outperforming, does this change at all your view of how big a percentage of the overall business e-comm will be once we get past the near-term macro that's created these unusual comps for coordinative advertising? In other words, how should we think about the mix of e-commerce versus core going forward? And is there anything, in particular, you would call out in the second quarter or the third quarter as being kind of the key 1 or 2 drivers of e-commerce growth? And then I have a follow-up for Steve.Adam SingoldaI can start. Feel free to jump in. James, so one, it's really exciting to see e-commerce, something we got into about 2 years ago with the acquisition of Connexity really paying off as it relates to the synergy with our business. We're seeing, on the one side, just great market fit. Advertisers buying from Connected and Skimlinks are getting amazing value. And especially now, when advertisers want to be close to the acquisition, they want distribution to be simple. They want to know that they're putting $1 innate can make more than they spend. This is just a very profitable channel for them. It works. And the more we're adding new advertisers with the bullet sales team, the more we see this business growing. So that's just the fundamental part of that business. On top of that, if you add turnkey, which you may have seen in my letter, I thought a screenshot, we're seeing phenomenal growth essentially -- this is a great one of those, there's more demand and supply. There are more publishers who want Taboola's Turnkey, which means for us to write the e-commerce content for them using our data and then to drive traffic to it, and then monetize it. If you go to time.com stamped, which is the e-commerce website that Taboola and time.com partnered on, it's beautiful. It's ranked at the top of Google search. If you're searching for things like which checking accounts would they open or best smartphones of 2023, we are the top result on search engine, the page, it looks beautiful, and it drives very high yield. To the point that I think over time, this might be even bigger than our core business for publishers as some of them. So this is a great momentum. We're still early on Turnkey, but I think this has a big potential of becoming a big portion of our business over time. I think publishers of e-commerce all want it, and I think it might be 1/3 of your business over time. So the way I think about it is if you're not offering e-commerce to publishers, you may have nothing to offer over time because that's going to be a big portion of what they see as a growth engine.James McGee KopelmanGreat. And then a quick follow-up for Steve. We've been hearing other companies describe somewhat of a stabilization in the digital ad environment over the last couple of months. How would you guys characterize what you're hearing in conversations with advertisers, both in the U.S. and internationally? For example, have you seen any change in video advertising trends, which I think were somewhat soft earlier in the year?Stephen C. WalkerYes. So thanks for the questions, James. So yes, we would say that what we're seeing in the digital advertising environment right now is stability. So in fact, ever since about Q3 last year, we've seen relative stability compared to, obviously, the first -- or the second and third quarter of last year. So we see relatively normal seasonality. We're seeing relative stability of budgets, et cetera. And I think most advertisers that we talk to, what they're basically saying is they're still watching the macro a bit. They're probably getting a bit more bullish, like a lot of people are about the potential for a soft landing and not a recession. But I think they're still cautious but stable. Their spend is stable. They're still spending kind of as they were. Now we are seeing ups and downs in different portions of our business. For instance, e-commerce has been particularly strong, bottom of the funnel, things where you're helping to convert directly into revenue have been particularly strong. Top-of-funnel video still remains soft relative to historical norms. So we haven't seen a further softening of it, but it's definitely soft relative to history. And I think that's consistent with what we've said in the past, which is the further down the funnel you go, the more stability you get and the more strength you get, and the further towards the top of the funnel you are, the softer things are. So generally, that's consistent with what we're seeing. So we've seen pretty much relative stability since the end of Q3 of last year, and nothing has changed dramatically on that.OperatorOur next question comes from Laura Martin from Needham.Laura Anne MartinStaying on the e-commerce spend, Adam, I'm interested in whether you have channel conflict because with the new companies where you're doing content, doesn't that threaten the actual companies that are in your core business where their core business is doing content? Why is this a channel conflict for you guys?Adam SingoldaSo, it's one we're working together. So the editorial team of the publisher works very closely with the editorial team that we've built to create that content. So this is not sort of like a vendorship type of relationship. It's very much a partnership that is deep. And in fact, what I like about it is that I think publishers, in general, want to work with companies that are more partner-type, CPM, and being tech is just part of the path. It's not good enough. So you need to be able to build a relationship that is driven by trust with the editorial team, the subscription team, the audience team, the commerce team. So all of those people on the publisher side take part in deciding who they're going to work with side-by-side to the revenue person. So one, is this is very much a trust-oriented relationship. And two, it's a very different type of riding, right? So when you cover the news or entertainment or things of that nature, it's very different than covering things like products or covering things such as financial services. And also there's a data element of what do users want to read to begin with. So we've been doing this with time.com as an example for almost 6 months now, and it's a huge success. I mean we'll keep expanding how we're promoting that content and the homepage of time.com. Our teams are spending so much time together, I just hope we can do 100x more time.com from my perspective because it's really encouraging beginning.Laura Anne MartinGreat. And then my second one was in your press release. You said that you started to roll out some of the Yahoo inventory offshore, where there's a fewer number of advertisers. Could you talk about -- what -- how is the inventory different in Yahoo? And what are you seeing? What are your early takes on the bigger Yahoo! integration that you've learned for actually rolling out some of these offshore markets so far?Adam SingoldaSure. If you remember, when we announced the Yahoo! 30-year strategic partnership, one of the things that I said is that -- and this was as an out salary because we were not on you at the time, I said, from what we know and what we're talking to an industry executive, working with as an advertiser, it's a huge opportunity because the users are very engaged. It's almost 900 million people a month who love Yahoo, the iconic brand that have been around for 30 years. So between the mail, Yahoo Finance, Sports, News, users are super engaged and advertisers are capturing this engagement in the form of conversions and growth to them.So it's a very loyal advertiser base that love Yahoo, as much as consumers love them. This was then when I talked about it, just by talking to people in the industry and, of course, talking to Yahoo. Now we're live on the international markets. This is a smaller portion of Yahoo, obviously, the U.S. is the bigger portion. But what's really encouraging me and us is that now that we're able to bring some Taboola advertisers onto Yahoo international markets, we've kind of validated this very important assumption that Yahoo is awesome. That is an advertiser spending on Yahoo! is able to get great conversions. And what we hope is that as we're now moving to the next stage, really, the rest of the year, migrating advertisers on both sides and bringing that into one holistic mix, this will be a great opportunity for advertisers on both sides, and we can continue to improve advertiser success, as you know, is our #1 priority as a company. So what we know now is that it's awesome. It's small, but we're very excited to kind of continue to the next stage into the U.S. and ramping that up in 2024.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Dan Day from B. Riley Securities.Dan DaySo just first one for Steve. Just looking at the guidance and backing into the cash operating costs, and I'm thinking about that really is the delta between gross profit and adjusted EBITDA. I think the back half implies around $65 million or so per quarter. That had been more like $55 million a quarter. I understand that's mostly due to the Yahoo! -- integration expenses really starting to hit the income statement. But can you just talk about how much of that incremental OpEx in the next couple of quarters is kind of stickier in nature? And how much of it is sort of onetime in nature.Stephen C. WalkerGood to hear from you, Dan. So you're correct. Almost all of that uptick in the second half comes from 2 areas. One is investment in Yahoo!. So we will be doing the incremental hiring to basically support the ramping of Yahoo! that will, as Adam said, start in the second half and then continue through the middle of next year. Those costs -- so there's 2 types of costs within that. So one is their salespeople and account managers to manage the revenue. Those are permanent. So we will always need those people to manage the revenue coming from the relationship. And in fact, we think we'll be able to grow the relationship over time. So we may even grow the number of headcount that's supporting that as the revenue growth because we typically see that our sales and account management headcount tends to grow roughly in line with revenue. We gained some efficiencies over time, but it grows roughly in line with revenue. So those will be permanent. The tech resources that we'll be bringing on to help with the transition, those will be able to cycle off of the project once we get fully ramped for the most part. There's really nothing that is dramatically special about the Yahoo! setup that will require permanent people on that. So we'll be able to cycle them off. So we'll probably move them to other projects at the end of the ramp, so by the middle of next year. So that gives you an idea on the Yahoo!. The second area that we will be doing some incremental hiring here is actually in e-commerce since it's growing so well. We've identified a number of growth initiatives with e-commerce that we think would benefit from the incremental hiring that would help us grow those faster. So we will be doing some incremental hiring there. I think we have enough initiatives there that those are effectively permanent. I mean we're going to keep them on, they'll start doing new initiatives over time, but they'll be effectively permanent, but they'll obviously come with a step-up in our revenue there. So I hope that helps in terms of understanding kind of the cost base.Dan DayYes. That was great, Steve. Follow-up probably for Adam, you talked about in response to the last question, when can you 100 of these time stamps like deals with Turnkey Commerce. Just maybe talk about the pipeline to get new publishers up and running there. How hard is that like to get this started with new publisher partners? Just generally where you stand in terms of bringing on more partners for the Turnkey Commerce initiative.Adam SingoldaSure. And thanks for the question. So let me start with the demand for the product. So I can tell you, we have a lot of publishers who want to launch it. In fact, there are some publishers who will offer to pay for the service because this is a rev share as a reminder, but just is there any way to get priority to get on the platform, given the success and how -- and people can check it out on their own. They don't even need to ask costs, you just search things, and you see that the results are coming up high. So the demand for the product is -- it's great. It feels like a new iPhone, and everybody wants it, and there's a long line. Where we are in terms of providing that to many, many publishers, we're still -- we want to make sure that we're doing a good job. So we're very focused on our existing partners, Advanced Media, and time.com. There's another big one that we will hopefully be able to share over the next quarter. And we're probably going to focus on those 3 for the rest of 2023, and then 2024, we'll figure out how much we want to expand that. So the good news is that you always want to be in a position where you have more people who want it, then you can give it. And what we're trying to do -- right now is focus on our early adopters. I want to make sure that they're very happy and we're seeing success because that's a priority for us. They took a chance on us, so we want to focus. But we're hopefully moving to more of a scale approach in 2024.OperatorWe'll move to our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.Stephen D. JuOkay. Great. So you've announced some nice publisher wins this quarter. Now understandably, Yahoo! is the one that everybody is focused on right now, but can you talk about what you're hearing from everybody else and when potentially some of the larger publishers may be coming up for RFP?Adam SingoldaSure, Steve. So we -- and I mentioned it a little bit also on my letter. We're investing a lot in technology to make sure that when publishers either think about who to work with or to renew, they get to really take a holistic view about who can help them drive audience growth, engagement growth, and revenue diversification. And it's so great to see that our investments are panning out. So I'll give you one example, homepage for you, which is a way to render, using AI, the entire homepage to personalize it completely to consumers. It's like one homepage turns into 1,000 homepages. And that gets a lot of adoption. It's now -- we have self-service options for networks of sites, and you'll hear a lot more publishers adopting it. So this is -- it's in GA, and it's wildly required by publishers. And this is something that we've been working on alongside Newsroom for 7 years or so. So it's a huge investment. It's a company on its own, and it's something publishers want, as well as helping them get subscription and audience distribution with table news. If you think about generative and the risk of search traffic going down, publishers are asking themselves which partner is going to help me get to more audience. So Taboola is now approaching $100 million in revenue this year. It means that we're just going to continue to spend more and more people to high-quality journalism in the open web. So not only Taboola is the highest or among the highest revenue source, not only we're getting publishers to e-commerce. We're empowering hundreds of editorial staff with homepage personalization. We help them diversify their revenue with subscriptions. All those things in a time of them wanting deep partners. So you're seeing great names like Barstool and Nexstar, which is -- these are huge wins, Geon Media, Express, and more and the same dynamics all over the world. This is a global phenomenon of publishers looking for tech providers that can do those things. Taboola is very special. We invest more in technology than others. So hopefully, we're right that this is where the industry is going. We think we're right. And in terms of others that are in the pipeline, there are great names that are out there that are thinking about who to work with, and I hope to win them all.OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions). I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Adam Singolda for closing remarks.Adam SingoldaThanks, everyone. For joining us today, I'm very excited, as you can tell, about where we are and the momentum we see in our business. We're winning publishers in our core market, thanks to our technology investments, empowering editorial teams, helping publishers get subscribers, launching their e-commerce business, and a lot more. I think publishers want less and less vendors and more strategic partners for 5, for 10, for 30 years. Publishers want companies who invest in technology and can do more than just paying CPM. We're also building our expectations on e-commerce, which is nearly 20% of our ex-TAC, and I believe e-commerce will be a big part of Publishers' revenue in the Open Web. We're building our expectation also on Taboola news, which is our version of Apple News for Android devices with partners like Samsung and Shaomi, and this business is approaching $100 million in revenue this year from $50 million last year. Yahoo is now live on international markets, and we validated it's an amazing place for advertisers to be. Our relationship with Yahoo! leadership is just stronger than ever. And lastly, we expect to grow more than 10% in revenue in the second half of 2023. And in Q4, I expect us to grow more than 20% versus last quarter last year. These are exciting times for us at Taboola and also for the industry. I'm convinced there needs to be a Google-type company dedicated to the open web and journalism that can be a must-buy so advertisers can, for the first time ever rely on that company, and we have a real shot at the bema one. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to many of you over the next few weeks.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

(NYSE:VZ) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/64-ownership-shares-verizon-communications-140023228.html,1691589623,STORY,['VZ'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Verizon Communications implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 39% ownership Recent sales by insiders Every investor in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Verizon Communications. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Verizon Communications does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Verizon Communications' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Verizon Communications is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.3%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Verizon Communications Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$35m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 36% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  Verizon Communications is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

Moreover, IoT has facilitated remote monitoring and troubleshooting of displays which has largely reduced downtime and ensures continuous functionality.Story continuesThe generosity of IoT services is not limited to the healthcare sector. In fact, it has tapped into the unexplored potential in urban transportation. The combination of electric bikes (e-bikes) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a win-win idea as E-bikes offer a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional commuting with addressing issues like traffic and pollution. On the other hand, IoT technology enhances e-bikes by providing real-time tracking, remote diagnostics, and seamless integration with other transport options through apps. This data also helps improve urban planning for better infrastructure and traffic management.Challenges for the Internet of Things to Look Out ForThe biggest challenge that comes with the IoT is the implementation of IoT security in the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. As IoT integrates the physical world with computer-based systems, the attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase and hence, attracts malicious actors. In industrial settings, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is especially critical but harder to secure due to long-standing, hard-to-upgrade components with limited maintenance windows.Existing IoT cybersecurity standards from organizations like NIST and ISA are complex which also makes implementation harder as technical documentation for some security standards runs over thousands of pages. Moreover, harmonizing security for both older ""brownfield"" and new ""greenfield"" systems is equally complicated and complex.Another challenge is that government regulations often lag the rapid evolution of IoT technology which leaves businesses without essential information to make decisions. The absence of robust IoT regulations contributes to its security risks, especially as critical devices like medical equipment and cars become connected.Quality control is challenging due to the influx of IoT devices from countries like China that have varying security standards. Thus, experts advocate for strong and universal security standards to address these concerns, as the potential attack surface expands to include more crucial devices. Moreover, the lack of sufficient regulation can raise eyebrows and lead to potential disaster scenarios in the IoT landscape.Let's now move to the biggest IoT companies in the world.20 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the WorldZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe methodology used to rank the Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the world is based on the annual revenue generated by IoT companies in 2022.

The approximately $8.5 billion (7.7 billion euro) deal puts Tapestry in a better position to do just that in going-to-toe with rivals like LVMH and Kering.Tapestry Inc., whose brands also include Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, said Thursday that the combined company had global annual sales of more than $12 billion (10.9 billion euro) and has a presence in more than 75 countries. Tapestry has a market cap of nearly $10 billion (9.1 billion euro), while Capri's is around $4 billion (3.6 billion euro).Once completed, the new entity will be the fourth largest luxury company in the world, with a combined market share of around 5.1% of the luxury goods market, according to research firm GlobalData PLC. In the Americas, the company will become the second largest luxury player behind LVMH, with a combined share of 6% of the luxury goods market, GlobalData said.“The combination of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman together with Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors creates a new powerful global luxury house,” Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said in a prepared statement.Capri Holdings Ltd. shareholders will receive $57.00 (51.9 euro) per share in cash.""By joining with Tapestry, we will have greater resources and capabilities to accelerate the expansion of our global reach while preserving the unique DNA of our brands,” Capri Chairman and CEO John Idol said.French luxury conglomerate Kering reached a deal in July to buy a 30% stake in Italian fashion house Valentino for 1.7 billion euros from Qatari investment firm Mayhoola. Under the agreement, Kering, which owns Gucci, has the option to buy 100% of Valentino no later than 2028.Story continuesKering had also tried to snap up Tom Ford, but beauty company Estee Lauder wound up reaching a deal with the luxury goods maker.LVMH, meanwhile, purchased famed jewelry company Tiffany in 2021 after a back-and-forth between the two companies over the agreement.Buying Capri is a strategic move for Tapestry on many levels.Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said the acquisition will “create an American fashion giant that, while not quite as prestigious or large as its European counterparts, would wield a significant influence in the luxury market.”“Luxury is facing something of a slowdown, especially in the North American market where consumers, even at the higher income end of the market, are starting to curtail spending,"" Saunders said. “This has put pressure on Tapestry and Capri, both of which are now looking to international markets to bolster growth.”The boards of Tapestry and Capri have approved the deal, which is expected to close next year. It still needs approval from Capri shareholders.Capri's stock jumped 56%, or $19.35 to $53.96 in early morning trading on Thursday, while shares of Tapestry fell almost 12%, or $4.87, to $36.38.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD, Shopify Inc. SHOP, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN and Hut 8 Mining Corp. HUT. Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog: 5 Stocks to Watch as Cryptocurrencies Surge on Banking TurmoilOn Aug 8, cryptocurrencies surged following Moody’s Investors Service’s decision to downgrade the credit ratings of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. Moreover, the rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade. Moody’s also changed its rating outlook to negative for 11 banks.The cryptocurrency market regained its lost glory this year after a highly disappointing 2022. A steady decline in the inflation rate and consequently the Fed’s decision to lower the magnitude of interest rate hike helped cryptocurrencies to regain pace.  A high interest rate is detrimental to growth assets like technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks and cryptocurrencies.However, during the past month, cryptocurrencies were trading rangebound after the Fed’s decision to reinitiate rate hike in July following r a brief pause in the June FOMC meeting and the decision by Fitch Ratings to downgrade the U.S long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA. This resulted in a spike in yields of U.S. sovereign bonds.Finally, on Aug 8, Moody’s decision created a turmoil in the U.S. banking sector acting as a positive surprise to the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are generally recognized as an alternative to the banking sector. In March, cryptocurrencies soared 50-60% following the debacle of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Story continuesOn Aug 8, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Dogecoin and Litecoin advanced 1.9%, 1.5%, 2.1%, 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively. Notably, in the last 14 days, bitcoin was unable to move more than 1% in either direction.Institutional ThrustsThe largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors. BlackRock Inc.’s decision to launch a Bitcoin ETF and the decision of The Charles Schwab-led consortium to create a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets, have attracted several investors toward cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin to name a few.The latest addition to this league is PayPal, which has become the first major U.S. fintech company to offer its own crypto token with a dollar-pegged stablecoin known as PayPal USD.PayPal USD is designed to contribute to the opportunity stablecoins offer for payments and is 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD is redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars and is issued by Paxos Trust Company.Stocks to WatchNVIDIA Corp. is a semiconductor industry giant and one of the biggest success stories of 2023.

Due to the explosion of interest in risky equities such as tech stocks, these emerging players all have great value catalysts ahead of them. Furthermore, the economy is also looking strong with low unemployment. Combining these factors, we see a great backdrop for cheap hydrogen stocks to create new all-time highs.High-interest rates might slow things down. But as we continue to get inflation under control, the Fed will surely take its foot off the gas on rate hikes in the foreseeable future. The implication of falling rates is great for growth stocks, specifically, lower interest rates raise the expected value of its future cash flows. It also makes credit easier to access and obtain, helping to continue the decades-long bull market of the S&amp;P 500.Those are all great reasons to snap up cheap hydrogen stocks now before one misses out. Let’s investigate which are the recommended plays.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAir Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comAir Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) is an American multinational industrial chemicals and gas company that provides critical infrastructure for a variety of industries. As an added bonus, APD stock may also fill a spot in your portfolio if you’d like a company in the industrials sector, too. The benefit is that industrials create a cyclical sector that performs well when the economy hums along.In 2022, they saw strong revenue growth of 23%, while also growing EPS by 7.53% year-over-year. APD has made significant investments in liquified hydrogen for commercial use, including a $475 million (CAD) investment from Canada’s Federal and Provincial Government to build out a robust Hydrogen network in Alberta, Canada.In terms of timing, now might be a good time to buy APD stock. Analysts gave it a $329.14 price target, signaling an appreciable upside. Momentum is also on its side. It trades above its 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages, meaning bulls could stand to benefit for longer.Story continuesBloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) specializes in hydrogen fuel cells, electrolyzers, and microgrid energy solutions. Their solid oxide fuel cell technology has been leveraged across a variety of industries. BE stock is my best short-term contrarian play in the hydrogen industry. Analysts expect it to rise to $26.43 in the coming year.Furthermore, the stock has seen a recent decline, but the upcoming earnings report and the launch of a new product for net zero heating and cooling could influence its future performance. Also, the company expands throughout Europe, particularly by signing a major player in Germany.Under the agreement, 300 kilowatts of Bloom’s solid oxide fuel cells will provide base load power to Geothermie-Gesellschaft Bruchsal GmbH’s geothermal plant in Bruchsal, which supplies heat and electricity and is part of a research project to extract lithium from geothermal water. This news was announced just days ago and is pivotal to give bulls the enthusiasm they need to reach that healthy price target.Plug Power (PLUG)Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is a more high-risk, high-reward play. They have secured a hydrogen supply deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), as well as large-scale hydrogen supply deals in Europe. However, the tradeoff is that PLUG stock burns hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter with no defined path to profitability.It’s not all bad news, however. PLUG stock has a firmly liquid balance sheet, with very little long-term debt on its books. Its current liabilities due in a year also make up a small part of its capital structure. It has a quick ratio of 3.20 and a current ratio of 4.40. If these ratios were worse, there would be a good reason to be worried.Looking ahead, it plans a green hydrogen generation plant at the Port of Antwerp-Bruge, Germany. The company also has partnerships in Europe and Asia and plans to produce more than half of its hydrogen energy from renewable sources by 2024.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But some on Wall Street don't believe it will be so straightforward.""It’s going to be a show-me story,"" Joel Simkins, a managing director in Houlihan Lokey's technology group, said via email.Among analysts' concerns: Competitors FanDuel and DraftKings (DKNG) have already seized large portions of market share in the US and believe they are closing in on profitability. All while Wall Street remains hyper-focused on whether expansive marketing spend can lead to profits after some in the industry have floundered. ""Just because you have a lot of eyeballs watching it doesn't translate to market share automatically,"" Simkins said.Penn is paying ESPN (DIS) $1.5 billion over 10 years and an additional $500 million in PENN stock warrants in exchange for exclusive rights to odds attribution, digital product integrations, and access to ESPN's talent. This means Penn's ""ESPN Bet"" branding and gambling odds will be plastered on the screen during game broadcasts and mentioned by on-air talent throughout shows.For ESPN, the deal offers an opportunity to ""significantly grow engagement with ESPN consumers, particularly young consumers,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said on the company's earnings call Wednesday.If successful, Penn believes the tie-up with ESPN could help bring the struggling online operator additional market share.In June 2023, Penn's then-Barstool-tied sportsbook produced revenue of $1.2 million in Pennsylvania, the largest state where Penn operates mobile sports wagering, representing about 3.5% of the market share. Meanwhile, FanDuel and DraftKings combined have a 72% share of the state, with FanDuel alone owning 49%. Penn has included incentives for ESPN based on how much market share it gains but declined to specify those metrics on the earnings call.Story continues""We're not doing this deal to be a 4% or 5% market share player,"" Snowden said on the call. ""That's not going to be acceptable for us. It's not going to be acceptable for ESPN. So you should assume if those are the ranges you're in, that's not going to work out long-term.""DraftKings and FanDuel haven't relied on broadcast partnerships to gain their market share either. Instead, the two sports betting-focused apps have defined themselves in the market with top-tier technology and the widest array of options.""Issues remain as to the magnitude of share given the later entry, as well as the competitiveness of product advancement, which has been the current success driver rather than eyeballs,"" Jefferies analyst David Katz wrote in a note on Tuesday night.ESPN logo before the VRBO Fiesta Bowl on December 31, 2022, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. (Photo by Kevin Abele/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) (Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)A sour history of media dealsGiven Penn's current place in the market, ESPN spurring increased market share would bring validity to the strategy of partnering with a broadcast network, which hasn't worked often in the past.Sports streamers fuboTV (FUBO), Bally's (BALY), Fox (FOX), and PointsBet have all tried some version of combining exclusive sports broadcasts with their own live odds. All four of those companies have either had their sportsbooks acquired or shut down altogether since.In 2020, PointsBet's inked a $500 million dollar deal with NBC Sports that included exclusive broadcast integrations among other similar features to ESPN and Penn's deal.At the time, PointsBet CEO Johnny Aitken called NBC ""a megaphone for sports"" and noted exclusivity with NBC was ""very valuable."" But the partnership never translated to big market share gains. Fanatics purchased PointsBet for $225 million in June.""They were expected to get double-digit market share gains,"" Macquarie gaming analyst Chad Beynon told Yahoo Finance Live. ""After we saw some of these media deals not work out as expected I think there's been just more questions around if this is the right way to acquire customers, maintain customers, and are you able to hit the goals?""For its part, Penn's deal with ESPN could be more additive than prior deals. ESPN recently added gambling celebrity Pat McAfee to its lineup of talent and owns a wider array of sports rights than any other broadcaster in the US.""It sounds like they do have a lot of control with the personalities, with the content and there will be a board seat from ESPN on Penn's board,"" Beynon said. ""So, it certainly looks like they're tied up as close as they could be.""Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(Photo: Hyliion Holdings)Startup powertrain developer Hyliion Holdings has sufficient cash to run its business through 2024 without raising new capital. But it might sell new shares next year if the conditions are right.With this week’s bankruptcy filing by electric bus and battery maker Proterra Inc., a massive increase in authorized shares sought by Workhorse Group, and fuel cell system maker Hyzon Motors suggesting it was available for sale or merger, survivability of new transportation companies took on new urgency.Unlike those companies, Hyliion is in far better shape. It had $354 million in cash and investments at the end of June.The Austin, Texas-based company reported a second-quarter net loss of $35.2 million, or 19 cents a share. That compared to a loss of $33.5 million, or 19 cents, a year ago. Total revenues were $266,000 compared to $172,000 last year. Hyliion sold a small number of its first product, a hybrid-electric add-on for diesel and natural gas trucks.‘Shifts in the electrification space’“We have seen significant shifts in the electrification space over the past few years that have impacted us and our peers. And we expect that these shifts will continue to impact Hyliion’s business model,” CEO and founder Thomas Healy told analysts on a conference call Wednesday.Hyliion is taking a methodical approach to building its Hypertruck ERX natural gas-electric powertrain for upfitting into Peterbilt Model 579 trucks. Hyliion plans to deliver 30 complete trucks in Q4.A decontented Model 579 chassis is the starting point. Hyliion then upfits its powertrain. The truck returns to Peterbilt’s plant in Denton, Texas, for validation where it gets a VIN before shipping. Eventually, Hyliion expects its powertrain to be available for spec the way a customer chooses between a Paccar or Cummins engine today.The company declined to estimate how many powertrains it will build in 2024. Final orders depend on extended trials at potential customers. Those trials were supposed to start in Q2 but were delayed to the current quarter because of supply issues.Story continuesIt is also waiting for Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board approvals before it can ship trucks. Hyliion received an all-clear from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it complies with federal safety standards.New products, regulatory pressures and higher pricesHyliion originally envisioned its natural gas-fueled generator for making onboard electricity as an alternative to long-haul diesel trucks. Electricity generated from natural gas in urban areas and potentially negative net carbon renewable natural gas on the open highway could propel the Hypertruck 1,000 miles between fill-ups.Now, Hyliion is adding a day cab version because potential customers complain that battery-electric trucks underperform on advertised range. And the charging infrastructure to keep the trucks on the road is lagging.“We see fleets adjusting their electrification strategies as they move along the path to adoption,” Healy said. “We’ve heard from fleets that the additional weight of the Hypertruck ERX sleeper variant will hinder its ability to operate in weighed-out hauling applications.”Regulation also plays into the decision. Hyliion received certification to use the Cummins X12N natural gas-powered engine in California. But the California certification expires in 2024. So, Hyliion is planning to integrate the Cummins X15N natural gas engine. It is available next year. Hyliion plans to integrate it into the Hypertruck ERX by late 2024.Another factor: Cummins is retiring its L9 and X12 legacy engines. The engine maker is replacing them with a new X10 engine capable of powering medium- and heavy-duty trucks on a variety of fuels.Hyliion said that despite increasing parts prices, the sleeper cab version of the Hypertruck will still sell in the high $300,000s — after a $40,000 rebate available under the Inflation Reduction Act. That is close to zero-emission Class 8 battery electric trucks.The day cab is planned for 2025.The Karno equationHyliion thinks it may be able to generate revenue from using Karno generator technology it purchased from General Electric Co. a year ago. It sees 200-kilowatt stationary generators going into demonstration next year with a version for the Hypertruck to follow.“We see it as a prime power application as we anticipate being able to produce electricity for less than the cost of grid power in most locations,” Healy said.Hyliion paid GE $37 million in cash and stock to acquire technology for the 3D-printed generator that can run on a mixture of low-carbon alternative fuels from natural gas to hydrogen and more than a dozen other fuels.Hyliion also has completed integration of a 200kW fuel cell from Hyzon Motors into a Hypertruck. It is running on a test track.The capital questionHyliion won’t raise new capital this year but might test the markets with an equity offering in 2024 if conditions are favorable, CFO Jon Panzer said on the call. It is too soon to predict when Hyliion would reach positive gross margins overall or on any specific product. The first Hypertruck ERXs will be sold at a loss, he said.“We’re not rushing to put out trucks as quickly as we were a year ago or even further back because it’s not necessary to get where we want to be,” Panzer said. “We will continue to sell in 2024, but it’s not a year where the more we get out there the better.”Hyliion (NYSE: HYLN) shares traded intraday Wednesday at $1.52, down 8.42%.Related articles:Hyliion buys 3-D printed, mixed-fuel generator technology from GECummins replaces 2 legacy engines with new X10 powertrainHyliion and Hyzon Motors will collaborate on fuel cell truckClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Hyliion posts scant Q2 revenue but retains cash cushion appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

In the 12 months through July, the CPI is estimated to have climbed 3.3%, after rising 3.0% in the previous month.""I think a higher-than-expected number would produce some short-term equity and bond volatility but I doubt it would change expectations for the peak in Fed rates as there is a weight of evidence pointing to the economy disinflating,"" said Andrew Bell, CEO of Witan Investment Trust.Traders are optimistic the Fed has completed its aggressive interest rate hike campaign, giving 86.5% odds of no rate hike by the central bank in its September policy meeting, according to CME FedWatch Tool.""I'd still expect the S&amp;P to consolidate for a while until the peak in U.S. rates is confirmed,"" Bell added.Initial jobless claims data is also on tap later in the day, along with remarks from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Philadelphia President Patrick Harker.The tech-heavy Nasdaq led Wall Street lower on Wednesday, with heavyweight Nvidia falling 4.7%, followed closely by the other ""Magnificent Seven"" megacap stocks that drove this year's stock rally.Nasdaq has gained about 31% this year on hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy in the face of the Fed's aggressive interest rate hike cycle and optimism over the scope of artificial intelligence.Story continuesRate-sensitive megacap stocks Amazon.com, Microsoft and Apple crept up 0.5% to 0.9% before the bell.At 7:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 172 points, or 0.49%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 23.25 points, or 0.52%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 92 points, or 0.61%.On the earnings front, Walt Disney rose 1.5% after beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly adjusted profit per share.Capri surged 58.3% after larger rival Tapestry said it would buy the Michael Kors parent in an $8.5 billion deal.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts Trim Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.A series of daily 1% changes in the S&amp;P 500, whether it goes up or down, for an entire week might lead to a situation where the strong rise in US stock prices could face substantial challenges. This insight comes from Nomura's cross-asset strategist, Charlie McElligott, who has observed that volatility-control funds have significant stock investments. Due to this high exposure, the possibility of a market decline has increased, especially after a period of calm trading over the past few months, reported Bloomberg. If the S&amp;P 500 experiences consistent 1% fluctuations every day for a week, the potential exists for a significant drop in the ongoing upward trend of US stocks. This heightened risk is tied to the exposure of funds that aim to manage volatility, which are closely tied to stock market movements. The upcoming test will be how the market reacts to US inflation figures, which could increase volatility. On August 10, European stock markets experienced an increase in their values. This growth was supported by luxury brands' positive performance, resulting from China easing certain pandemic-related restrictions. Concurrently, the dollar's value decreased in anticipation of upcoming U.S. inflation data. This data is significant as it could influence the decisions made by the Federal Reserve regarding its policies.According to economists surveyed by Reuters, there's an expectation that consumer price inflation in the United States for July will see a slight uptick to an annual rate of 3.3%. Additionally, the core inflation rate, which excludes the more volatile food and energy sectors, is predicted to increase by 0.2% in July, resulting in an annual gain of 4.8%. History has shown that inflation can persist longer than expected once it becomes high. A former Fed Governor, Richard Clarida, cautions against prematurely declaring success in controlling inflation. The upcoming CPI report is expected to reveal a slowdown in the pace of price increases, but not enough for the Federal Reserve to step back from its efforts to combat inflation. If the Wall Street consensus is accurate, the consumer price index will show a 0.2% monthly increase for July and a 12-month rate of 3.3%. This is notably lower than the 8.5% annual rate reported a year ago. When excluding food and energy, the monthly estimate remains at 0.2%, with a 12-month rate projected at 4.8%. While this seems to be positive news to some extent, various data points suggest that inflationary pressures have considerably eased compared to 2022. Richard Clarida, now an advisor for Pimco, suggests that the Federal Reserve should continue its efforts to combat inflation and avoid premature declarations of success. He emphasized the importance of acknowledging improving data while keeping options open and maintaining the fight against inflation, reported CNBC. Oil prices stabilized on Thursday as investor wariness before U.S. inflation data slightly eased an ongoing price increase due to supply constraints. Brent crude rose by 14 cents to reach $87.69 per barrel as of 0757 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude inched up by 1 cent to $84.5. Oil prices have risen recently due to Saudi Arabia and Russia extending output cuts. Additionally, concerns about supply have emerged due to the possibility of tensions between Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea region, which could jeopardize Russian oil deliveries.Story continuesOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on media and entertainment conglomerate The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), energy stock Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) alongwith biotech firm Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). Check out the complete article to see details of these and other stocks.Wall Street Analysts Trim Price Targets for These 10 StocksSource: pexels10. Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN), a company located in New Haven, Connecticut, is working on creating treatments that break down harmful proteins causing diseases. They use a special platform called PROTAC® Discovery Engine to develop targeted protein breakers. These breakers utilize the body's natural system for removing proteins, helping eliminate disease-causing proteins effectively.On August 9, Piper Sandler made a notable adjustment to the price target of Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN), a company within the spotlight of their analysis. This adjustment entails a decrease in the projected price target, which has been revised from its prior value of $81 to a new target of $70. This modification in the price target signals Piper Sandler's revised assessment of Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN) potential valuation within the market. The decrease of $11 suggests that Piper Sandler's experts have re-evaluated their expectations for Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN) performance, considering various factors that could influence the company's growth trajectory.Just like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), the sentiment is bearish for Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN).09. Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29On August 9, RBC adjusted Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL) price target, reducing it from $27 to $23. This shift reflects heightened competition in the advertising market, according to RBC. Despite the target cut, RBC maintains an ""Outperform"" rating for Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL), suggesting optimism about the company's performance compared to market averages. The change indicates a $4 shift from the previous target and highlights the importance of monitoring market trends for informed investment decisions.Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy made the following comment about Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The most significant detractors from the Portfolio’s relative performance in the quarter included Azenta, Warby Parker, and Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL). Finally, Bumble, a leading online dating app known for its strong, women-centric brand, was another detractor. We do not believe the stock’s poor performance is driven by fundamentals, which have remained strong amidst an uncertain economic backdrop. As one measure of this, the Bumble app recently became the most downloaded dating app in key markets such as the US, Canada, Australia, the UK, and Germany—all without a commensurate increase in marketing spend. We believe the stock was weighed down by fears sparked by the poor performance of competitor Match Group, which is experiencing growth challenges as the Tinder platform matures, as well as a pickup in secondary activity from private equity owner selling. We used this volatility to add to our position in Bumble.”08. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is a company that offers on-demand ridesharing services. Its success is closely connected to the technology industry, and its future depends on how well it can reduce expenses and make operations more effective. This is crucial as the company's stock price has dropped significantly, falling from over $70 to around $10.Stephen Ju, an analyst associated with Credit Suisse, on August 9, upheld his positive ""Outperform"" rating for Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), the ride-hailing company. However, he has opted to revise down the projected price target for Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares. Previously set at $23, the new price target stands at $18, as per Ju's evaluation. This action by Stephen Ju indicates his continued belief in Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) potential to outperform market expectations. Despite the adjustment in the target price, his overall outlook for the company's performance remains optimistic. The revised target signifies a decrease of $5 from the previously anticipated value of $23. This adjustment signals a notable shift in Ju's assessment of Lyft's potential valuation.Similar to how The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) are all experiencing negative sentiment, the outlook is also pessimistic for Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT).07. Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ: LYFT) is a company that offers on-demand ridesharing services. Its success is closely connected to the technology industry, and its future depends on how well it can reduce expenses and make operations more effective. This is crucial as the company's stock price has dropped significantly, falling from over $70 to around $10.Citigroup revised Willis Towers Watson Public Company's price target (NASDAQ:WTW) on August 9, now setting it at $221 instead of the previous $251. Despite this adjustment, Citigroup maintains its stance with a ""neutral"" rating for the company. The decision to lower the price target results from the analysts' careful evaluation of Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) performance and the prevailing conditions within the market. This alteration indicates a reduction of $30 from the previously projected value, which signifies Citigroup's updated perspective on the potential worth of Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) within the market. While the target has been decreased, the decision to keep a ""neutral"" rating suggests a cautious approach on Citigroup's part.06. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46On August 9, Wells Fargo, a notable financial institution, adjusted the target price for Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). This adjustment involves a reduction in the target price, which has been lowered from its previous value of $165 to the new level of $135. Concurrently, Wells Fargo has opted to maintain its assessment of the stock's rating with an ""Equal-weight"" classification. The decision to lower the target price signifies Wells Fargo's updated analysis of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) potential value in the market. This shift in projection by $30 suggests that Wells Fargo's experts have re-evaluated their expectations for the company's performance and market positioning. Despite the decrease in the target price, retaining an ""Equal-weight"" rating suggests a neutral perspective on the stock. This could indicate that Wells Fargo believes Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) performance might align with broader market expectations without significant outperformance or underperformance.Smead Value Fund made the following comment about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Our biggest detractors were Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Warner Brothers (WBD), and Pfizer (PFE). Target was our worst performer in the quarter, primarily driven by customers and public reaction to in-store promotions for the month of June. We believe management has listened to its core customers, made the necessary changes, and avoided structural damage to the brand.”Click to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts Trim Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.Suggested Articles:Wall Street Analysts Are Bullish on These 10 Stocks with Increasing Price Targets20 Worst Performing Economies in 202310 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None.

(Operator Instructions) Please also note today's event is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Alexia Skouras QuadraniGood afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be made available on our website.Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Lansberry, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Kevin, we will be happy to take some of your questions.So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.Robert A. IgerThanks, Alexia, and good afternoon. In the 8 months since I returned, we've undertaken an unprecedented transformation at Disney, and this quarter's earnings reflect some of what we have accomplished.First, the company was completely restructured, restoring creativity to the center of our business. We made important management changes and efficiency improvements to create a more cost-effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations. We aggressively reduced costs across the enterprise, and we're on track to exceed our initial goal of $5.5 billion in savings. And perhaps most importantly, we've improved our DTC operating income by roughly $1 billion in just 3 quarters as we continue to work toward achieving DTC profitability by the end of fiscal 2024.I'm pleased with how much we've gotten done in such a short period of time, but I also know we have a lot more to do. Before I turn the call over to Kevin Lansberry, our Interim CFO, and I'd like to elaborate on the state of our company and the transformative work we are still undertaking.As I've said before, our progress will not always be linear. But despite near-term headwinds, I'm incredibly confident in Disney's long-term trajectory because of the work we've done, the team we have in place and because of Disney's core intellectual property foundation.Moving forward, I believe 3 businesses will drive the greatest growth and value creation over the next 5 years. They are our film studios, our parks business and streaming, all of which are inextricably linked to our brands and franchises.Looking to Disney entertainment studios. We're focused on improving the quality of our films and on better economics, not just reducing the number of titles we release but also the cost per title. And we're maximizing the full impact of our titles by embracing the multiple distribution windows at our disposal, enabling consumers to access their content in multiple ways.For example, Avatar: The Way of Water, which is now the third highest-grossing film of all time, is also on track to be the biggest-ever electronic home video release for Disney domestically. Certain other titles will be sold in the download-to-own window as well.By focusing on big franchises and tentpole films, we're able to generate interest in our existing library. For example, we're seeing tremendous engagement on Disney+ with the previous Guardians of the Galaxy films, the original Avatar and the first 4 Indiana Jones movies. But the value of our Disney entertainment studios and the reason this will be a key growth business for us extends far beyond our library and new releases. What sets Disney apart are the numerous ways we're able to reach consumers with the stories and characters they love, including in our parks and resorts.We'll be opening new Frozen theme lands at Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris as well as the Zootopia theme land at Shanghai Disney Resort. And later down the road, we will be bringing an Avatar experience to Disneyland, reinforcing the unrivaled worldwide appeal of our brands and franchises.Our Parks and Experience segment overall has had an impressive streak and will continue to be a key growth engine for the company, even as we navigate the cycles that come with operating this business. Our Cruise Line in particular showed strong revenue and operating income growth in the third quarter. Current Q4 booked occupancy for our existing fleet of 5 ships is at 98%, and we will be expanding our fleet by adding 2 more ships in fiscal '25 and another in fiscal '26, nearly doubling our worldwide capacity.In addition to our Cruise Line, strong segment results for the quarter were driven by solid performance at our international parks, and we also saw continued strength at Disneyland Resort. Our Asia parks have been doing exceptionally well, reinforcing a clear opportunity for continued growth. Both Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland have experienced stronger-than-expected recoveries from the pandemic. And in Q3, they both grew meaningfully in revenue, operating income and attendance.We saw softer performance at Walt Disney World from the prior year, coming off our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration. Also as post-COVID pent-up demand continues to level off in Florida, local tax data shows evidence of some softening in several major Florida tourism markets. And the strong dollar is expected to continue tamping down international visitation to the state.However, Walt Disney World is still performing well above pre-COVID levels, 21% higher in revenue and 29% higher in operating income compared to fiscal 2019, adjusting for Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. And following a number of recent changes we've implemented, we continue to see positive guest experience ratings in our theme parks, including Walt Disney World and positive indicators for guests looking to book future visits. This includes strong demand for our newly returned annual passes. We're making numerous investments globally to grow our parks business over the next 5 years, and I'm very optimistic about the future of this business over the long term.The third area that will drive growth and value creation for Disney is our direct-to-consumer business. When you consider our path to profitability in streaming, it's important to remember where we started and how we've adapted based on what we've learned. We overachieved with massive subscriber growth for Disney+ out of the gate, and we leaned into a spending level to fuel subscriber growth, which had been the key measure of success for many. All of this happened while we were still determining the right strategies for pricing, marketing, content and specific international market investments.However, since my return, we've reset the whole business around economics designed to deliver significant, sustained profitability. We're prioritizing the strength of our brands and franchises. We're rationalizing the volume of content we make, what we spend and what markets we invest in. We're deploying the technology necessary to both improve the user experience as well as the economics of this business. We're harnessing windowing opportunities, perfecting our pricing and marketing strategies, maximizing our enormous advertising potential, and we're making extensive Hulu content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+.As I announced last quarter, we're moving closer toward a more unified one-app experience domestically to pair high-quality general entertainment with content from our popular brands and franchises for our bundle subscribers. It's a formula for success that we have already proven in international markets with our Star offering on Disney+.We see a future where consumers can access even more of the company's streaming content all in one place, resulting in higher user engagement, lower churn and greater opportunities for advertisers. We're also very optimistic about the long-term advertising potential of this business. Even amid a challenging ad market, this quarter, we began seeing early signs of improvement. And I'm pleased to announce that as of the end of Q3, we've signed up 3.3 million subscribers to our ad-supported Disney+ option. Since its inception, 40% of new Disney+ subscribers are choosing an ad-supported product.On our pricing strategy, this year alone, we've raised prices in nearly 50 countries around the world to better reflect the value of our product offerings, and the impact on churn and retention has outperformed our expectations. Later today, we will release details regarding upcoming streaming price increases. And I'm pleased to share that our ad-supported Disney+ subscription offerings will become available in Canada and in select markets across Europe, beginning November 1, while a new ad-free bundled subscription plan featuring Disney+ and Hulu will be available in the U.S. on September 6.Maintaining access to our content for as broad an audience as possible is top of mind for us, which is why pricing for our stand-alone ad-supported Disney+ and Hulu offerings will remain unchanged. I'd also like to note that we are actively exploring ways to address account sharing and the best options for paying subscribers to share their accounts with friends and family. Later this year, we will begin to update our subscriber agreements with additional terms on our sharing policies, and we will roll out tactics to drive monetization sometime in 2024.Our DTC ambitions also extend to our sports business. Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing.It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition.We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences. Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it.Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process.Looking to our broader linear business. While linear remains highly profitable for Disney today, the trends being fueled by cord cutting are unmistakable. And as I've stated before, we are thinking expansively and considering a variety of strategic options. However, we're fortunate to have an array of extremely productive television studios that we will rely on to continue providing exceptional content for audiences well into the future.And speaking of the content we create, I'd like to say a few words about the ongoing strikes. Nothing is more important to this company than its relationships with the creative community, and that includes actors, writers, animators, directors and producers. I have deep respect and appreciation for all those who are vital to the extraordinary creative engine that drives this company and our industry. And it is my fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months, and I am personally committed to working to achieve this result.In closing, I returned to Disney in November and have agreed to stay on longer because there is more to accomplish before our transformation is complete and because I want to ensure a successful transition for my successor. In spite of a challenging environment in the near term, I'm overwhelmingly bullish about Disney's future for the reasons I shared at the beginning of this call. The work we've done over these past 8 months are core foundation of creative excellence and iconic brands and franchises and because of the unrivaled talent we have at every level here at Disney. I have the highest confidence in our leadership team today, and I'm enormously proud of the ways each of them is helping steer the company through this moment of great change.And with that, I'll turn things over to Kevin.Story continuesKevin LansberryThanks, Bob. It's good to be here. And good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal third quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $1.03, a decrease of $0.06 versus the prior year. In the coming months, we will be presenting recast financials in line with our new reorganized segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN, and Parks Experiences and Products. So today will be the last earnings call where we will discuss our numbers under the existing structure.Now turning to this quarter's results. Starting off with direct-to-consumer. As Bob referenced earlier, we've improved direct-to-consumer operating results by $1 billion in just 3 quarters. For Q3, operating losses improved by approximately $150 million versus the prior quarter and by approximately $550 million versus the prior year. These results outperformed the guidance we gave on the last earnings call largely due to lower-than-expected expenses, including from realizing SG&amp;A savings sooner than initially expected.Disney+ core subscribers grew by nearly 800,000 during the third quarter, in line with the commentary we made at our last earnings call, with international growth more than offsetting modest domestic net losses. As Bob mentioned, our progress will vary from quarter-to-quarter, and we are more focused on overall economics versus pure sub growth. But currently, we do expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see core Disney+ net adds rebound with growth both domestically and internationally.Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.11 driven by higher per subscriber advertising revenue domestically as well as price increases in certain international markets. With over 40% of gross adds opting for the ad tier, the domestic Disney+ ad tier is continuing to improve our ARPU. And we look forward to the additional market launches announced today, which should serve as a stepping stone on our path to profitability.Disney+ Hotstar subscribers declined this quarter as we adjusted our product from one centered around the IPL to one more balanced with other sports and entertainment offerings. I would also note that this business with its significantly lower ARPU compared to core Disney+ is not a material component of our overall D2C financial results. We will therefore continue to focus our commentary on the core Disney+ product.Hulu and ESPN+ subscribers were roughly comparable to Q2. Hulu remained profitable in the third quarter with advertising revenue increasing versus the second quarter, benefiting sequentially from a higher sell-through rate. In Q4, we expect D2C ad revenue to continue to benefit from higher advertiser demand at Hulu as well as from the ramp-up of the Disney+ ad tier.As we work toward achieving D2C profitability by the end of fiscal 2024, we don't necessarily expect the progress to be linear each quarter as the impacts of the transformative work we are doing take time to realize. We expect to see more meaningful improvement in our D2C losses by middle of fiscal 2024. These expectations and plans remain subject to all of the risks and assumptions we previously identified and are noting here today, which will require close and ongoing assessment. But we remain encouraged by the early results we've already realized and are optimistic about our path ahead.Moving on to our content sales line of business. Operating results declined by a little over $200 million versus the prior year. Lower results in the third quarter versus the prior year were due to lower TV/SVOD and theatrical results. For Q4, we expect this business to generate operating losses up to $100 million worse than last year's fourth quarter.And at Linear Networks, operating income declined versus the prior year by $580 million driven by declines at both domestic and international channels. The decrease at domestic channels was driven by lower advertising and affiliate revenue and by higher programming and production costs driven by the NBA and the new Formula One agreement.While domestic linear advertising revenue declined year-over-year, ESPN ad revenue increased by 4%, demonstrating the relative strength of sports. Quarter-to-date, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of the Big Ten this year. It's worth noting, however, that the absence of the Big Ten is expected to drive overall operating income favorability in Q4 versus the prior year. The fourth quarter will also hold 1 additional Monday night football game versus the prior year.Linear advertising continues to see impacts from market softness. While sports is healthy, entertainment continues to face headwinds. Note that we expect D2C advertising year-over-year growth to partially offset linear declines in the fourth quarter.And we wrap this year's upfront with overall volume roughly in line with the prior year. Growth in addressable revenue increased, representing over 40% of the total upfront volume, and sports pricing is up single digits across the board.Domestic Linear Networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year due to a 6-point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 4 points of growth from contractual rate increases. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year driven by lower advertising revenue, and to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.Our Parks, Experiences and Products portfolio of businesses continues to be an earnings and free cash flow growth driver for the company with both revenue and operating income increasing by more than 10% versus the prior year. International parks continued its strong growth trend with year-over-year operating income increasing at all our international sites, but most significantly at Shanghai Disney, which saw record highs from a revenue, OI and margin perspective.At domestic Parks and Experiences, operating income was up 24% versus prepandemic results in fiscal '19, but declined 13% versus the prior year. In addition to the inflationary cost pressures we have discussed on prior calls and some of the near-term headwinds at Walt Disney World that Bob mentioned earlier, results reflect an approximately $100 million accelerated depreciation charge related to the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser. These drivers were partially offset by favorable performance at our Cruise Line and at the Disneyland Resort.While Walt Disney World results were down year-over-year, as Bob mentioned, operating income was nearly 30% higher versus 2019 when adjusting for the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. Domestic parks attendance grew slightly year-over-year, reflecting comparisons against last year's strong trends coming out of the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World. Per cap spending was comparable to the prior year with contributions from pricing, Genie+ and higher food and beverage spend offset by attendance composition changes and lower merchandise spend.Excluding the impact of the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation, domestic Parks and Experiences operating margins in Q3 were roughly 3 percentage points below the prior year, and DPEP margins were slightly higher than the prior year.We continue to expect some moderation in demand at our domestic parks as we compare against our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and the burn-off of pent-up demand persists, while elevated travel costs are impacting international visitation. We are also seeing continued cost pressures in the fourth quarter, predominantly from labor wage rate growth, coupled with $150 million of remaining accelerated depreciation for the Galactic Starcruiser.However, we still expect all-in Q4 operating margins at DPEP to exceed the prior year due to the ongoing strength of recovery at our international parks and Cruise Line. Putting this all together, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation for the Starcruiser, we are still expecting full year total company revenue and segment operating income to grow at a high single-digit percentage rate versus the prior year.We currently expect fiscal 2023 content spend to come in at approximately $27 billion, which is lower than we previously guided due to lower spend on produced content, in part due to the writers' and actors' strikes. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to total $5 billion. This is lower than our prior guide primarily due to spending timing shifts for various projects across the enterprise.In the midst of the transformative work we have been doing, we are prioritizing long-term free cash flow growth and have generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with our single A credit ratings reflecting that strength. We have made significant progress deleveraging coming out of the pandemic, and we continue to approach capital allocation in a disciplined and balanced manner, prioritizing investments to generate future growth while also keeping an eye towards shareholder returns.And to that point, as we've mentioned before, we still expect to be in a position to recommend that the Board declared a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year with the intention to recommend increased shareholder returns over time as our earnings and free cash flow power grows.And with that, I will turn it back over to Alexia for Q&amp;A.Alexia Skouras QuadraniThanks, Kevin. (Operator Instructions)And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.Philip A. CusickBob, the linear business is clearly under pressure, and you made it clear recently that all options are being considered. I'm curious, though, what the practical considerations are of separating assets like ABC, National Geographic or others from both ESPN or sports or integrated or from Hulu, which is kind of the next-generation distribution platform. Can you talk about that? And then second, can we assume that most of those TV assets have been fully depreciated?Robert A. IgerClearly, if we are to do anything significant in terms of, call it, strategic direction to the linear nets, we have to keep in mind the need for content to ultimately fuel our DTC businesses, notably and as you mentioned Hulu. So anything that is to be done would be done with an eye toward maintaining a rich flow of content to fuel our growth business, and that will be streaming.There's obviously complexity as it relates to decoupling the linear nets from ESPN, but nothing that we feel we can't contend with if we were to ultimately create strategic realignment.Kevin LansberryAnd Phil, this is Kevin. With respect to the assets, these have been around for quite a while at this point, and we're not going to comment specifically on where they sit from a depreciation standpoint.OperatorOur next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from BofA.Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich CohenBob, maybe just a follow-up on your prepared remarks and film being core strategic. Can you share with us how you plan to improve the performance and maybe the time frame or create more original content? Just give us more color. And then a follow-up to something you said on DTC and password crackdown, is this a fiscal '24 full year? Like will you be done by the end of the year? And is it on a global basis? How many password sharers do you think there are on your platform?Robert A. IgerSo the second part of your question, Jessica, regarding password sharing, we are -- we already have the technical capability to monitor much of this. And I'm not going to give you a specific number, except to say that it's significant. What we don't know, of course, is as we get to work on this, how much of the password sharing as we basically eliminate it will convert to growth in subs. Obviously, we believe there will be some, but we're not speculating.What we are saying, though, is that in calendar '24, we're going to get at this issue. And so while it is likely you'll see some impact in calendar '24, it's possible that we won't be complete or the work will not be completed within the calendar year. But we certainly have established this as a real priority. And we actually think that there's an opportunity here to help us grow our business.Regarding our studio performance, let's put things in perspective a little bit. The studio has had a tremendous run over the last decade, perhaps the greatest run that any studio has ever had with multiple billion-dollar hits and -- including, by the way, too, that were relatively recent, were one, in particular, Avatar: The Way of Water. And we also had a pretty strong performance with Guardians of the Galaxy 3, which has done, I think, approximately $850 million in global box office.That said, the performance of some of our recent films has definitely been disappointing, and we don't take that lightly. And as you'd expect, we're very focused on improving the quality and the performance of the films that we've got coming up. It's something that I'm working closely with the studio on. I'm personally committed to spending more time and attention on that as well.OperatorOur next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.Benjamin Daniel SwinburneBob, we've -- the press is out with the price increase information for later this year tonight. I'm just wondering now that you've been through one Disney+ price increase here in the U.S. and multiple Hulu and ESPN increases sort of how you're thinking about the pricing power of the product as you go into these even more significant increases and whether you think you can hold your customer base as you raise prices.And obviously, some big news with ESPN Bet. Why now? And why PENN? Can you just talk about your vision or Jimmy's vision for the ESPN product over time that stems from this announcement and other thoughts on ESPN's future?Robert A. IgerBen, as you know, I think as we've said before, we took a pretty significant price increase at Disney+ sometime late in calendar '22. And we really didn't see significant churn or loss of subs because of that, which was actually heartening. It's important to note, though, that the price increase that we've just announced is a price increase for the premium product or the non-advertiser-supported product. We're actually keeping the advertiser-supported product flat in terms of prices. That's being done for a reason.Obviously, as has been noted by Kevin in his remarks, the advertising marketplace for streaming is picking up. It's more healthy than the advertising marketplace for linear television. We believe in the future of advertising on our streaming platforms, both Disney+ and Hulu. And we're obviously trying with our pricing strategy to migrate more subs to the advertiser-supported tier.It also should be noted, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, that a substantial amount of new subscribers to Disney+ are signing up for the ad-supported tier, which suggests that the pricing is working for us in that regard. So we're looking at this very carefully.One thing I think that I should also note is that we grew this business really fast, really before we even understood what our pricing strategy should be or could be. And we're really just getting at, and I'd say in the last 6 months, the pricing strategy that's really aimed at enabling us to improve the bottom line ultimately to turn this into a growth business and as a component of that, obviously, to grow subs.Benjamin Daniel SwinburneAnd on the ESPN?Robert A. IgerOn ESPN bet, you say why now? Well, we've been in discussions with a number of entities over a fairly long period of time. It's something that we've wanted to accomplish, obviously, because we believe there's an opportunity here to significantly grow engagement with ESPN consumers, particularly young consumers.And PENN, why PENN? Because PENN stepped up in a very aggressive way and made an offer to us that was better than any of the competitive offers by far. And we like the fact that PENN is going to use this as a growth engine for their business. And we actually believe and trust in their ability to -- in this partnership to grow their business nicely while we grow ours.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.Michael Brian NathansonBob, I have a few, if you could. One is, given the thinking you've done about the future of Disney, why doesn't it make sense to create 2 Disney companies: one focused on parks, CP, Disney+ and then the studio IP that drives that flywheel, and then one on everything else? So why not make a clean break?And then secondly, on ESPN, you've been talking about partnerships. I wonder if you have a vision for the streaming content vision of ESPN that's different than the linear one we see, perhaps a sports funded with other networks or with lead partnership. So can you just expand on how the product will look differently down the road in streaming than it does now linear one?Robert A. IgerMichael, on the first part, I'm not going to comment on the future structure of the company or the asset makeup of the company. As I've said, we're looking at strategic options both for ESPN and for the Linear Networks, obviously, addressing all the challenges that those businesses are facing. I'm looking forward to reading your thesis on it. Maybe you'll give us some ideas about it, but I'm not going to make any comments about it right now.Regarding the second question and ESPN, the strategic partnerships that we're looking to create and that we're actually in discussions about are aimed at accomplishing a few things: one, content, meaning increasing the content that ESPN offers; and two, possibly, I'll call it distribution and marketing support. And it's possible that we'll be able to do both as -- and this is all being done with an eye toward the inevitability of taking the SPN flagship over the top.So when we look ahead and we see a business that will be a direct -- primarily a direct-to-consumer business, we obviously have an eye toward how much content do we need in order to make that a successful business. That obviously ties to what the pricing model need to be and actually, how much distribution support we need. We benefited greatly from the distribution support in the old business model from cable and satellite.Obviously, when you go DTC, you're kind of doing it on your own or maybe not or maybe there's an opportunity with another entity to help in that regard. So we're basically looking quite expansively. I must say we're extremely encouraged with all the interest that we've had already in this regard. And I think it's safe to assume, as we ultimately turn this into a streaming business, while we have a phenomenal hand right now better than anyone else in terms of the content that ESPN offers that -- we believe that adding more content in under economical circumstances might be a wise thing.OperatorOur next question comes from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo.Steven Lee CahallBob, you said you're now on track to exceed that initial goal of $5.5 billion in cost savings, and DTC came in ahead in the quarter. As you think about the future of this business long term and getting to kind of the price and cost structure that you're aiming for, do you have any expectations for longer-term DTC margins? It just seems like you're meaningfully below where Netflix was at a similar revenue scale. So I'm wondering how you think about that 15% or 20% margin level as that business gets above $20 billion in revenue this year.And then just secondly, as a follow-up, given that you have the Hulu put coming up next year, what are your thoughts on your ability to fund that transaction as we head into that time horizon?Robert A. IgerOur streaming business is still actually very young. In fact, it's not even 4 years old. It launched in November of 2019. And we love to have the margins that Netflix has. They've accomplished those margins, though, over a substantially longer period of time, and they've done so because they figured out how to really carefully balance their investment in programming with their pricing strategy and what they spend in marketing.Because we're new at all of this, we actually have not really achieved the kind of balance we know we need to achieve in terms of cost savings and pricing and money spent on marketing. And of course, all the other things that we're looking at from a technological perspective that grows engagement with our customers, for instance, recommendation engines would be one example of that, that have the ability to improve performance or obviously grow consumption.So I would say that -- and I obviously have to -- I can't emphasize enough the time that we spent and the effort that we spent on managing costs. We've done a tremendous job in a very, very short period of time of exceeding the cost reductions that we said we were going to achieve, and that's obviously a major step in the direction of improving our margins. Pricing, as we've talked about earlier on this call and in our comments, is another way to do that. Password sharing is another way to do that. Getting the technology in place to grow engagement, the advertising side of this business is another.So I'm reasonably optimistic and hopeful that we will be improving our margins in this business significantly over the next few years. But I'm not going to make any further predictions in that except -- the good news is that we know how much work we have to do. We know the work that we have to do as well.Kevin LansberryAnd Steven, I'll answer the question with respect to Hulu put. So the -- I'll remind everyone that the floor to that put is about $9.2 billion. We're very comfortable with our current liquidity position. We've got about $11.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We about $10.5 billion worth of revolving credit facilities and commercial paper. And so we -- and we're going to have plenty of future cash flow to help fund all of this going forward.I would also like to note that from a balance sheet perspective, we've got a strong single A credit rating that reflects the strength that we see in our balance sheet. We made significant progress recently, deleveraging coming out of the pandemic. We're prioritizing free cash flow as a company. And we're being really disciplined and smart about how we go about allocating capital across the company.And last but not least, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we hope to still be in a position -- or we plan to still be in a position at the end of this year to recommend to the Board of Directors that we put a modest dividend out.OperatorOur next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays.Kannan VenkateshwarSo Bob, I mean, on the ESPN side, you've spoken about the need for partners. Could you talk a little bit about the priorities when you look at partners? Is it more in the form of direct capital infusion or maybe some kind of reach on the distribution side when it comes to streaming? What are the objectives you're really solving for?And then, Kevin, maybe as a follow-up to the guidance, just triangulating between some of the segment guidance that you just gave and trends in the first 3 quarters. The full year high single-digit guide in the operation is obviously great. But it will need more acceleration in Q4 than we've seen in the first 3 quarters of OI. So if you could just talk through what the drivers of that acceleration, that would be helpful.Robert A. IgerKannan, we're not necessarily looking for cash infusion when it comes to partners. We're looking for partners that are going to help ESPN successfully transition to a DTC model. And that, as I've said, can come in the form of either content or distribution and marketing support or both.Alexia Skouras QuadraniAnd Kannan, can you repeat your second question, please?Kannan VenkateshwarSo in terms of the guidance for high single-digit OI growth, just triangulating between the trends in the first 3 quarters and some of the segment guidance in the quarter, it seems to imply growth in the fourth quarter will be higher for OI. And so I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that acceleration.Kevin LansberryYes. Kannan, there's very significant growth across our direct-to-consumer business and at our Parks and Experiences business also. So those 2 businesses predominantly are the big growth drivers as you begin to look at relative to the prior year where we're getting that kind of growth.OperatorOur next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs.Brett Joseph FeldmanSo I'm curious how your experience with Disney+ Hotstar shape your view on your long-term international streaming strategy. Are you thinking about maybe exiting those markets or any markets and maybe focusing more on content licensing or partnerships? And is it essential that you reshape that international strategy in any way to meet your long-term profitability objectives?Robert A. IgerWe actually have been looking at multiple markets around the world with an eye toward prioritizing those that are going to help us turn this business into a profitable business. What that basically means is there are some markets that we will invest less in local programming but still maintain the service. There are some markets that we may not have a service at all. And there are others that we'll consider, I'll call it, high-potential markets where we'll invest nicely for local programming, marketing and basically full-service content in those markets.Basically, what I'm saying is not all markets are created equal. And in terms of our march to profitability, one of the ways we believe we're going to do that is by creating priorities internationally.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim.Michael C. MorrisSo on the theme of considering options for Disney, there was an article published recently that speculated that the entire company could be sold to a larger technology company. So Bob, my straightforward question is, do you see a plausible scenario where the entire company would be sold?Maybe a bit more broadly, though, when you think of maximum value of the Disney enterprise, do you think that can be achieved by being more aligned with a single technology partner? Or is that value maximized through partnering with a variety of tech platforms?And if I could just sneak one in on the PENN Gaming announcement. Does it -- will you forego advertising partnerships with all other betting or sports gaming partners? And if so, how much impact will that have in exchange for building value in this partnership?Robert A. IgerI -- Michael, I just am not going to speculate about the potential for Disney to be acquired by any company, whether a technology company or not. Obviously, anyone who want to speculate about these things would have to immediately consider the global regulatory environment. I'll say no more than that. It's just -- it's not something that we obsess about.Kevin LansberryGreat. And then, Michael, with respect to any foregone economics or no longer accepting advertising from other gaming companies, I don't see us in a position where we'll ever be in that situation.Alexia Skouras QuadraniOkay.

As part of ComEd’s $231 million investment in new customer programs geared toward removing barriers to electrification, ComEd today announced a new EV Charging Delivery Rate option to incentivize the buildout of an expanded network of EV charging infrastructure to meet a growing need in the northern Illinois region.Additionally, ComEd and the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus (MMC) announced the expansion of a unique program helping local governments shape plans for EV adoption. The EV Readiness program welcomes 15 new communities to work together to develop policies and programs to safely integrate EVs and EV charging programs in their communities.Together, ComEd’s investments and partnerships to enable the electrification of transportation, buildings and industry will play a key role in addressing the impacts of climate change and enhancing air quality for all communities and advance the goals of the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which sets a goal of putting 1 million EVs on Illinois roads by 2030.""ComEd is committed to helping more residential and business customers transition to zero emissions technologies needed to build a cleaner, more resilient future for all,"" said ComEd CEO Gil C. Quiniones. ""Working in collaboration with state, municipal and regional partners, ComEd is offering new programs to help remove barriers to going electric at home, on the road and at work – with a special focus on underserved communities that have been hit hardest by carbon emissions.""Story continuesEVs are on the rise in Illinois, with nearly 70,000 registered with the state today, and more being registered every month. The development of adequate EV charging infrastructure is essential to supporting customers in making the transition to an EV and reducing range anxiety. Thousands more chargers will be needed in the years ahead to support new state goals for expanding EVs, with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimating between 18,000-36,000 additional fast charging stations needed statewide.NEW COMMERCIAL RATE OPTIONTo accelerate investment in charging infrastructure, ComEd is now offering an EV Charging Delivery Rate option. This new rate option is available to all nonresidential customers with EV charging and provides them with a cost-effective alternative to demand-based delivery rates. This will help business customers that are expected to have low charger utilization in the near term as the electrification efforts continue to grow in northern Illinois. All nonresidential customers are eligible, including: public sector, businesses, mass transit agencies, and other commercial categories.""As we move towards developing a new fueling infrastructure for the state – the utility role will only become more critical. ComEd’s new rate options will complement the state’s investment in charging infrastructure and help create an expansive public charging network in Illinois,"" said Megha Lakhchaura, State of Illinois EV Officer. ""We hope to see continued initiatives from ComEd that align with the state’s attempts to accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles and fight climate change.""""To date, ChargePoint has helped our customers in Illinois deploy thousands of public and private charging stations — and these new programs will allow us to expedite that work in the coming years,"" said Matthew Deal, Senior Manager of Regulatory Policy, ChargePoint. ""ComEd’s programs will lower the cost of operating EV charging stations while helping finance the actual deployment of this critical infrastructure.""The transition to electric technologies, including EVs, offers customers a way to lower their carbon footprint while at the same enhancing air quality across our communities. ComEd’s new investments in electrification are projected to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by over 400,000 metric tons over the life of the plan, the equivalent of the amount of carbon sequestered by approximately 500,000 acres of U.S. forests in one year.""This plan is clear evidence ComEd listened carefully and got the message loud and clear, communities like ours and towns and villages across Illinois need help if we expect to accelerate the transition to beneficial electrification and meet the state’s climate change goals,"" said Billy Davis, Co-Founder, General Manager, JitneyEV, LLC. ""These customer-focused programs and incentives go a long way to helping us get there.""Additional customer programs to incentivize and accelerate the adoption of EVs and other electrified technologies will be rolled out in coming months as part of ComEd’s three-year, $231 million investment. These programs, which include new rebates, make-ready infrastructure support, and pilot studies, are designed to support a transition to cleaner technologies and were informed by feedback gathered last year from hundreds of participants representing communities, health advocacy, industry, local business, school districts and other customer groups across the service region.""Commercial EV rates and make-ready programs are both market accelerants for transportation electrification,"" said Sara Rafalson, SVP of Market Development, Public Policy, and External affairs for EVgo. ""Through the Beneficial Electrification Plan, ComEd has laid the foundation to rapidly grow third-party investments in public charging. We look forward to growing our fast charging footprint in ComEd's service territory over the coming years to serve EV drivers across Chicagoland and Northern Illinois.""EV READINESS PROGRAM FOR GOVERNMENTSComEd and MMC today also announced its continued investment in the EV Readiness program, a collaboration with the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus, launched to help local governments prepare to meet the growing demand for EVs and EV charging infrastructure. ComEd’s renewed support for the program will also serve a second cohort of communities set to participate in the program, announced today. These include:BataviaBensenvilleBerwynDuPage CountyElginEvanstonHickory HillsHighland ParkMontgomeryNorthbrookPark ForestPeotoneRiver ForestWilmetteWoodstock""ComEd’s investments in electrification have been essential as community leaders move to reach new climate goals, navigate funding opportunities, and adopt local policies that will make EV integration safe and equitable for the residents and businesses they serve,"" said Kevin Burns, Metropolitan Mayors Caucus Environment Committee and Energy Subcommittee Chairman. ""We are thrilled to welcome a second cohort of communities committed to achieving EV readiness through this program, and thank ComEd for its continued partnership in helping communities meet new demand for EV access, and the environmental benefits that comes with it.""The EV Readiness program kicked off last year, working with a diverse cohort of 16 communities to support safe and effective plans for regional transportation electrification. In addition to developing local plans, participation in the program has also helped position communities for competitive funding opportunities designed to support electrification.ComEd’s investments to support EV adoption align with its proposals filed with regulators earlier this year to enable the power grid to support the increasing number of EVs and solar resources while ensuring continued resiliency in the face of more severe and frequent weather events. ComEd’s proposed plans will build on ComEd’s record-setting reliability performance, ensuring the benefits of the clean energy transformation in Illinois are shared equitably by ComEd customers, while balancing affordability.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

For the current fiscal year, Under Armour expects revenues to be flat to slightly up. It expects the gross margin to be up 25-75 basis points, compared with the prior year's margin of 44.9%, backed by supply-chain tailwinds with respect to lower freight costs. The figure is likely to be partly offset by mix impacts stemming from higher off-price revenues and increased promotions in the company's DTC business. SG&amp;A expenses are anticipated to be flat to slightly up.Under Armour expects the operating income to be between $310 million and $330 million versus the comparable baseline period’s operating income of $284 million.UAA expects earnings in the band of 47-51 cents per share, down from 84 cents per share reported in fiscal 2023.

Capital expenditures are likely to come in the band of $250-$270 million.For the fiscal second quarter, revenues are likely to be flat to down slightly year over year, including a low single-digit fall in the company’s North American business. This will be partly offset by mid-single-digit increase in the international business. In addition, it anticipates the year's highest revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter.Further, the gross margin is likely to grow nearly 100-150 basis points in the second quarter on gains from lower freight costs, somewhat offset by the ongoing promotional activity.

It provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to the GF Value calculation, Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's current price of $103.75 per share and a market cap of $15.80 billion suggest that the stock's long-term return is likely to be higher than its business growth, given its relative undervaluation.Akamai Technologies (AKAM): A Modestly Undervalued Stock Worth ConsideringLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Akamai Technologies has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.23, which is worse than 86.23% of companies in the Software industry. However, with an overall financial strength rank of 6 out of 10, Akamai Technologies' financial strength is deemed fair.Story continuesAkamai Technologies (AKAM): A Modestly Undervalued Stock Worth ConsideringProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent long-term profitability, is less risky.

The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Akamai Technologies is 8.6%, which ranks better than 51.45% of companies in the Software industry. But its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 8.2%, which ranks worse than 52.19% of companies in the Software industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another way to assess its profitability. For the past 12 months, Akamai Technologies' ROIC is 8.14, while its WACC is 8.35.Akamai Technologies (AKAM): A Modestly Undervalued Stock Worth ConsideringConclusionIn conclusion, Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) appears to be modestly undervalued.

Brent hit a six-month high on Wednesday, while WTI touched its strongest level since November 2022.U.S. CPI data awaitedSentiment was largely strained ahead of key U.S. consumer price index data due later in the day.Markets were on edge as analysts forecast a potentially stronger reading for July, which could indicate that inflation remained sticky and well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% annual target range.High inflation is expected to provide more impetus to the Fed to maintain its hawkish stance- a scenario that could weigh on economic activity in the remainder of the year, potentially hurting oil demand.The prospect of higher-for-longer rates also boosted the dollar in recent weeks. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for international buyers.Tighter supplies, robust U.S. fuel demand underpin oil pricesWhile data released on Wednesday showed U.S. inventories unexpectedly grew in the week to August 4, it also showed a much bigger-than-expected draw in gasoline and distillate stockpiles.The reading showed that fuel demand in the world’s largest fuel consumer remained robust despite higher interest rates and inflation.The reading also spurred hopes that global oil markets will tighten further in the coming months, following extended supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia.Story continuesChinese demand recovery in question after weak dataA slew of weak economic readings from China drove up concerns over a demand recovery in the world’s largest oil importer. China’s oil imports also sank to their second-lowest level this year in July, as a post-COVID economic recovery ran out of steam.But Beijing is now expected to roll out more stimulus measures in the coming months, which could help push up economic activity and oil demand in the country.Related ArticlesOil prices edge lower from 2023 highs, U.S. inflation awaitedGold at 1-mth low, copper steadies ahead of U.S. CPITexas power use hits another record during heat wave]"

It was the first substantial gasoline consumption in five weeks, after a similar reduction of almost 2.6M during the week to July 1. The forecast was for a draw of 0.008M. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the decline came in at 1.706M barrels for last week versus the prior week’s draw of 0.796M.It was the largest weekly draw in distillates since the week ended May 5.

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Avantax shares have lost about 3.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.2%.What's Next for Avantax?While Avantax has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Avantax: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

With Compute Cloud@Customer, customers can develop, deploy, secure, and manage workloads using the same software stack as OCI in deployments as small as a single rack.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer enables organizations to run applications and middleware on OCI compute, storage, and networking services with flexible virtual machine (VM) shapes in their data centers. When combined with Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer, it is the ideal platform for workloads that are tightly integrated with Oracle databases. Organizations can use the same OCI services in their data centers and Oracle Cloud Regions, while developers and IT managers can use the same APIs and management tools to deliver a consistent user experience everywhere. Organizations can also consolidate existing workloads and deploy new cloud-native applications on a fully managed cloud platform in their data centers, enabling them to capitalize on OCI's cost-effective consumption model to streamline operations and reduce costs.""Users want a consistent experience regardless of where services are running, and that is why we continue to invest in our distributed cloud strategy with the launch of Compute Cloud@Customer,"" said Edward Screven, chief corporate architect, Oracle. ""Oracle provides a choice of OCI public cloud regions, Dedicated Region, and Cloud@Customer platforms that customers can combine to create a globally distributed cloud solution. This choice makes it easy for customers to achieve their strategic cloud business objectives while enabling them to address data residency requirements and to access high-performance connections to existing data center and latency-sensitive applications.""Story continuesArchitected for high performance and high availability, Compute Cloud@Customer can be easily expanded to meet the needs of small and large organizations, each with a different distributed cloud deployment scenario. Starting with 552 processor cores and 150 TB of usable storage (block, file, and/or object), Compute Cloud@Customer can scale compute and storage independently to more than 6,000 processor cores and 3.4 PB of storage capacity.Unlike on-premises offerings from other public cloud providers that are assembled from third-party components or have very limited capabilities, Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer is a completely integrated cloud platform—built, installed, owned, and managed by Oracle. It is entirely compatible with the OCI public cloud regions and OCI Dedicated Region and delivers the same core OCI cloud services, at the same low pricing. These capabilities reduce the burden of maintenance and upgrades for customers while enabling customers to develop and run cloud native applications anywhere.""For organizations looking to deploy cloud services on-premises, the message is 'go big or go home',"" said Ron Westfall, research director, The Futurum Group. ""So many on-premises cloud services are either warmed-over hardware boxes gift wrapped with financial engineering tools or I see them offering one-tenth the capabilities of their public cloud counterparts. Oracle's latest Compute Cloud@Customer offering clearly bucks this trend and delivers the same compute, storage, networking, APIs, control plane and a growing list of services that are also available in OCI. It's part of the company's strategic distributed cloud strategy and as such is a full-blown cloud experience on-premises—not a 'litmus test' like other cloud vendors are peddling.""As with all OCI services, data on Compute Cloud@Customer is always encrypted to improve security, while the OCI Console enables organizations to control data locality, replication, and backups fully. This enables organizations to meet demanding data residency and privacy requirements. Additionally, organizations using OCI-based authorization and authentication can add Compute Cloud@Customer as a resource into an OCI tenancy, creating a single, unified environment that spans on-premises and OCI Region data centers.OCI's Distributed Cloud Strategy Brings Services Where Customers Need ThemOracle Compute Cloud@Customer is the latest addition to Oracle's distributed cloud offerings, including Oracle Alloy, OCI public cloud regions, Oracle E.U. Sovereign Cloud, Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure, OCI Dedicated Region, and Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer. OCI's deployment options include the functionality of all 100+ OCI services, or just a subset, with customer-specified location, performance, security, compliance, and operational models. Organizations use Oracle distributed cloud's standard services, management, and user experiences to deploy the same software anywhere they need to run.Additional ResourcesHear from Edward Screven to learn more about running OCI Compute anywhereRead the technical blog for details on Compute Cloud@Customer configurationsRead additional analyst commentaryLearn more about Oracle Cloud@CustomerAbout OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised the conference is being recorded.Hosting tonight's call are Mr. Ted Fernandez, Chairman and CEO; and Mr. Rob Ramirez, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Ramirez, you may begin.Robert A. RamirezThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and.Thank you for joining us to discuss The Hackett Group second quarter results. Speaking on the call today and here to answer your questions are Ted Fernandez, Chairman and CEO of The Hackett Group; and myself, Rob Ramirez, Chief Financial Officer.A press announcement was released over the wires at 4:15 PM Eastern Time. For a copy of the release, please visit our website at www.thehackettgroup.com. We will also place any additional financial or statistical data discussed on this call that is not contained in the release on the Investor Relations page of our website.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that in the following comments and in the Q&amp;A session, we will be making statements about expected future results, which may be forward-looking statements for the purposes of the federal securities laws. These statements relate to our current expectations, estimates and projections, and are not a guarantee of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, and which may not be accurate. Actual results may vary. These forward-looking statements should be considered only in conjunction with the detailed information, particularly the risk factors that is contained in our SEC filings.At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Ted.Story continuesTed A. FernandezThank you, Rob, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call. As we normally do, I will open the call with some overview comments on the quarter; I will then turn it back over to Rob to comment on the detailed operating results, cash flow, as well as comment on outlook; we will then review our market and strategy-related comments, after which we will open it up to Q&amp;A.Before I move to our quarterly results, let me start by mentioning our 2022 results, and the [comps] they will provide to our 2023 performance. In 2022, we had a very strong first half of the year with operating results exceeding our guidance in Q1 and Q2 by at least $0.03 in each quarter of the prior year. By the middle of the year, the impact of interest rate increases started to disrupt economic growth, which has resulted in extended client decision-making.Relative to the second quarter, this afternoon we reported revenue before reimbursements of $75.6 million, which was above the high end of our guidance and adjusted earnings per share of $0.39, which was at the high end of our guidance. Although economic volatility [is up], so is the demand for our digital transformation solutions, which clients require to remain competitive and drive productivity improvement.Consistent with our comments on our previous earnings call, significant first quarter [end] sales resulted in an 8% sequential revenue growth in the second quarter. This has allowed us to exceed the results from Q2 of last year. This was most pronounced in the swift turnaround of our Oracle Solutions segment. Our total company quarterly results continue to be driven by our Global Strategy and Business Transformation segment, which was up sequentially but down slightly on a reported basis when compared to last year's strong comp. Our recurring, higher margin Research Advisory and IPaaS offering, sales grew sequentially, and we expect strong sequential sales growth in Q3. If this momentum continues and we are able to close a couple of IPaaS pilots, we should be able to achieve an annual contract value growth of 20% in 2023.In Q2, we published our Customer-to-Cash Receivables Market Intelligence Report. In the third quarter, we intend to publish 2 additional market intelligence reports: first up, we will analyze and compare the purchase-to-pay software companies such as Coupa, SAP, Arriba, and Oracle; the second market intelligence report which evaluates service providers in finance and accounting outsourcing will include companies such as Accenture, IBM, and TCS. What makes our market intelligence report [essential] is the unique approach to assess companies for both differentiated capabilities and measurable value delivered on our Hackett Value Matrix. Our unique insight is our ability to measure value realized through automation and service improvements that enhance customers' business performance. Our next 1, Enterprise Performance Management is a 3-part reports that will include specialized analysis of planning and budgeting, enterprise consolidation, plus an aggregate view of total enterprise performance management. By early 2024, we intend to issue 6 additional evaluations of software and services providers.Our market intelligence reports represent critical value to our providers -- to the providers, the companies learn how they compare to competitors' strengths and opportunities, as well as the measurable impact their solutions deliver. Our conclusions, which are depicted in our Hackett Value Matrix to help providers to market and sell their solutions through licensing and the use of Hackett digital tools. We also advise how providers can adapt their solutions to perform better. Providers aren't the only ones to benefit. A large benchmarking and consulting and executive advisory customer base can apply the market intelligence report to inform software and services purchase decisions.All of these enhancements are critical to the launch of our new member platform Hackett Connect. This new state-of-the-art platform will allow all of our existing and as well as new members to avail themselves to the proprietary benchmarking metrics as practices and research, which is based on applied knowledge and proven implementation expertise delivered by practitioners, which highly differentiates our insight and expert advice. We are also building a community of users that can benefit from one another that we believe will result in a powerful expert network. This is 1 of our organization's most significant transformative efforts.The Oracle Solutions segment was up strongly on a sequential basis as expected this quarter. We started several engagements, which we [saw] as we completed the first quarter and continue to experience strong market demand and received strong support from the Oracle sales channel. Our SAP Solutions segment continued its momentum with higher-than-expected software sales activity.The investments we have made to fully digitize our IP and the development of our digital platforms, which include Quantum Leap, our state-of-the-art global benchmarking platform, and our proprietary Hackett Digital Transformation Platform or DTP are paying off. These platforms are allowing us to highly differentiate all of our offerings and also develop new licensing and research relationships with software and service providers across the enterprise. The launch of our Hackett Connect platform provides members access to the IP and tools of these 2 platforms and also significantly improves their ability to engage with our experts and shortly our community of users in an ever-improving way.On the balance sheet side, you can expect us to use our cash flow from operations to accelerate the paydown of our outstanding credit facility throughout the balance of the year. Longer-term, we want to be more aggressive with our balance sheet by using our current credit facility to fund acquisitions and buyback stock while continuing to invest in our business.With that said, let me ask Rob to provide details on our operating results, cash flow, and also comment on outlook. I will make additional comments on strategy and market following Rob's comments. Rob?Robert A. RamirezThank you, Ted. As I typically do during this portion of the call, I'll cover the following topics: an overview of our 2023 second quarter results along with an overview of related key operating statistics; an overview of our cash flow activities during the quarter, and I will then conclude with a discussion on our financial outlook for the third quarter of 2023. For purposes of this call, I will comment separately regarding the revenues of our global S&amp;BT segment, our Oracle Solutions segment, our SAP Solutions segment, and the total company. Our global S&amp;BT segment includes the results of our North America and international IP-as-a-Service offerings, our research advisory programs, our benchmarking services, our business transformation, and our OneStream offerings. Our Oracle Solutions and our SAP Solutions segments include the results of our Oracle and SAP offerings, respectively. Please note that we will be referencing both total revenues and revenue before reimbursements in our discussion. Reimbursable expenses are primarily project travel-related expenses passed through to our clients that have no associated impact to our profitability.During our call today, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provides useful information to investors. We've included reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release filed earlier today and we'll post any additional information based on the discussions from this call to the Investor Relations page of the company's website.For the second quarter of 2023, our total revenue was $77.1 million. Our revenues before reimbursements were $75.6 million, which was above the high end of our quarterly guidance. The second quarter reimbursable expense ratio on revenue before reimbursements was 1.9% as compared to 2% in the prior quarter and 1.6% when compared to the same period in the prior year.Total revenues from our global S&amp;BT segment was $43.6 million for the second quarter of 2023. Revenues before reimbursements for our global S&amp;BT segment was $43 million for the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of 2.4% when compared to the same period in the prior year. This was consistent with guidance as extended client decision-making impacted business transformation engagements. Additionally, the comparisons were against accelerated post-COVID demand we experienced throughout the first half of the prior year. Total revenues from our Oracle Solutions segment was $20.8 million for the second quarter of 2023. Revenues before reimbursements for our Oracle Solutions segment was $20.3 million for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 3.8% when compared to the same period in the prior year, as well as a sequential increase of 21.6%.The momentum we discussed when we provided guidance last quarter continued to accelerate and drove earlier-than-expected second quarter year-over-year revenue growth and strong sequential growth. Total revenues from our SAP Solutions segment was $12.7 million for the second quarter of 2023 and also exceeded expectations due to the sale of a number of cloud license deals. Revenues before reimbursements for our SAP Solutions segment was $12.4 million for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 10.7% when compared to the same period in the prior year. Approximately 22% of our total company revenues before reimbursements consist of recurring multiyear and subscription-based revenues, which includes our research advisory, IP-as-a-Service, multiyear benchmarks and application managed services contracts.Total company adjusted cost of sales, which exclude reimbursable expenses and noncash stock-based compensation expense, totaled $43.8 million or 57.9% of revenues before reimbursements in the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $43.2 million or 57.8% of revenues before reimbursements in the prior year. Total company consultant headcount was 1,148 at the end of the second quarter as compared to total company consultant headcount of 1,128 in the previous quarter and 1,125 at the end of the second quarter of 2022. Total company adjusted gross margin on revenues before reimbursements, which excludes reimbursable expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, was 42.1% in the second quarter of 2023 as compared to 42.2% in the prior year period.Adjusted SG&amp;A which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense and intangible asset amortization was $16.3 million or 21.5% of revenues before reimbursements in the second quarter of 2023. This is compared to $14.8 million or 19.7% of revenues before reimbursements in the prior year. The year-over-year absolute dollar increase is primarily due to incremental investments we're making in dedicated sales resources for our benchmarking, executive advisory, market intelligence, and our IP-as-a-Service offerings. These investments approximated $0.03 in the second quarter of 2023.Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes noncash stock-based compensation expense, was $16.4 million or 21.6% of revenues before reimbursements in the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $17.6 million or 23.6% of revenues before reimbursements in the prior year. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2023 totaled $8.7 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.32 and compares to GAAP net income of $10.2 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.32 in the second quarter of the prior year.Adjusted net income, which excludes noncash stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization for the second quarter of 2023 totaled $10.8 million or adjusted diluted net income per common share of $0.39, which was at the high end of our earnings guidance range. The second quarter of 2023 results were negatively impacted by $0.01 due to unfavorable movements in foreign currency. This compares to adjusted net income of $12.1 million or adjusted diluted net income per common share of $0.38 in the second quarter of the prior year.The company's cash balances were $15.8 million at the end of the second quarter as compared to $16.9 million at the end of the previous quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $7.7 million, primarily driven by net income adjusted for non-cash activity and increases in accrued expenses, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable. Our days sales outstanding at the end of the quarter was 68 days as compared to 66 days at the end of the previous quarter. This increase in DSO is primarily due to slightly unfavorable terms on large client engagements that we've [done] during the first half of the year.During the quarter, we repurchased 6,000 shares of the company's stock from employees to satisfy income tax withholding triggered by the vesting of restricted shares for an average of $19 per share at a total cost of approximately $119,000. Our remaining stock repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter was $13.9 million. During the quarter, the company paid down $5 million on our credit facility. The balance of the company's total debt outstanding at the end of the second quarter was $53 million. Our plan is to further accelerate debt paydowns through the balance of the year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $921,000. At its most recent meeting subsequent to quarter end, the company's Board of Directors declared the third quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share for its shareholders of record on September 22, 2023, to be paid on October 6, 2023.I'll now move to our guidance for the third quarter. The company estimates total revenues before reimbursements for the third quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $72.8 million to $74.3 million. We expect global S&amp;BT segment revenue before reimbursements to be up when compared to the prior year. We expect Oracle Solutions segment revenue before reimbursements to be up strongly when compared to the prior year. We expect SAP Solutions segment revenue before reimbursements to be down on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to expected decreases in cloud license sales. We estimate adjusted diluted net income per common share in the third quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.41, which assumes a GAAP effective tax rate on adjusted earnings of 27.5%.As Ted mentioned last quarter, the third quarter will reflect the continued incremental dedicated investments we are making in program development, adding dedicated sales resources for our benchmarking, executive advisory, market intelligence, and our IP-as-a-Service offerings. These incremental costs are expected to impact our diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.04. We expect adjusted gross margin on revenues before reimbursements to be approximately 43% to 44%. We expect adjusted SG&amp;A and interest expense to be approximately $16.7 million. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA on revenues before reimbursements to be in the range of approximately 23% to 24%. Lastly, we expect cash flow from operations to be up on a sequential basis.At this point, I would like to turn it back over to Ted to review our market outlook and strategic priorities for the coming months.Ted A. FernandezThank you, Rob. As we look forward, let me share our thoughts on the near- and long-term demand environment and the growth opportunity it offers our organization. As I repeatedly say, the demand for digital transformation is being impacted by extended decision-making as organizations asset competing priorities created by the increasing interest rates and the demand disruption which it is intended to affect. However, it continues to be a clear strategic priority for our clients. Digital innovation and enterprise cloud applications, analytics and artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure and workflow automation are dramatically influencing the way businesses compete and deliver their services. Digital transformation is redefining all activities at an accelerated pace, forcing organizations to fundamentally change and adopt these new capabilities to remain competitive and to realize targeted productivity gains.As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, we believe clients [choose] the year-end planning process and the beginning of the 2023 year to assess their industry risk, make headcount and spend reductions, and rebalance their spend with productivity and strategic cost reduction efforts, which are also core to our offerings. We believe that clients will become more comfortable with the economic headwinds, and we will see their behavior improved throughout the year. Similar to us, many of our clients did not experience the demand disruption until late in Q2 of last year and will be more challenged by the strong year-over-year -- or have been more challenged by the strong year-over-year comparisons of the first half of the year. However, most will face more favorable comps in the second half of the year. If we are correct, this will further support the behavior improvement which we expect when we look at the second half when compared to the first half of 2023.On the talent side, competition for experienced executives continues. Overall, we saw turnover continue to moderate during the quarter and expect the trend to continue. Longer term, we have transitioned to a hybrid sales and delivery model, which provides us with effective access to our clients and their respective teams. This hybrid model provides our associates with greater personal flexibility to perform their defined responsibilities remotely, which is very valuable to them. This should allow us and is allowing us to attract and retain talent that we have struggled to retain because of the demanding historical travel requirements of our industry.Strategically, we are accelerating our focus on recurring high-margin IP-related services by increasing the development of new programs, those which we detailed on the market intelligence comments I made previously, and aggressively adding to our sales and marketing resources dedicated to this area. The investment will decrease our Q3 results by $0.04. Additionally on the CapEx side, we will continue our investment on our new Hackett Connect member platform and plan to introduce generative AI functionality in 2024.It is also important to note that we continue to see strong downstream revenues from our benchmarking and research advisory clients through our business transformation and Oracle OneStream and Coupa Consulting Services. This halo effect has been in excess of 40% over the last several years. Simply put, organizations who rely on our IP, research, and benchmarking services are more likely to utilize our consulting services.We are also exploring strategic partnerships which will allow us to syndicate our IPs through new channels and that will allow us to reach beyond the Global 1000 focus in an efficient manner. We launched our first syndication agreement of our IP and content on April 1. We continue to evaluate new channels for our IP in our platforms. We also continue to redefine our global benchmarking leadership through enhancements in Quantum Leap, our digital benchmark software-as-a-service solution, along with our digital transformation platforms. This platform -- these platforms allow us to deliver more information with significantly less client effort. It also allows our clients to leverage our IP to create compelling benefit case assessments, accelerate process flow and software configuration decisions, and track the value realization of the transformation initiatives over the life of their respective effort. We believe that there are no comparable IP-led platforms in the market. As I have mentioned on previous calls, we have a 20-minute demo on our Investor Relations page of our website, so that investors can become more familiar with the capabilities of our platform.Lastly, even though we believe that we have the client base and offerings to grow our business, we continue to look for acquisitions and alliances that strategically leverage our IP and adds scope, scale, and capability, which can accelerate our growth. As always, let me close by congratulating our associates on our performance and by thanking them for their tireless efforts and always [urge] them to stay highly focused on our clients and our people, no matter what challenges we may encounter.That'll conclude my comments. Let me turn it over to our operator and let us move on to the Q&amp;A section of our call. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Martin with ROTH MKM.Jeffrey Michael MartinTed, you mentioned generative AI, a product launch in 2024.

FernandezWell, we're looking at both -- 2 things on gen AI: first, our ability to advise clients on exactly what use cases they can benefit from sooner rather than later. So we're doing an exhaustive assessment of all of our business process areas, which total 130 as we define the enterprise. And looking beyond that into activities to see exactly where the specific gen AI capabilities can actually advantage them soon. That's 1 way of making sure that they can start prioritizing their initiatives.On our end, we're looking at different ways to try to create our own large language model with or without a partner. We're considering both. But we like the idea of being able to engage clients significantly more efficient than we are today. An example that -- for example, we reviewed this morning is a concept around the idea of Hackett. We know individuals consistently want to be able to engage in content more efficiently without ever really even going to [a strict] to a click on either some mobile device or some type of laptop.So we're looking at what kind of training, what kind of data, obviously, we know the data that we have, but what training we will provide our data so that again, the idea is, can we provide our clients and our members with the powerful IP of Hackett by simply posing a question, as an example, and getting some detailed information to whatever is on their mind at any given point of the day and as they're considering some of their strategic or productivity initiatives. But those would be 2 examples, both on the client side and 1 on how we're thinking about deploying our capability and driving that to our client base more aggressively in 2024.Jeffrey Michael MartinGreat. And then wanted to ask what kind of reaction you're getting from the initial market intelligence launch? And what do you think the sales cycle in that might be? And what timing of engagements you might start to expect? And then finally, what would be considered an average contract size related to market intelligence?Ted A. FernandezWell, first, as I've said on the call, the actual published report was our C2C side we're publishing, procure-to-pay software assessment here in the next week or so. And we'll follow that up with finance and accounting outsourcing and hope to get that out before the end of the third quarter. So we're still trying to first put out a number of these as quickly as we possibly can.The engagement, both on the participation side and post, has been favorable. The important thing for us is to really complete the programs that we do want to go out in this, if you want to call it, first tranche, to make sure that everyone, both participants as well as clients, know exactly how we're weighing in and both the influence that we have and the insight that we can provide that is valuable to them, so that's really where we see the benefit coming.To be more specific, when I think of meaningful monetization of all those programs, both in terms of [numbers] and engagement, we would like to see that start materializing in the beginning of 2024 just like we would like to see the impact of the significant sales resource investments that we've been making to increase the number of our sales executive within our IP service ranks to have, what we hope is, a meaningful impact in the middle of 2024.If, as I said on my call, if we see the sequential growth from the sales that we're currently expecting improve as strongly as we expect from Q2 to Q3, we saw a good improvement from Q1 to Q2. We expect stronger sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3. If that cadence continues, then you will see the impact on market intelligence programs, both on the rollout and the sales of them, as well as the impact of just the sales resources across all of our executive advisory programs, which are already in place.Jeffrey Michael MartinGreat. And then you mentioned $0.04 impact in Q3 from the investments and program development and sales personnel or sales resources. What might we expect in Q4? I know it was a $0.03 impact in Q2. That's up to $0.04 in Q3. What do you think it might look like in Q4?Ted A. FernandezWe would expect it to be similar. We have no reason to expect it to be any different. We thought it was going to be $0.04 in Q2, but it actually ended up being $0.03 and that's just when the resources came in and impacted the quarter. We're seeing that roll into the next quarter. We know what that spend is expected to be, so we would expect it to be $0.04. I have no reason to believe that it won't be $0.04 in Q4.Jeffrey Michael MartinGreat. And then in terms of the headcount addition on the consultant side, what areas are you adding more aggressively than others?Ted A. FernandezWell, it's hard to ignore this incredible performance and performance that we're getting from our Oracle Solutions group. So even though we went through that volatility at year-end, since that latter part of Q1, we've been aggressively hiring, both onshore and offshore, resources to handle the kind of demand that we've been experiencing. So that would be the primary area. And then I'm going to say, the second largest area is the hiring of all these additional sales resources. Those will be the 2 primary hiring areas in both Q2 and continue into Q3.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Vincent Colicchio with Barrington Research.Vincent Alexander ColicchioYes. Rob, on GS&amp;BT and Oracle Solutions, I didn't hear in your prepared remarks the growth outlook for Q3. Could you repeat that, please?Robert A. RamirezSure. What we said was that S&amp;BT would be up, Oracle would be up strongly, and that SAP would be down.Vincent Alexander ColicchioAnd that's year-over-year?Robert A. RamirezThat's year-over-year.Vincent Alexander ColicchioOkay. Ted, the $0.02 cost less than expected, was that because hiring salespeople was taking longer than expected?Ted A. FernandezYes, we had some changes, but yes, some of the resources came in later in the quarter.Vincent Alexander ColicchioAre you finding the right people you need, at least, folks from companies that are already doing research type of work?Ted A. FernandezYes, yes, we're finding them, and we find their interest in what we're trying to do to be extremely high. We don't expect that to change.Vincent Alexander ColicchioOkay. And I know you've said you expect that you're looking for meaningful revenue from the market intelligence programs early next year. Is it too early to ask? And the first programs were launched in December of last year. Has revenue come in with plan or is it just too early for that to even be meaningful?Ted A. FernandezToo early since the C2C program published just I think about 5 weeks ago, so too early. But no reason -- remember, the biggest productivity measurement we are making is the productivity of the salespeople that are coming onboard and how that's progressing. And as I've said, we saw improvement from Q1 to Q2, and we expect strong improvement from Q2 to Q3, just based on the activity that they are experiencing. So that speaks to -- the most important is that we have existing programs and then we're trying to increase the number of programs that we saw on a member or subscription basis to our market intelligence programs. So in essence, more than doubling the number of programs that we have. But the primary productivity is that of the sales force with the existing programs, which we have in place, which are significant for the number of salespeople that we have. But yes, what are we trying to do? As you've heard me say to investors, when we started 2022, our goal had been to quadruple the sales force and double the programs that we had in place, or as [close thereof] by the end of 2023. And we're still trying to achieve that.Vincent Alexander ColicchioAnd how many salespeople do you have now and how many do you plan to have by year-end?Ted A. FernandezIn this group that we brought onboard, it's around 30 and counting.Vincent Alexander ColicchioOkay. And 1 last 1 for me. The strength in Oracle Solutions, are there any particularly large deals there, or is it balanced in terms of the business you're ramping now and also in the pipeline?Ted A. FernandezBoth. We've seen both the number of deals we closed peppered with some very significant deals, some from some previous clients, significant clients of ours that have come back to us for Oracle support and help, as they've implemented -- as they needed that kind of assistance. And we're seeing brand new clients walk in the door as a result of, I think, what I would call, excellent collaboration we've been getting with the Oracle sales channel.OperatorAt this time, I show no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Fernandez.Ted A. FernandezWell, thank everyone for participating in our second quarter's earnings call. And we look forward to updating everyone when we report the third quarter. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.]"

We have also covered interesting discussions on different IoT applications. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the World. As of 2022, the global Internet of Things (IoT) market was valued at around $544 billion. It's also estimated to grow significantly in the coming years, with projections indicating it will reach approximately $662 billion in 2023 and a whopping $3.35 trillion by 2030. This impressive growth is expected to result in a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.1% during the forecast period.Many big players in the industry, like Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Siemens AG, have been providing IoT platforms and solutions from deployment services to smart city initiatives and industrial edge solutions. These technologies enable the interconnection of devices using different communication technologies that offer valuable interoperable information without human intervention. If we are to speak about the biggest IoT products in the market, smart watches, smart refrigerators, medical sensors, and fitness trackers would all make it to the list. To read more about the impact of digitalization and artificial intelligence, you should check out our article on Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.How is IoT Making Waves in Industries?IoT has become a pertinent game changer in the healthcare industry by transforming surgical display technology. Through interconnected devices, IoT-enabled surgical displays can integrate data from various medical sources that can provide surgeons with a comprehensive view during medical procedures. Not only does real-time data sharing foster collaboration among medical professionals, it has also added to the quality of patient care and decision-making. Moreover, IoT has facilitated remote monitoring and troubleshooting of displays which has largely reduced downtime and ensures continuous functionality.Story continuesThe generosity of IoT services is not limited to the healthcare sector. In fact, it has tapped into the unexplored potential in urban transportation. The combination of electric bikes (e-bikes) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a win-win idea as E-bikes offer a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional commuting with addressing issues like traffic and pollution. On the other hand, IoT technology enhances e-bikes by providing real-time tracking, remote diagnostics, and seamless integration with other transport options through apps. This data also helps improve urban planning for better infrastructure and traffic management.Challenges for the Internet of Things to Look Out ForThe biggest challenge that comes with the IoT is the implementation of IoT security in the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. As IoT integrates the physical world with computer-based systems, the attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase and hence, attracts malicious actors. In industrial settings, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is especially critical but harder to secure due to long-standing, hard-to-upgrade components with limited maintenance windows.Existing IoT cybersecurity standards from organizations like NIST and ISA are complex which also makes implementation harder as technical documentation for some security standards runs over thousands of pages. Moreover, harmonizing security for both older ""brownfield"" and new ""greenfield"" systems is equally complicated and complex.Another challenge is that government regulations often lag the rapid evolution of IoT technology which leaves businesses without essential information to make decisions. The absence of robust IoT regulations contributes to its security risks, especially as critical devices like medical equipment and cars become connected.Quality control is challenging due to the influx of IoT devices from countries like China that have varying security standards. Thus, experts advocate for strong and universal security standards to address these concerns, as the potential attack surface expands to include more crucial devices. Moreover, the lack of sufficient regulation can raise eyebrows and lead to potential disaster scenarios in the IoT landscape.Let's now move to the biggest IoT companies in the world.20 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the WorldZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe methodology used to rank the Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the world is based on the annual revenue generated by IoT companies in 2022.

Major semiconductor manufacturers such as Micron (MU), Intel (INTC), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), have made large investments in the U.S., but so far labor shortages and construction issues have delayed operations. Aaron Chatterji, Duke University Professor of Business and Public Policy, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the CHIPS Act and the state of the U.S. semiconductor industry.Chatterji, who is also the Fmr. White House CHIPS Coordinator and Fmr. Acting Deputy Director of the National Economic Council in the Biden Administration, remains positive about the effectiveness of the CHIPS Act. With over 460 companies interested in using CHIP subsidies, Chatterji broke down what makes the best candidate for funding. Chatterji said, ""When you're thinking about companies ... at the top of that list is American national security. We are investing in chips to make sure our supply chains are more resilient so we will not have to depend as much on other countries.""Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, it has been one year to the day since President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. The law intends to rebuild the US semiconductor industry with $231 billion in new investment. So let's kind of get a status report. Quite a few major semiconductor manufacturers have made large investments in the US. But so far, labor shortages and construction issues have delayed operations.Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, has been pushing back the opening of its Phoenix, Arizona factory by a year. The world's biggest chip maker was supposed to start production of chips for iPhones and MacBooks in the new facility next year, but now it looks like the doors will not open until 2025.Joining us now with insight into the future of the program Aaron Chatterjee known as Ronnie, former White House CHIPS coordinator. He is now back at Duke University as professor of business and public policy. Thank you so much for being here.Story continuesWe have been watching the fruits of the CHIPS Act very avidly here around the country with all these plans for factories. But it has been sort of a tough road here, in part because of labor to build and staff those factories, Ronnie. So how are you sort of thinking about it status wise and where we are right now?AARON CHATTERJEE: Well, thanks for having me. I feel really good about where we're at today on the one year anniversary of the CHIPS and Science Act signing. I was there when President Biden signed the bill and he said, ""Today is a day for builders."" And we've been building all around the country, $166 billion of private sector investment in the chips industry since we passed the bill. So things are in great shape from that vantage point.There's a lot of interest from the companies in the program. So you're seeing those investments, that's just private sector investment before the money's been handed out. And so now you're seeing over 400 companies, 460 by today's count, that have filed statements of interest to access the CHIPS funding.So I'm confident that money is going to go out, we're going to have announcements before the end of the year, and you're going to continue to see those projects move forward. The chip business is a cyclical business, and it's up and down. But over the long run, I think we're going to see a tremendous increase in production of chips here in the United States of America.BRAD SMITH: Hey, Ronnie. People who are watching are trying to figure out for the sake of their portfolio, what makes businesses a good candidate or a company the best candidate to get the most amount of funding for a project and how that goes about being evaluated.AARON CHATTERJEE: Sure. I mean, when you do a big program like this to invest in a key sector of the economy, you've got to be clear about what your goals and criteria are. Already, there's more applications than there is money. And so when you're thinking about companies, you should look at a strategy report that the CHIPS office released in February that outlined the criteria for the program and how they're going to make decisions.And I'll say at the top of that list is American national security. We are investing in chips to make sure our supply chains are more resilient so we will not have to depend as much on other countries, particularly when they're geographically concentrated in particular parts of the world. And so companies that fulfill those national security objectives are going to be the ones that are going to do really well in the program. That's the number one criteria.There's a list of other criteria in the strategy report that was released in February by the CHIPS program office, that commerce department. A key thing we emphasized during the time I was there is we had to be clear about our goals. We cannot do everything for everyone. We need to be very focused and concise in those things. And you can look at that report for more details.JULIE HYMAN: Have any of the applicants, particularly the large companies, been sort of chafing at any of those restrictions that are being put in place, the sort of limits or conditions that have been attached to getting this money?AARON CHATTERJEE: In conversations with me, they did not chafe at those. I think the issues that you cited earlier about we need to make sure we have the best workforce ready to go on day one to make these factories productive. That's the big issue for a lot of companies that we're working with. I think when it comes to sort of the restrictions on investments around the world, providing benefits and childcare for their employees, these are things that I didn't hear a lot about.And in fact, I think the proof is in the pudding when you think about the 460 statements of interest. That's 460 projects that sort of people in the private sector have said, we'd like to access CHIPS funding. So to me, that's this proof as much as you can have that the program is working as designed, and you're seeing that interest as a result.BRAD SMITH: Are those companies then barred-- by taking some of the CHIPS funding, are they barred from doing mass business with other parts of the world, and notably areas where there have been restrictions put in place special for intellectual property?AARON CHATTERJEE: There'll be guardrails for recipients of the CHIPS funding or those who use the investment tax credit with regards to building up leading edge capability, for example, in particular parts of the world. And we need to make sure that as a US government, we're not using our taxpayer dollars to subsidize sort of capabilities in other countries that are going to threaten our national security. And so those are reasonable rules of the road that will be in place for the recipients of CHIPS money, and it's something that I think is really important for the program and a widely shared value across the board.JULIE HYMAN: So the administration has recently talked about major progress coming in the months ahead on the CHIPS Act and the recipients. What does that look like? What does major progress look like in the next, say, six months?AARON CHATTERJEE: Fantastic. So what you're seeing now is private sector investment around the country. You're seeing factories being built, construction ongoing. These are private sector investments that really have been sort of supported by the signal of passing the CHIPS Act in the first place. But the money for those projects hasn't yet been granted.So what people should expect before the end of the year is major announcements about deals that could happen in the economy to support those kinds of constructions around the United States. So you're already seeing fantastic private sector investment. Some of that's because people are bullish all the United States of America.A lot of it's also because they feel like this is the place to build chips in the future because of the CHIPS Act. You'll see announcements between now and the end of the year about those deals going forward. And that's what you want to look for, and that's what the CHIPS office has been working on for the last year.BRAD SMITH: Are we able to yet quantify what success would look like though?AARON CHATTERJEE: Success will mean that we increase US national security by building more leading edge chip capability here in the United States. We should also be reproducing memory and mature semiconductors at scale. Those will be decisions that are made in the chess program that will be indicators of success.When you look at our capability both on the leading edge, logic, and memory, as well as some of the complementary activities like advanced packaging, research and development, that will be an indicator if we build an infrastructure here that we're successful. We've clearly outlined this, released it to the public. And people can keep score by looking at the investments that the CHIPS office is making and how it aligns with the objectives we set out.That was something that was really important from the beginning. A lot of times when government's making these large investments in the economy, you don't have those rules of the road, people can't keep score, and in the end, those projects don't go well. We have a clear criteria and a way for people to hold us accountable.JULIE HYMAN: Ronnie, finally I want to ask you about, on a related note, the report in ""The Wall Street Journal"" today that the US is preparing to ban private equity and VC investment in some Chinese tech companies. Of course, this is just the latest in the sort of back and forth that we've seen between the US and China. Is this the right way to approach trade and our economic partnership with China?AARON CHATTERJEE: Well, I won't get ahead of the White House actually announcing those details because I don't want to comment on the press report yet.JULIE HYMAN: Ronnie, you don't work there anymore. You can say whatever you want.AARON CHATTERJEE: No, that's right. But I will say, so in my opinion, though, I mean, you look at global trade, and you look at the investments that are happening around the world, both in the chip industry and beyond, and I think that you're not necessarily seeing this big retrenchment from the global economy. What you're seeing is reasonable rules of the road being set out.It doesn't make sense for us to be subsidizing investments that are going to increase capabilities in other countries that could threaten US national security. And so I think to the extent that these rules are making sure that doesn't happen, that's a good thing. We do have to make sure that global commerce can continue, and investments can be made.And that will benefit the United States in the end of the day. When you look at those 460 statements of interest from companies, when you look at the $166 billion of investment, that's coming from US companies and foreign companies betting all the United States of America. We got to keep that system going, but we need reasonable rules of the road to make sure that we're not creating the capabilities in other places that threaten our national security. That's what it's about.BRAD SMITH: Ronnie, great to have you here with us today. And thanks so much for the time really breaking down some of what is key to making this CHIPS Act be successful here as well as much more around the industry. Aaron Ronnie Chatterjee, former White House CHIPS coordinator and Duke University professor of business and public policy. Thanks so much.AARON CHATTERJEE: Thank you for having me. Appreciate it.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely.]"

(NASDAQ:HAS) will pay a dividend of $0.70 on the 15th of November. This means the annual payment is 4.2% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Hasbro Hasbro Doesn't Earn Enough To Cover Its PaymentsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Hasbro isn't generating any profits, and it is paying out a very high proportion of the cash it is earning. This makes us feel that the dividend will be hard to maintain.Earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we could see the payout ratio reach 125%, which is on the unsustainable side.historic-dividendHasbro Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.44 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 6.9% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Over the past five years, it looks as though Hasbro's EPS has declined at around 7.3% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Hasbro that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fas-food industry, see Top 5 Countries With the Most McDonald’s Restaurants. Fast food chains originating in the United States have taken over the world in the past few decades. Most of us are aware of fast food restaurant chains such as McDonald’s and KFC, no matter what part of the world we live in. Such fast-food restaurants have been non-selective in their expansion. They have laid their foundation everywhere, from the United States to Western Europe, and Middle East Asia. American fast-food chains have dominated the European fast-food market. Nine out of ten key players in the European Fast food markets are American brands. At the same time, the presence of European fast-food restaurants in the United States is non-existent. Fast food became popular in the United States because of the highway systems that were developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Americans started traveling more which meant that they needed a quick fix for their hunger. Fast food restaurants gave them fulfilling, budget-friendly, and quick meal options. The concept of fast food is as American as it gets. America is the largest consumer of fast food. The taste is suitable for all sorts of people. It does not have risky flavor and spices. Fast food restaurants prepare and serve food within minutes, suiting the busy lifestyle of most Americans. Most fast food restaurants also deliver food to the home. Fast food restaurant companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) have established themselves in the American markets. So, it is very difficult for new restaurants from around the world to break through in the US. While it is difficult for new players around the world to break into the US market and get a sizeable market share, the growth and size of the US fast food market attract many startups to the US. One such example is Operation Falafel, a Dubai-based startup chain that is trying to break into the United States.Story continuesMcDonald’s is arguably the most popular fast-food restaurant in the world. It is present all over the world and is one of the leading fast food brands in the United States, which also tops our list of the countries with most McDonald’s restaurants. The first McDonald’s was opened in San Bernardino, California, in 1940. Since then, Mcdonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) has not looked back. Today, you can find Mcdonald's in all states of the United States and 120 countries around the world. If you want to find out about the top 3 countries with the most McDonald’s, we suggest you keep reading. Unsurprisingly, the United States accounts for 38% of total McDonald’s restaurants in the top 20 countries with the most McDonald’s.McDonald’s started as a drive-in restaurant. Its success was owed to its assembly line process, which enabled it to serve fast food within minutes. Franchising helped Mcdonald's expand to the entire world. Since 1955, McDonald’s has been a franchising company, and its franchisee played a major role in its success. While Mcdonald's has ruled the fast food market all over the world, it faces competition from other American brands. Subway has now taken over Mcdonald's in terms of total restaurants all over the world. However, Subway’s revenue of $15.2 Billion last year is less than McDonald’s $24 Billion. Top 20 countries With the Most McDonald's Restaurants saknakorn / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology For accuracy, we relied on the official McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) report. It listed all McDonald’s restaurants around the world by year-end 2022. We also took 2022 year-end population figures of the top 20 countries with the most McDonald’s, to calculate people per McDonald’s outlet.20 - MalaysiaNumber of outlets - 341People per outlet - 99526McDonald’s opened its first branch in Malaysia on Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur in 1982. After eight years of opening in Malaysia, it opened its first-ever drive-through restaurant in the country. Since Malaysia is a Muslim country, McDonald’s serves halal food. The menu is catered to the local taste, and pork is omitted from it. 19 - South AfricaNumber of outlets - 346People per outlet - 173104Mcdonald's is available in all of the nine provinces of South Africa. It entered the South African market in November 1995. Initially, McDonald’s faced tough competition from fast food brands in South Africa. However, it has 13% of the market share by revenue today. This makes McDonald’s the second-largest fast-food brand in South Africa, with Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM)’s KFC being the first. 18 - MexicoNumber of outlets - 366People per outlet - 348372McDonald’s opened in Mexico on October 29, 1983, in Pedregal.

In addition, it serves only halal food. All McDonald’s franchises in the southern and western regions of Saudia Arabia are owned by Reza Food Services. 16 - South KoreaNumber of outlets - 399People per outlet - 129864South Korea ranks number 16 on the list of countries with the most McDonald’s. McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in South Korea in 1998 in Apgujeong-dong. This coincided with the country’s Olympic fever, which turned out in McDonald’s favor. McDonald’s has since then expanded throughout South Korea. It has tailored its menu according to the taste of locals. South Korean McDonald’s serves items suited to local tastes, such as the Bulgogi Burger, which you won't find in any other country. 15 - TaiwanNumber of outlets - 409People per outlet - 58419McDonald’s opened its gates to the Taiwanese in 1984. It has a surprisingly large number of restaurants in Taiwan in comparison to the total population. Taiwan has 58419 people per McDonald’s outlet, which is less than Poland, Spain, Italy, Philippines, Brazil, and China, all of which rank higher in terms of total number of outlets. 14 - IndiaNumber of outlets - 512People per outlet - 2784718The first McDonald’s restaurant in India was opened in Bandra, Mumbai in 1996. In the next 12 years, 50 McDonald’s restaurants opened up across India. Today, India has 512 McDonald’s restaurants, and it is the second-largest fast-food chain in terms of revenue. 13- PolandNumber of outlets - 517People per outlet - 77093McDonald’s entered the Polish market in 1992 when it opened its first-ever restaurant in Warsaw.

It began its operations in Spain in 1981 when it set up its first restaurant in Madrid.  11- ItalyNumber of outlets - 669People per outlet - 88247Italy has 669 McDonald’s restaurants, making it the 11th country in terms of countries with most McDonald’s restaurants. Italy’s first McDonald's opened in Rome in 1986. McDonald’s opening in Italy stirred controversies surrounding fast food and gave way to the ‘slow food movement’. Yet, it has been able to establish its footing in Italy with one restaurant for 88247 people. 10 - PhilippinesNumber of outlets - 705People per outlet - 163913The first McDonald’s in the Philippines opened in 1981 in Morayta, Manila.

Then in July, Wendy's said it was going to extend its drive-thru hours even later.""We can build into customers' routines that we are there for them on the late-night daypart,"" Penegor said during the earnings call Wednesday.

Brands (YUM) are ""able to generate a lot more leverage over suppliers upstream and over independent software providers, and so they’re able to offer the same food at lower cost with equal or better margin,"" Dunlop says on Wendy's competitors.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Wendy's reporting earnings today, falling short of revenue estimates, but just beating profit expectations. Morningstar Equity analyst Sean Dunlop was on the call, earnings call earlier today and joins us now. We are seeing those shares under pressure right now in the session. What stood out to you, the big headline here coming out of the results today?SEAN DUNLOP: Yeah, what we're starting to see is a little bit more cautious of a US restaurant consumer, and that's a concern that we've harbored for a little bit of time. So same store sales grew 5.1% in the firm's home market. That suggested that it mostly maintained its share in the fast food category broadly, but did underperform both Burger King in the US, which had 8.3% comp, and McDonald's, which had 10.2% earlier in the quarter.So the reluctance of consumers to come into stores, traffic was a one point headwind. And then we see certain evidence of check management that certainly suggests to us that we're likely to see a bit more of a promotional environment moving forward, and maybe a little bit of difficulty driving durable comparable store sales growth over the rest of the year. That was probably our key takeaway.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: So what do you think of the pricing strategy here from Wendy's because they said that they're not going to be raising prices any further at least for now? We heard from some of their competitors like McDonald's that they may begin to adjust some of their pricing to the downside here as inflation does ease in the second half. Their pricing strategy up until this point, does it make sense?SEAN DUNLOP: I think it does. As you look at Wendy's core customer, they tend to skew a little bit less affluent than we see at some of the other chains. And they've obviously had a little bit more trouble attracting traffic, down 1% in the quarter relative to two peers like McDonald's, who saw plus 4%. So I think it makes sense to be very cautious, very cognizant of where the consumer is today.We saw the opposite example with Papa John's earnings where they raised prices a little bit too aggressively and where franchisees saw negative 2.3% comp in the US. That's certainly something that restaurants need to keep an eye on in the current environment.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. So let's kind of broaden it out into the space sort of beyond Wendy's because as you point out, consumers are getting a lot more price-sensitive. When you look at this particular landscape right now, who do you think is best positioned in that way? Who's got kind of the sweet spot where you think consumers are looking to and willing to shell out money even as these companies are able to juggle some of the costs that are still pretty elevated?SEAN DUNLOP: It's an interesting question. As we look back a couple quarters ago, we were saying that the operators that would be best positioned to navigate this kind of environment would be those that offered value-oriented fare. You start to think about the cheapest cost to feed a family of four, for example, some of the pizza players or with McDonald's, somewhat disruptive value menu offerings.We've seen a lot more incidence of barbell pricing where you've got the value-driven fare like Wendy's Biggie Bag on the bottom end of the scale and some of the more premium products to attract the clientele that's feeling a little bit less pressure. So in this sort of environment, we like restaurants that have sort of compelling value offerings. We like restaurants that have scale-driven cost advantages.You think about a McDonald's or Yum Brands that's able to generate a lot more leverage over suppliers' upstream and over independent software providers. And so they're able to offer the same food at a lower cost with equal or better margin. And with the way the consumer is feeling today, that position does those firms particularly well.SEANA SMITH: Sean, we've seen now Wendy's and some of its competitors also push a little bit further or push into late night offerings. It certainly seems like Wendy's is seeing early success within this offering. How do you see that? Or how big of a build could Wendy's potentially see in this offering here in the coming quarters, and how quickly?SEAN DUNLOP: Yeah. I wouldn't necessarily expect it to move the comp materially. I mean, we're talking about a couple points of comp as you think about where the dayparts break down. But the big news, I think, to take away from this is we're now at a point where the industry is only about 2% below pre-COVID staffing levels. We're starting to see wage inflation decline sort into the mid single digit range and declining month to month to month.So the hope is that this is reflective of an environment where restaurant margins are going to be pressured a little bit less, even as we start to see top line slow. And obviously, commodity prices were a boost in the quarter, and for most restaurants will continue to be over the balance of the year with maybe the notable exception of beef and potentially wheat.AKIKO FUJITA: Beyond the US when you look at some of the international markets for Wendy's, how do you see that faring in this environment? And how big of a driver do you think it can continue to be?SEAN DUNLOP: Yeah, a lot of markets outside the US, so it's very market by market. But it was interesting to see them ink the development agreement with Flynn. Obviously, they agreed to open up 200 new restaurants by 2034, which is relatively modest as you consider development agreements. But Flynn is the largest franchisee in the United States.So it's interesting to see them push abroad with Australia. They also acquired 260 Pizza Hut stores, which they operate a large US footprint of. With a lot of these international markets with Wendy's, it's challenging because Burger King and McDonald's already have substantial international footprints. That's true in Australia.And in most markets that tend to be smaller than the US food service market, there's not necessarily room for three players within one category like QSR burgers. We struggle to see tons of upside in some of those smaller markets like maybe in Australia or Germany or France.AKIKO FUJITA: Sean Dunlop, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the insight.]"

The taste is suitable for all sorts of people. It does not have risky flavor and spices. Fast food restaurants prepare and serve food within minutes, suiting the busy lifestyle of most Americans. Most fast food restaurants also deliver food to the home. Fast food restaurant companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) have established themselves in the American markets. So, it is very difficult for new restaurants from around the world to break through in the US. While it is difficult for new players around the world to break into the US market and get a sizeable market share, the growth and size of the US fast food market attract many startups to the US. One such example is Operation Falafel, a Dubai-based startup chain that is trying to break into the United States.Story continuesMcDonald’s is arguably the most popular fast-food restaurant in the world. It is present all over the world and is one of the leading fast food brands in the United States, which also tops our list of the countries with most McDonald’s restaurants. The first McDonald’s was opened in San Bernardino, California, in 1940. Since then, Mcdonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) has not looked back. Today, you can find Mcdonald's in all states of the United States and 120 countries around the world. If you want to find out about the top 3 countries with the most McDonald’s, we suggest you keep reading. Unsurprisingly, the United States accounts for 38% of total McDonald’s restaurants in the top 20 countries with the most McDonald’s.McDonald’s started as a drive-in restaurant. Its success was owed to its assembly line process, which enabled it to serve fast food within minutes. Franchising helped Mcdonald's expand to the entire world. Since 1955, McDonald’s has been a franchising company, and its franchisee played a major role in its success. While Mcdonald's has ruled the fast food market all over the world, it faces competition from other American brands. Subway has now taken over Mcdonald's in terms of total restaurants all over the world. However, Subway’s revenue of $15.2 Billion last year is less than McDonald’s $24 Billion. Top 20 countries With the Most McDonald's Restaurants saknakorn / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology For accuracy, we relied on the official McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) report. It listed all McDonald’s restaurants around the world by year-end 2022. We also took 2022 year-end population figures of the top 20 countries with the most McDonald’s, to calculate people per McDonald’s outlet.20 - MalaysiaNumber of outlets - 341People per outlet - 99526McDonald’s opened its first branch in Malaysia on Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur in 1982. After eight years of opening in Malaysia, it opened its first-ever drive-through restaurant in the country. Since Malaysia is a Muslim country, McDonald’s serves halal food. The menu is catered to the local taste, and pork is omitted from it. 19 - South AfricaNumber of outlets - 346People per outlet - 173104Mcdonald's is available in all of the nine provinces of South Africa. It entered the South African market in November 1995. Initially, McDonald’s faced tough competition from fast food brands in South Africa. However, it has 13% of the market share by revenue today. This makes McDonald’s the second-largest fast-food brand in South Africa, with Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM)’s KFC being the first. 18 - MexicoNumber of outlets - 366People per outlet - 348372McDonald’s opened in Mexico on October 29, 1983, in Pedregal. Since then, it has opened 366 branches throughout the country. It is one of the leading fast-food brands in Mexico, along with Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM)’s KFC. 17- Saudi ArabiaNumber of outlets - 371People per outlet - 98137McDonald’s first opened in Saudia Arabia in 1994, in Jeddah. Today, it is available in all the major cities, such as Medina, Makkah, and Tabuk. McDonald’s is the leading fast-food restaurant in Saudi Arabia in terms of revenue and sales. In addition, it serves only halal food. All McDonald’s franchises in the southern and western regions of Saudia Arabia are owned by Reza Food Services. 16 - South KoreaNumber of outlets - 399People per outlet - 129864South Korea ranks number 16 on the list of countries with the most McDonald’s. McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in South Korea in 1998 in Apgujeong-dong. This coincided with the country’s Olympic fever, which turned out in McDonald’s favor. McDonald’s has since then expanded throughout South Korea. It has tailored its menu according to the taste of locals. South Korean McDonald’s serves items suited to local tastes, such as the Bulgogi Burger, which you won't find in any other country. 15 - TaiwanNumber of outlets - 409People per outlet - 58419McDonald’s opened its gates to the Taiwanese in 1984. It has a surprisingly large number of restaurants in Taiwan in comparison to the total population. Taiwan has 58419 people per McDonald’s outlet, which is less than Poland, Spain, Italy, Philippines, Brazil, and China, all of which rank higher in terms of total number of outlets. 14 - IndiaNumber of outlets - 512People per outlet - 2784718The first McDonald’s restaurant in India was opened in Bandra, Mumbai in 1996. In the next 12 years, 50 McDonald’s restaurants opened up across India. Today, India has 512 McDonald’s restaurants, and it is the second-largest fast-food chain in terms of revenue. 13- PolandNumber of outlets - 517People per outlet - 77093McDonald’s entered the Polish market in 1992 when it opened its first-ever restaurant in Warsaw. On its opening day, McDonald’s branch served 30,000 customers, setting a record for the most customers served on the first day, as noted by Kafkadesk.org. McDonald’s is the largest fast food brand in Poland in terms of number of outlets. It is followed by KFC as the second-largest fast-food brand. 12- SpainNumber of outlets - 580People per outlet - 81998Coming in at number 12 in the list of countries with the most McDonald’s, Spain seems to love this restaurant. Mcdonald’s currently enjoys a 40% market share in Spain. It began its operations in Spain in 1981 when it set up its first restaurant in Madrid.  11- ItalyNumber of outlets - 669People per outlet - 88247Italy has 669 McDonald’s restaurants, making it the 11th country in terms of countries with most McDonald’s restaurants. Italy’s first McDonald's opened in Rome in 1986. McDonald’s opening in Italy stirred controversies surrounding fast food and gave way to the ‘slow food movement’. Yet, it has been able to establish its footing in Italy with one restaurant for 88247 people. 10 - PhilippinesNumber of outlets - 705People per outlet - 163913The first McDonald’s in the Philippines opened in 1981 in Morayta, Manila.

With new players and alternatives emerging in the market, McDonald's share in the food services industry in the UK is decreasing. However, it is still the leading brand in the food service industry in the Kingdom. 6 - GermanyNumber of outlets - 1,425People per outlet - 58449Germany has the sixth highest number of McDonald’s restaurants.The first McDonald’s in Germany opened in Munich in December 1971.

We like restaurants that have scale-driven cost advantages,"" Dunlop says.Companies like McDonald’s (MCD) and Yum! Brands (YUM) are ""able to generate a lot more leverage over suppliers upstream and over independent software providers, and so they’re able to offer the same food at lower cost with equal or better margin,"" Dunlop says on Wendy's competitors.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Wendy's reporting earnings today, falling short of revenue estimates, but just beating profit expectations. Morningstar Equity analyst Sean Dunlop was on the call, earnings call earlier today and joins us now. We are seeing those shares under pressure right now in the session. What stood out to you, the big headline here coming out of the results today?SEAN DUNLOP: Yeah, what we're starting to see is a little bit more cautious of a US restaurant consumer, and that's a concern that we've harbored for a little bit of time. So same store sales grew 5.1% in the firm's home market. That suggested that it mostly maintained its share in the fast food category broadly, but did underperform both Burger King in the US, which had 8.3% comp, and McDonald's, which had 10.2% earlier in the quarter.So the reluctance of consumers to come into stores, traffic was a one point headwind. And then we see certain evidence of check management that certainly suggests to us that we're likely to see a bit more of a promotional environment moving forward, and maybe a little bit of difficulty driving durable comparable store sales growth over the rest of the year. That was probably our key takeaway.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: So what do you think of the pricing strategy here from Wendy's because they said that they're not going to be raising prices any further at least for now? We heard from some of their competitors like McDonald's that they may begin to adjust some of their pricing to the downside here as inflation does ease in the second half. Their pricing strategy up until this point, does it make sense?SEAN DUNLOP: I think it does. As you look at Wendy's core customer, they tend to skew a little bit less affluent than we see at some of the other chains. And they've obviously had a little bit more trouble attracting traffic, down 1% in the quarter relative to two peers like McDonald's, who saw plus 4%. So I think it makes sense to be very cautious, very cognizant of where the consumer is today.We saw the opposite example with Papa John's earnings where they raised prices a little bit too aggressively and where franchisees saw negative 2.3% comp in the US. That's certainly something that restaurants need to keep an eye on in the current environment.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. So let's kind of broaden it out into the space sort of beyond Wendy's because as you point out, consumers are getting a lot more price-sensitive. When you look at this particular landscape right now, who do you think is best positioned in that way? Who's got kind of the sweet spot where you think consumers are looking to and willing to shell out money even as these companies are able to juggle some of the costs that are still pretty elevated?SEAN DUNLOP: It's an interesting question. As we look back a couple quarters ago, we were saying that the operators that would be best positioned to navigate this kind of environment would be those that offered value-oriented fare. You start to think about the cheapest cost to feed a family of four, for example, some of the pizza players or with McDonald's, somewhat disruptive value menu offerings.We've seen a lot more incidence of barbell pricing where you've got the value-driven fare like Wendy's Biggie Bag on the bottom end of the scale and some of the more premium products to attract the clientele that's feeling a little bit less pressure. So in this sort of environment, we like restaurants that have sort of compelling value offerings. We like restaurants that have scale-driven cost advantages.You think about a McDonald's or Yum Brands that's able to generate a lot more leverage over suppliers' upstream and over independent software providers. And so they're able to offer the same food at a lower cost with equal or better margin. And with the way the consumer is feeling today, that position does those firms particularly well.SEANA SMITH: Sean, we've seen now Wendy's and some of its competitors also push a little bit further or push into late night offerings. It certainly seems like Wendy's is seeing early success within this offering. How do you see that? Or how big of a build could Wendy's potentially see in this offering here in the coming quarters, and how quickly?SEAN DUNLOP: Yeah. I wouldn't necessarily expect it to move the comp materially. I mean, we're talking about a couple points of comp as you think about where the dayparts break down. But the big news, I think, to take away from this is we're now at a point where the industry is only about 2% below pre-COVID staffing levels. We're starting to see wage inflation decline sort into the mid single digit range and declining month to month to month.So the hope is that this is reflective of an environment where restaurant margins are going to be pressured a little bit less, even as we start to see top line slow. And obviously, commodity prices were a boost in the quarter, and for most restaurants will continue to be over the balance of the year with maybe the notable exception of beef and potentially wheat.AKIKO FUJITA: Beyond the US when you look at some of the international markets for Wendy's, how do you see that faring in this environment? And how big of a driver do you think it can continue to be?SEAN DUNLOP: Yeah, a lot of markets outside the US, so it's very market by market. But it was interesting to see them ink the development agreement with Flynn. Obviously, they agreed to open up 200 new restaurants by 2034, which is relatively modest as you consider development agreements. But Flynn is the largest franchisee in the United States.So it's interesting to see them push abroad with Australia. They also acquired 260 Pizza Hut stores, which they operate a large US footprint of. With a lot of these international markets with Wendy's, it's challenging because Burger King and McDonald's already have substantial international footprints. That's true in Australia.And in most markets that tend to be smaller than the US food service market, there's not necessarily room for three players within one category like QSR burgers. We struggle to see tons of upside in some of those smaller markets like maybe in Australia or Germany or France.AKIKO FUJITA: Sean Dunlop, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the insight.]"

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's How Quickly Is McDonald's Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that McDonald's' EPS has grown 20% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of McDonald's shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 43% to 46% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for McDonald's?Are McDonald's Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of McDonald's, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$381m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of McDonald's but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does McDonald's Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into McDonald's' strong EPS growth. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with McDonald's , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Although McDonald's certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

269,eb9a35d9-6705-304f-b590-b14b0529cb05,PPL,2023-08-10,PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) Shares Could Be 30% Above Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppl-corporation-nyse-ppl-shares-121851368.html,1691669931,STORY,['PPL'],"[Key InsightsUsing the Dividend Discount Model, PPL fair value estimate is US$20.11Current share price of US$26.23 suggests PPL is potentially 30% overvalued Analyst price target for PPL is US$30.67, which is 52% above our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for PPL The MethodAs PPL operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$26.2, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)Story continues= US$1.1 / (6.2% – 2.2%)= US$20.1dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PPL as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PPLStrengthNo major strengths identified for PPL.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 2 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

Prior to the new role, he was Occidental's vice president of strategic planning and analysis.Mathew was instrumental in completing Occidental's large-scale divestiture program of about $10 billion that was announced after the Anadarko acquisition, the company said in a filing.Occidental Petroleum last week raised its full-year production forecast by 1% but missed second-quarter profit expectations due to a slide in oil and gas prices and took a writedown to exit some operations.Shares of the company were top performers last year in the S&amp;P 500 index but they have lagged behind the market this year so far, rising 1% year to date compared to a 16.3% gain in the S&amp;P 500.(Reporting by Mrinmay Dey in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Rashmi Aich)]"

With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Brent Handler.Story continuesBrent HandlerThank you Kyle, and good morning everyone. The past few months have been a pivotal time for Inspirato. Before covering our second quarter results and some of the recent travel and booking trends we're seeing, I want to spend a few moments talking about our strategic investment and partnership with Capital One. Yesterday we announced entry into a definitive agreement for a new $25 million convertible note investment from Capital One Ventures. This investment will enable us to continue enhancing our experiences to meet the evolving needs of the luxury traveler. Capital One Ventures looks to harness the potential of innovative companies that can integrate well with its business and infrastructure. Capital One's customers are passionate about travel and we share a similar vision to find new ways to deliver luxury travel experiences with unprecedented service and certainty. Over the past 12 years, we have worked tirelessly to build a premier luxury hospitality brand. We take pride in delivering exceptional value and service to our members, and this summer, we've doubled down on this approach with several member-centric initiatives. In response to the current dynamics of the luxury vacation rental market and to ensure we are delivering significant value to our members, we have communicated broad base nightly rate reductions across our portfolio of managed and controlled accommodations, including a recently launched early booking discounts that encourages members to book further in advance, giving members peace of mind that advanced booking at preferred destinations will not sacrifice value or flexibility. In addition to matching our low everyday nightly rates with our members' travel needs, earlier this week, we launched Inspirato Rewards, our first ever member loyalty program. Inspirato Rewards offers our most engaged members, unique value added benefits and additional savings on Club bookings through tiered status levels, each with increasing valuable benefits. We are really excited about these new programs and offerings as well as the progress on our initiative aimed at optimizing our portfolio controlling costs, and ultimately generating sustainable profitability.Jumping into Q2, we delivered more than 47,000 total nights, a 1% year-over-year increase. While the advocating our residents portfolio was approximately $1,750 per night, representing a slight increase year-over-year.When considering seasonality, each metric is among the highest levels in company history. Yet looking closer, the increase in nights delivered has largely been in hotels, often with lower 90 rates and average margins as opposed to our residents. And while ADRs have increased, they have been at the expense of lower occupancy rates, 72% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to 82% a year ago. Overall, our second quarter travel behavior shared similar characteristics as the broad short-term rental vacation market and OTA market.We have seen solid nights delivered in ADRs, a continued bias towards hotel and urban travel as opposed to residences and resorts and an uptick to our European destinations, largely at the expense of U.S. travel. While our members were not alone in shifting towards Europe and urban-based travel, these property types constitute a smaller proportion of our portfolio, and urban-based travel typically comes with lower average ADRs and length of stay. As a result, this shift in travel behavior had an impact on our second quarter results and is expected to further impact travel revenue for the remainder of 2023. It's also important to remember that our second quarter results are more representative of travel behavior and strength of the consumer over the past 6 to 12 months as opposed to the next 6 to 12 months. From a booking perspective, second quarter dollars booked decreased 15% to 20% compared to both the first quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of last year. However, the recent formation of our member success team, which is designed in part to further engage members, has led to a slight uptick in bookings. More importantly, we believe the actions taken this summer of lowering ADRs instituting our advanced booking discount and launching Inspirato rewards will be important value enhancers for our members and improve the overall efficacy in our management control portfolio. As a result of these bookings and travel dynamics, we are reducing our 2023 revenue guidance by $30 million at the midpoint to $320 million to $340 million. Similarly, we are lowering our anticipated adjusted EBITDA loss to between $30 million and $45 million, primarily due to our reduced revenue expectations slightly offset by lower plan operating expenses. Of note revised revenue and adjust EBITDA's guidance do not contemplate any benefits from Inspirato Rewards or the Capital One Ventures partnership.Recent booking trends have further strengthened our conviction in monetizing our available capacity through strategic partnerships and our portfolio optimization efforts, while also highlighting the importance of the continued success of our Inspirato for Good and Inspirato for Business platforms.In terms of Inspirato for Good, we sold 3.7 million of trip and membership packages in the second quarter compared to 2.3 million in the first quarter and 1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Inspirato for Business also has solid results in Q2 with approximately 3.9 million of sales. It's important to note that as of June 30, Inspirato for Good and Inspirato for Business have generated cumulative sales of approximately 13.5 million, so only a small portion has been recognized as revenue. We believe these platforms cannot only serve as a material growth driver for Inspirato in the future, but will provide a stable, predictable revenue stream moving forward.Finally, I want to thank our employees for their tireless work and dedication to ensuring the success of our new initiative and member satisfaction.With that, I'll turn the call over to Robert to provide a bit more detail on our quarterly results.Robert KaidenThanks Brent. Before reviewing our second quarter results, I'd like to take a minute discussing our path to profitability. In past quarters, we've alluded to these initiatives in more qualitative sense, but today I'd like to provide more specific (inaudible) We have been decisive in executing our plans to drive significant savings on the 3 main categories: lease expenses, payroll, and non-payroll. First, after a detailed portfolio review, we have identified and taken action aimed at generate more than $25 million to annualized lease expense savings. This has largely occurred through giving notice of early termination and our non-renewal of poor performing properties. Next payroll. While the decisions were never easy, we were taking actions to more appropriately align our cost structure to our current and future revenue projections. On top of the January 12% headcount reduction in July, we reduced our headcount by an additional 6% and made the decision to temper hiring outside of (inaudible) that provide member support and service. We expect these actions to result in annualized savings of approximately $20 million.Finally, non-payroll cost savings. We expect these to be both above and below the line and cover vendor renegotiations, reduced booking fees through portfolio management initiatives and a decrease in professional services.Cumulatively, we've not only identified but have taken action on delivering more than $50 million of annualized cost savings. That will be critical in achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in 2024. Pivoting back to the second quarter, total revenue of $84 million was flat year-over-year and comprised of $36 million of subscription revenue and $48 million of travel revenue rental.Brent already covered some of the travel dynamics in the quarter. So shifting to subscription dynamics, we saw an increase of 1% in subscription revenue compared to Q2 2022. As the decrease in Pass subscription revenue was offset by increases in Club subscription revenue and the portion of in Inspirato for Good and Inspirato for Business sales recognized the subscription revenue.In terms of subscriber activity, we ended the quarter with 15,200 active subscriptions compared to 15,700 at the end of the second quarter of 2022. Year-over-year net decrease of approximately 500 subscriptions is entirely attributable to reduced Pass subscriptions partially offset by year-over-year increase in Club subscriptions. The decrease in Pass subscriptions was primarily due to fewer new sales as opposed to an increase in resignations. While we do expect our Pass subscription counts to decrease through year end, we believe our recent initiatives, which are primarily aimed at increasing paid occupancy, will help us deliver night in a more proportionate manner between our Club and Pass members. Ultimately replacing loss subscription revenue with increased travel revenue.Further as an offset to the decrease in access subscriptions, we sold approximately 1,200 Inspirato for Good packages in the quarter, which include a bundled Inspirato trip and a 6-month or 1 year trial membership. This compares to approximately 850 packages in the first quarter of 2023 and totals approximately 2,500 Inspirato for Good packages since inception in the fall of 2022, these members are not included in our subscription calendar, so we have started delivering travel and exposing these highly qualified profits to the benefits of Inspirato, and it begun to be a small but growing number of conversions to our Club and Pass offerings. Look for more on this in the future.Cost of revenue is $65 million for the quarter, an increase of approximately $7.3 million or 13% compared to the second quarter of last year. The increase in cost of revenue between periods was primarily due to a 28% increase in lease expenses related to leases that have commenced over the past year and a 15% increase in booking fees primarily related to our experience and bespoke travel program.Of note on our last call, we identified increase hotel booking fees as a cost we hope to reduce moving forward. In the second quarter, our focus on this area resulted in a decrease in hotel booking fees of 4% year-over-year and 20% sequentially as a portion of net rate hotel nights shift to our lease hotels and residences.Gross margin for the quarter was negative $11 million due to a $30 million non-cash impairment related primarily to one group of underperforming properties in a single geographic location.Excluding the impairment, our growth margin would've been approximately $19 million or 23% of revenue compared to $26 million or 31% of revenue in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in margin, both as an absolute 10% of revenue, is due to the increase in cost of revenue. Importantly, we offset this increase with a decrease in our operating expenses, which was $35 million in second quarter, a 15% improvement compared to $41 million a year ago. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined from 49% to 42% between periods. This improvement is primarily due to the reduction in force that took place in January of this year, and heightened focus on reducing corporate expenses. All this equated to an adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately $12 million in each of the second quarters of 2023 and 2022.As we've articulated today, we've seen a slowdown in new subscription sales, reduced paid residents, nights delivered, and a shift from residents of hotels. These trends have contributed to ending the quarter with a cash balance of $46 million compared to the $62 million on hand at the end of Q1. Similar to our efforts around controlled costs, we have responded with several changes. We have incentivized multi-year subscriptions to improve retention and stabilize our subscription revenue.Stood up a 100-person member success team to proactively engage with our members, lowered ADRs across our portfolio, implemented early booking discounts to encourage longer booking windows and more certainty around future revenue, and launched our first ever Loyalty Reward program. With our current cash position and cost savings, we anticipate to realize the remainder of the year and in 2024 and the financing we anticipate closing in the next several months. We are confident in our liquidity position moving forward, but unable to provide guidance on our anticipated yearend cash balance at this time.In summary, I'm extremely confident in our ability to execute what is in our control and adapt to external forces. We made incredible strides in the past few months and are extremely well-positioned to improve our operating efficiencies heading into the back of the year in 2024.With that, I'll turn the call over to the moderator for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperatorWe'll now conduct the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Shweta Khajuria from Evercore ISI.Shweta R. KhajuriaSo you mentioned that the European travel, you saw strength in European travel and the supply you have there is understood that is not as high as is compared to the U.S. So could you talk about supply growth in Europe, how you're positioned there and how you can leverage demand of international travel? And then the second question I have is how does the Loyalty Rewards work? So could you talk about not only how they work, but also the potential impact that you expect to see on a sustainable basis? What are you targeting with that program?Brent HandlerShweta, this is Brent. In terms of European travel, I think we're actually well-positioned. I believe last year was somewhat of an anomaly in terms of how many people were actually traveling to Europe relative to the U.S. We kind of view that as the final push, I guess post-COVID. We monitor bookings on a forward-booking basis, and we feel like our European portfolio, which also grew over the last couple of years is actually right sized and we don't anticipate having the type of unprecedented demand next year that we had this year. We also have really been listening to our members and thoughtful about our pricing of our domestic vacation rental properties. I think in the luxury segment in particular, there was just so much inflated price and in '21 for bookings in '22, there was really inflated demand when that started to kind of get back to a more realistic level, we probably were a little bit late in changing our pricing and we've been able to now address that actually with two changes in our pricing structure. So to answer your next question about Inspirato rewards, first I want to talk about something called our advanced booking discount, which we also just launched yesterday. So rewards and the advanced booking discount were launched yesterday. Very positive response from members. A lot of bookings yesterday. A lot of people purchasing travel credit yesterday to be booking into the future. And what we're essentially doing there is we're trying to offer better rates for our members if they book further in advance. Tier 4, we priced our inventory at the highest top price farther in advance because members would have the most flexibility with planning, with airlines. And then also obviously with availability, we've now flipped that a little bit and provided an incentive for our members to book further advance. And even after one day we're getting very positive response and we're seeing some change in behavior. In terms of our Reward program, which is on our website at Inspirato.com, it's in the top nav under Rewards. It's essentially a rewards program versus a point-based loyalty program. There's 3 tiers. The tiers are achieved based upon a member spend. It's how many dollars they spend with us in a year, and they're getting a 100% of their credit in a year, and then they get 5% of their total spend in previous years. The tiers are at 20,000 and 35,000 and 50,000 and yesterday, just to give you 1 kind of real simplistic example. We had an unengaged member who hadn't traveled with the Club since 2019, but had paid their dues, wanted to get to the top status level, so actually paid $50,000 of travel credit so they could become what's called an [Avanti] member. The discounts that they're able to achieve through the Reward program range from 10% on the low end to 20% on the high end based upon their status and based upon whether it's a 7-night stay or a shorter stay. In addition to that, there's all types of other great benefits, early booking discounts, all of the things our members have been asking for, really for about 10 years or so. We've put that together into a very exciting Rewards program, and we anticipate that activity kind of cascading upon itself and creating a lot more velocity from our members to book. We've shared this comment before, but at any given time, more than half of our members don't have a single reservation on the books for future travel. So this is a great opportunity for us to get our members to be engaged and traveling again. And because we have the ability to have lower prices, so long as we can get back up to our target occupancy and we have the right (inaudible) in Clubs, we're very optimistic that this should help us in our overall efficacy as we move into the end of the year and especially in 2024.OperatorOur next question comes from Brett Knoblauch from Cantor Fitzgerald.Brett Anthony KnoblauchPerfect. The first, the capital raised from Capital One Venture, I guess that partnership, can you elaborate on what type of revenue opportunities that partnership could create?Brent HandlerSure. First off, I guess I would just say we're remarkably excited about partnering with Capital One, that's a founder-led business, highly innovative, extremely disruptive in the space. They're a cloud-based mobile first really innovative business, and if you've kind of followed them, you've seen that they've done a great job of attacking new businesses, including travel and really making an impact to their card holders. They have more than a 100 million customers. They're also really one of the fastest growing small business card issuers, which is going to be we think very positive for our Inspirato for Business platform. And then beyond the card, they've invested very heavily in travel. They've become a big investor in Hopper. Hopper has really grown Capital One travel has really been extremely fast growing. They've also invested in airport lounges. They recently purchased Velocity Black, which is a mobile first, very high-end concierge platform. They invested in SevenRooms, which is a dining platform. And now with their investment into Inspirato, they're really looking to be able to access our luxury homes and our service and certainty. And we don't really have today the ability to share the details of the partnership. But what I can say is that we have a definitive signed term sheet and that we are working on getting the final definitive agreement done in the same timeframe as our shareholder vote upon closing, but we are extremely optimistic about them being an outstanding demand generator for Inspirato and what we can bring to the table in terms of our luxury platform. So if you ask me who I thought the best partner could be for Inspirato, it would not be a stretch for me to say Capital One. I think it's a perfect marriage, and we think that this is a game changer for us. And we are extremely excited about getting going.Brett Anthony KnoblauchI know terms of the deal maybe haven't been finalized yet. I guess from a modeling perspective, should we assume that you guys are raising $25 million with cash in third quarter, and I guess any idea of what maybe the interest rate would be on that, or should we just leave it out for the time being?Brent HandlerI think I can just direct you to the K-one -- or sorry to the 8K, excuse me, to the 8K that was released yesterday and I believe you'll be able to find details on the investment there.Brett Anthony KnoblauchGot it. And then is there any update on your partnership with Saks? How is that progressing?Brent HandlerSo the training has been completed with Saks. We view that as an extremely important partnership. The summer season for retail can be a little bit slower but we have seen some kind of good progress there. And as we move more into the season, we expect to see some further returns from the Saks investment. But with Capital One in terms of their travel and the innovative and the scale that they're bringing us in terms of that partnership plus Saks, which we view as the top tier luxury consumer brand, probably what you're starting to notice is in Inspirato is becoming very partner-friendly. And when you think about ways for Inspirato to grow, in addition to Inspirato for Business and Inspirato for Good, it has to do with us leveraging the platform that we've invested a lot into and the technology that we've built so that we can become very good partners to leaders in different classifications that can be demand generators for us.Brett Anthony KnoblauchAwesome. No, that makes sense. And maybe if I just ask one more. On the portfolio optimization strategy, where are we at with that now? Are we completed, should we expect continued portfolio optimization in the back half of the year? And then on the occupancy rate, I know 72% or 73% is still well above industry standards. I guess, what occupancy rate do you need to get the business to be adjusted EBITDA positive as you guys are targeting?Robert KaidenWe've made a lot of strides as it relates to the portfolio optimization. We're probably have locked in on 75% of all the deals that we're going to close on. Sometimes there's ones that we don't have a termination right until a certain date in the future. And so for those, that's why they're not all done at this point in time. But when we say that the difference between us entering into an agreement to terminate and the actual date of the termination, there's usually a 6-month or 12-month period. So we're not seeing the real benefits yet of any of these terminations. We'll start to see this start to bleed in really in Q4 is when the first group really will start to wind through and then there'll be more as we go through 2024. As it relates to the occupancy rate, 72% is a low rate for us historically, if you look across the different years this would be the lowest rate we've had. We expect that we'll be through the efforts that we take increasing the occupancy rates at 80% plus, which is consistent with where we've been in the past.Brent HandlerOne other is Brett, one other note on occupancy mix is extremely important as well. Pass is a great product for the Club. It's a great product for the member, but the Pass to Club ratio is out of balance in terms of how many Pass reservations are available relative to how many Club reservations are available. And as you know, Club reservations are considerably higher in terms of ADR. So in addition to increasing occupancy, we will also get back to a more favorable mix between Club bookings paid and state revenue, travel revenue versus Pass subscription revenue.OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Grondahl from Northland.Michael John GrondahlThe press released it (inaudible) multiple, what's the average duration in years that those new subscriptions are going for? Is that 2 to 3 years or how long are those?Brent HandlerMike, this is Brent. I cut out in the very beginning. I'm going to repeat the question if that's okay. I think the question is help me understand the average duration of your subscriptions. It seems like it's about 2 to 3 years. Did I get the question right?Michael John GrondahlYeah, I'll just add, the press release says that 80% of sales year-to-date have been multiple years. So I'm just curious you used to sell a 1 year plan of the 80% that have been multiple years on average, how long are they?Robert KaidenYes. Mike, thanks for the question. So we've definitely seen, and we've had a shift towards multi-year arrangements. On average, I think the ballpark you gave 2 to 3 years is about right. We do sell those subscriptions up to 5 years in length, 2 years is very common. So there's definitely though you see it every phase of that but there's a lot more in that 2 to 3 year range than we had in the past.Brent HandlerI think it's important, Mike, to note that last year we also had quite a few month subscriptions as well, so not just a year, but last year a lot of the subscribers that we were selling were in fact month-to-month. And so going from 2 plus years where last year the average was well under 1 year that the benefits of that in terms of retention, we'll start to see in 2024. And that's really just the norm moving forward.Michael John GrondahlGot it. And how should we think about IFG and IFB going forward? I mean, they are steadily ramping up. Are you putting more sales people behind those efforts or kind of how much attention are those getting?Brent HandlerIt's a great question. Both of those groups have been impacted just like the entire company in terms of corporate overhead and G&amp;A. So they're both, I'd say relatively smaller to where they were. I'd like to talk about IFG first. We've made a lot of great improvements. I mean, it's hard to believe, but those businesses are less than a year old. And so we had to go into a market in the nonprofit space and really learn from the ground up starting about a year ago. So what we've now figured out is what are the right packages? How do we do the right marketing? What's the correct messaging? Our repeat bookings is very high. We don't have exact numbers, but we think, we believe to the best of our knowledge, it's going to be around 65% to 70% of nonprofits who book an event with us, turn around and book a subsequent event with us. And we are increasing the dollar amount that we're offering to these nonprofits. We started with $2,000 and $4,000 packages. We now have packages well over $15,000 that are available to that market. So we do think that we're getting better. Our brand recognition is getting stronger and we anticipate strong growth within in Inspirato for Good. Inspirato for Business is a much larger opportunity. It's become very clear that the opportunity on the business side is very, very strong for Inspirato. We now have nearly 50 business customers who are working with the company. Every month we're bringing on new customers, extremely high satisfaction. These are employees who are given the gift of travel rather than say a spot bonus or an Amazon gift card. And they are typically thrilled with what it is that they're getting. Their employers are super happy. I had an employer tell me the other day that they sent out -- this is a pretty big company, they sent out a memo to all leaders that said, no more spot bonuses. You can't give a spot bonus, you can only give Inspirato travel benefit. So that is a good question in terms of growth, it is an area where we are doing some analysis now. We'll have more information to share in coming quarters, but we believe that there is a really strong payback period by bringing on new salespeople in that business and that it will make sense for us to be investing in Inspirato for Business and growing that platform. It's also just in terms of the core profitability of Inspirato for Business that does really well also just because of the makeup and how efficient it is to get these larger sales across the globe. So we're very excited about both, and I think it's reasonable to expect that you'll see some continued positive momentum in those segments.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Tom Champion from Piper Sandler.Thomas Steven ChampionHi, this is Jim (inaudible). Thanks for taking the question. I guess first one for Brent, with regards to the Capital One partnership assuming everything goes through, what sort of step one that ins Inspirato can do from an operational standpoint that can sort of drive the business going forward?Brent HandlerYes, great question, Tom. I think that the way to think about this partnership is that Inspirato has built a platform of service and certainty for luxury travel that's unmatched, especially when you consider the portfolio of homes that we exclusively manage and control. Over the 2 years where we had nearly 50% growth, it's been well-documented now that we grew too fast, we had too much inventory. We're now right sizing that inventory and at the same time we're bringing an incredible demand engine into our business as a partner in Capital One. So what I would say is that the benefit to Inspirato will be that Capital One will help us bring new subscribers, more travel demand into our platform. We also see opportunities with Velocity Black that Capital One just purchased. We think there's a great opportunity there for incremental demand. We also really look at the partnership from the lens of Inspirato for Business. They are a very, very, very big player in the corporate card space at really all levels of size. And we know that we do really well with our business platform, but getting help on the lead gen side and on the demand side will be extremely helpful there. So I think it is really about them being a great demand partner for us and us providing Capital One luxury travel and service and certainty that's really unattainable in the marketplace and details forthcoming when the definitive agreement is announced.Thomas Steven ChampionAnd then I guess one more for Robert. So it looked like subscription revenue was down sequentially again in 2Q. Should we expect that cadence to continue through the balance of '23?Robert KaidenYes. The breakout of the subscription revenue is really, it's a Pass story, Pass is down 500 plus and when you look at the rest of the subscriptions were flats up. So it's really the questions around Pass. And we do expect that for the remainder of the year at least, that we will see some further deterioration around our number of Pass holders. That being said, we have a tremendously loyal group of Pass members who use Pass very aggressively and very consistently as Brent mentioned before where they're going on far more trips per person than all of our other members. So while we do expect that decline to continue because we've seen it for the last 3 quarters now there is a point where we expect that that will start to level out because the Pass product really works really well for people who want to do a lot of traveling, it becomes a tremendous value proposition for them while other people in the post revenge spend era have kind of dropped back down to being able to travel a few times a year, which would be more consistent with a Club member.Brent HandlerOne thing to add there that, that we're learning pretty quickly and we're very excited about is what we did learn post-COVID, I guess just pre-COVID a little bit, and then post-COVID with Pass, is that we are able to attract an affluent traveler who can put in their brain, I'm going to spend $30,000 a year and I'm going to commit that amount of dollars and I'm going to travel. Now with Inspirato Rewards, we have the similar kind of budget. You could spend $20 or $30 or $50,000, but instead of it being with the Pass algorithm where you are limited, where you can go and you have to be flexible, but it is incredibly valuable, now you're able to make a commitment to travel with Inspirato and you're getting great benefits through Inspirato Rewards, and you spend the same amount of money, but maybe now you're going on that spring break trip exactly when you want and you're feeling great about the value that you're getting versus with Pass, maybe you couldn't travel over spring break, but instead you have to travel the first week of March and you're going to go to Europe instead of to Cabo. So we really now have 2 platforms that are both value centric that drive the 2 different types of consumer. The person who is super flexible that travels a lot, as well as typically families who just want to make sure they're getting what they want when they want it, and they can feel comfortable and confident in their bookings that they're going to be getting great value with the Club.Operator(Operator Instructions) At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to Brent Handler for closing remarks.Brent HandlerFantastic, thank you. Well, I just wanted to thank everybody for joining our call today. We're extremely excited on a variety of fronts. We're excited about Capital One. We're excited about the launch of Inspirato Rewards and our advanced booking discount. We're very excited for our loyal employees and for the opportunity we have ahead of us and the roadmap that we set for profitability next year. And we are out there kind of executing and we look forward to talking to everybody at the next call. Thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Improving communication and training as well as fostering trust between the company and its workers are some of the areas where Norfolk Southern could do better, according to a Wednesday report from the Federal Railroad Administration assessing the eastern U.S. Class I railroad’s safety culture.FRA’s report comes on the heels of an unrelated announcement Wednesday from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration describing a settlement among OSHA, NS and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way – Employes Division (BMWED) over alleged safety violations that occurred at the site where an NS train derailed on Feb. 3 in East Palestine, Ohio. Several days following the derailment, NS and state and local officials had decided to vent a tank car carrying vinyl chloride over concern that the car was in danger of exploding.On Friday, NS said it would be providing $500,000 as part of a grant to foster economic development in East Palestine. This would be on top of other significant funding to support the community.FRA cites 4 areas where NS could improve its safety cultureAlthough NS (NYSE: NSC) has taken steps to beef up its safety practices, there are four general areas where it needs to improve, FRA said.“Based on its assessment of NS’ safety culture and operational safety, FRA found the overall safety culture maturity at NS to be in the involving level, although individual NS safety culture elements may be leading or lagging in maturity,” FRA said in the report. “This middle level of safety culture maturity reflects both the positive changes and renewed commitment shown by NS’ leadership to improve safety as well as the areas where NS continues to operate in a manner that is reactive and focused on compliance with minimum safety requirements of federal regulations and industry standards.”One area is ensuring that communication is open and effective, according to FRA. Effective communication includes eliminating gaps and delays in the way NS responds to wayside detector alerts and alarms, as well as developing ways to improve the flow of information through the company.Story continuesAnother area for improvement involves fostering mutual trust between the company and NS employees via measures such as developing ways to ensure prompt and public responses to safety concerns and engaging with employees about how to improve trust and morale.A third area is to ensure that training and resources support company safety efforts. This includes providing training to front-line supervisors so that they can have leadership skills and feel “empowered to do their jobs.”And the fourth area is to develop a safety culture that is less reactive and more proactive and less focused on complying with the minimum in safety standards. This includes potentially implementing risk reduction and fatigue management programs.NS said in a statement that it welcomed FRA’s report. NS President and CEO Alan Shaw as well as other company leaders met with FRA Administrator Amit Bose on Tuesday to review the findings, according to the company.“We are a safe railroad driven to become even safer. To learn, we have to listen. It’s important to understand where the FRA believes we can do better, and we appreciate that they identified positive areas where we are already making progress,” Shaw said in a Wednesday release. “We want feedback from our regulators, from the unions that represent our craft colleagues, and from outside our industry like the consultants we’ve hired with deep safety experience from Atkins Nuclear Secured.”Shaw added that the railroad had sent the report to Atkins Nuclear Secured and will continue working on NS’ six-point safety plan. NS had announced in May that Atkins would be conducting an independent review of NS’ safety culture.FRA said in the report that it “is committed to assisting NS in reaching its goals to improve safety for the benefit of its operations, employees, and the communities where it operates,” and that the agency will follow up on its recommendations.The agency conducted the assessment of safety at NS from March 15 to May 15.Said Greg Regan, president of the union Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO: “We welcome today’s report from the FRA that examines the root causes of safety culture failures at Norfolk Southern, echoing years of concerns from rail workers and unions across the industry. We look forward to working with our federal partners in Congress and the Biden Administration to address these issues and implement strong rail safety reforms.”FRA’s investigation of NS’ safety culture was in response to the Feb. 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio. FRA since broadened its examination, with FRA Administrator Amit Bose saying in June that his agency would be conducting an audit of the safety cultures of all the Class I railroads as well producing a report looking at safety themes and trends with the industry at-large.OSHA, NS and BMWED reach settlement over alleged safety violationsAlso on Wednesday, OSHA said it, NS and BMWED had reached a settlement agreement in which NS has agreed to address several safety issues related to the train derailment, which consisted of a 49 rail car pileup, including 11 tank cars with hazardous chemicals. The chemicals ignited and the pileup burned for several days.NS agreed to the following:“Implement a medical surveillance program for all affected employees who worked at the derailment site.“Provide union employees with 40 hours of Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response training for future derailments.“Create a training program on lessons learned from the Ohio derailment.“Pay penalties assessed by OSHA for four safety and health violations.”“This agreement will improve the safety and health controls in place for Norfolk Southern employees who responded and help educate the rail operator’s employees on the lessons learned so they are prepared should another emergency occur,” OSHA Area Office Director Howard Eberts said in a release. “We are pleased by the collaborative safety and health efforts of Norfolk Southern Corp., Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division and contractors from the clean-up site who have been working together on this site remediation.”Penalties assessed by OSHA totaled $49,111. The penalties to NS pertain to four violations that OSHA found. The violations are related primarily to work that occurred on Feb. 4 when crews constructed track panels and laid them out on the south tracks, west of the spill location, according to OSHA. The agency added that NS addressed the hazards immediately. But as a result, OSHA issued the following citations:“Not developing an emergency response plan that included clear lines of authority, communication and training, site security, adequate site control and decontamination areas.“Failing to require workers to wear chemical resistant footwear when walking on contaminated soil.“Allowing employees without respiratory protection to pour cement on potentially contaminated soil.Not training workers about hazardous chemicals.”OSHA had conducted additional inspections on other groups in response to the Feb. 3 derailment. The agency inspected CTEH, an environmental consulting firm, and two companies involved in the cleanup: Specialized Professional Services of Washington, Pennsylvania, and Hepaco Inc. of Charlotte, Norh Carolina. OSHA did not give citations to CTEH or Hepaco, but it cited Specialized Professional Services for inadequate control of the site and decontamination areas, which OSHA says the company immediate corrected.OSHA also opened an inspection because of reports that employees with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had fallen ill after visiting area homes on March 6. The agency did not issue any citations from that inspection.“The health and safety of our employees is paramount, and we have worked closely with OSHA and BMWED throughout the investigation. Partnering with our craft colleagues is extremely important to us,” NS said in a statement. “We’ve reached a resolution that provides more training for our people, exceeding OSHA requirements, and makes our responses even safer. We’ve been clear in our goal to become the gold standard for safety in our industry, and this outcome furthers that mission.”Besides looking into potential violations of safety hazards, OSHA’s involvment in the federal response to the Feb. 3 NS train derailment has included joining the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to oversee site cleanup. OSHA also worked with the Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration in a non-enforcement role since Feb. 20, 2023, the agency said.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:NS works to move past $803M hit from Ohio derailmentOhio presses Biden for disaster relief for East PalestineWitness testifies freight car involved in NS train derailment was not inspectedNTSB examines communication gaps at East Palestine train derailment hearingFederal regulators plan broad safety review of all Class I railroadsShaw: NS is ‘going to be the gold standard in safety’Ohio rail union blasts Norfolk Southern’s ‘disregard’ for workers’ safetyThe post FRA, OSHA call on Norfolk Southern to review safety practices appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

(AP) — Norfolk Southern made improvements after one of its trains derailed, caught fire and spilled toxic chemicals near an Ohio town, but the company is nowhere near the “gold standard for safety” it is striving to be, according to federal regulators. Instead, the railroad is too often only willing to meet minimum safety requirements.The Federal Railroad Administration released its 143-page report on the Atlanta-based railroad’s safety culture Wednesday. The agency has been working on the report for months since thousands of people had to evacuate their homes after the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.Poor communication and mistrust between employees and managers are hindering Norfolk Southern’s efforts to improve safety, the report also said. The agency questioned whether the company's training for employees and managers is adequate.“At a time when so many people working on and living near train tracks are asking legitimate questions about how major freight railroads operate, railroads must have a culture and operations that are focused on safety,” agency administrator Amit Bose said. “This first-of-its-kind assessment — conducted immediately after the Norfolk Southern derailment in East Palestine — shows in too many instances the railroad should be doing more to ensure the safety people deserve.”The agency has promised to conduct similar safety culture reviews at all the major freight railroads, including CSX, Union Pacific, BNSF, Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Kansas City, but it hasn’t set a timeline for those reviews.Norfolk Southern is collaborating with workers on safety and addressing the report’s findings, said CEO Alan Shaw, who since the Feb. 3 derailment near Pennsylvania has repeatedly called for his railroad to set the “gold standard” for safety in the industry.Bose met with Shaw and several of the railroad’s other executives Tuesday to go over the findings, and the company gave a copy of the report to Atkins Nuclear Secured, an independent consultant with expertise in nuclear submarines that is reviewing the company’s safety program.Story continues“We aren't waiting” to act, Shaw said. He said the railroad will keep working on improvements it announced in March while trying to address the regulators' recommendations.Congress and regulators have called for all the major freight railroads to make a number of changes to improve safety but proposed legislation has stalled in the Senate and failed to get started in the Republican-controlled House.The rail agency said its assessment “shows numerous examples where NS seems more concerned with compliance with minimum safety requirements of federal regulations and industry standards rather than understanding and seeking to address safety concerns that fall outside the boundaries of existing rules and regulations.”And as investigators looked into the railroad's practices, they “encountered multiple instances of lapses in trust between employees and their frontline supervisors,” including times when employees refused to meet with investigators because they feared they would be disciplined for speaking out about their safety concerns.Shaw has defended the railroad's overall safety record and said its number of derailments is down since it began overhauling its operations in 2019 and making widespread job cuts in the name of efficiency. But the federal agency pointed out that between 2018 and 2022 the rate of accidents per million train miles on Norfolk Southern rose faster than any other major freight railroad.The agency said it has noticed some initial improvement since the derailment, but that it has been inconsistent as the railroad hasn't always communicated the changes well to all its supervisors and employees.Just last year the agency audited Norfolk Southern’s safety practices and training programs after three railroad employees — including two conductors who had been on the job less than a year — suffered amputations while on duty. The agency made 25 recommendations in that audit that the railroad didn’t promptly or comprehensively respond to.Just two days before the East Palestine derailment, ""NS responded, indicating that where recommendations exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements, they would take no further action, but did promise to engage in corrective action for the majority of the recommendations,” the report said.The National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating what caused the Ohio derailment after holding hearings on it in June. But that agency has said the derailment was likely caused by an overheating bearing on one of the rail cars. A sensor triggered an alarm about that bearing but the crew didn't have time to stop the train before cars loaded with hazardous chemicals began to careen off the tracks.The federal rail agency took a close look at how Norfolk Southern monitors those sensors and found that there was often only one employee — sometimes working from home — monitoring all the roughly 1,200 detectors throughout the railroad's network of 19,500 miles (31,382 kilometers) of track in the eastern United States. And that person relied on email to alert dispatchers about any problems — creating the possibility of a delay in notice. That person also dealt with reports of mechanical problems from train crews and safety concerns reported by the public.In addition to Wednesday's report, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it had fined the railroad $49,111 for failing to provide proper protective gear and adequate hazardous materials training to the workers who were sent to East Palestine immediately after the derailment to rebuild the tracks.Norfolk Southern also agreed establish a medical monitoring program to track the health of workers who were at the site and improve its training for future derailments as part of a settlement with OSHA.Tony Cardwell, who leads the union representing track maintenance workers, said he's glad to see OSHA doing something to hold the railroad accountable because its “actions were completely derelict.” Cardwell said he was “blown away” when he learned that his members were working at the derailment site just in their normal leather gloves and boots and not in the hazmat suits he kept seeing on news reports.“Unless agencies step in and force the carriers to do these things, they won’t do them because there’s a cost associated with it,” said Cardwell, who is president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union.]"

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.0bUS$12.4bUS$13.3bUS$13.9bUS$14.4bUS$14.9bUS$15.3bUS$15.7bUS$16.1bUS$16.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.56%Est @ 3.13%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.49%Est @ 2.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$10.3kUS$11.0kUS$11.1kUS$11.0kUS$10.7kUS$10.4kUS$10.1kUS$9.7kUS$9.4kUS$9.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$103bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$420bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$420b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$231bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$334b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$61.1, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Coca-ColaStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Through the end of August, over 50 brands, including Coca-Cola, Friends With Benefits, a social decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and NFT creator platform Zora will host NFT mints on Base network.In addition to branded NFT offerings, Coinbase is collaborating with Prop House, an incubator linked to NFT project Nouns DAO, to give out over 100 ETH, or $186,000, in grants for developers building on Base. They’re also encouraging developers to enroll in the ETH Global Superhack, an upcoming hackathon that will offer $175,000 in rewards.To bolster community engagement around Base, Coinbase is encouraging users to bridge their ether to Base in order to mint a free NFT to commemorate the launch of the Base mainnet.

Jesse Pollak, Protocols Lead at Coinbase, told CoinDesk that Onchain Summer aims to showcase how NFTs can be leveraged as a technology rather than just a speculative asset.Story continues“We wanted to give people a reason to be on-chain this summer and set up their first wallet and experience this future,” said Pollak.Onchain Summer’s first week will feature daily mints, starting with Friends With Benefits, who will issue an NFT on Thursday designed by artist Deekay Kwon alongside pseudonymous NFT collector Cozomo de Medici. On Saturday, Coca-Cola will open a mint of digital artworks from the Masterpiece collection, with works from artists Aket, Fatma Ramadan and Vikram Kushwah, as well as famed painters Edvard Munch, Johannes Vermeer and Vincent van Gogh.“The world will come on-chain because of great product experiences that people all over the world build,” said Pollak. “That's where we're focused on.”Base is an Ethereum layer 2 network built upon Optimism’s OP Stack. Last week, Coinbase made its Base public launch date official after having opened its mainnet early for developers in July who wanted to begin testing the network. However, during this testing period, an anonymous developer created the infamous BALD token on Base network, which rose to an $85 million market capitalization before plunging when its creator pulled most of the projects’ liquidity, rugging holders.See Also: Coinbase Exec: ‘There’s No Playbook’ for Public Company Launching Blockchain]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.7% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.54%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.17%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software had gained 8% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.4% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.35% in that time.Intuit will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 24, 2023. On that day, Intuit is projected to report earnings of $1.38 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 25.45%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.64 billion, up 9.41% from the prior-year quarter.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Intuit. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Intuit currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Intuit currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 32.26.

If you want to skip our discussion on the financial industry, head directly to 5 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To Buy. In the last two years, the financial services industry has shown resilience in navigating uncertainty caused by the pandemic, which created upheaval in real estate, insurance, investment, banking, and capital markets. Despite this, ongoing challenges like geopolitical tensions, inflation, and supply chain disruptions could lead to increased regulations and transparency demands in 2023. According to Deloitte, retail banks are expected to face challenges like higher rates, inflation, and lower growth. Global banks' net interest income should grow, but stress in the housing market could impact Asia-Pacific earnings. The United States is also facing issues in mortgage and auto loan markets, with scrutiny on additional fees impacting bank balance sheets. On a positive note, demand from retail banking customers improved cross-channel experiences during tough times. Deloitte believes that central bank rate hikes could improve commercial bank net interest income, although clients seeking higher interest rates might lead to deposit product rate increases. Don't Miss: 10 Best Cybersecurity ETFsAs per IMF, the initial projection is for a growth decline, moving from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023, and eventually settling at 3.0% in 2024. Advanced economies are forecasted to undergo a prominent growth slowdown, nosediving from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.3% in 2023. In an alternative scenario involving more financial stress, global growth would decrease to roughly 2.5% in 2023, with advanced economies seeing growth under 1%. IMF noted that even more concerning is the fact that the significant tightening of policies over the past year is now adversely impacting the financial sector. After a prolonged phase of low inflation and remarkably low interest rates, the abrupt tightening of monetary policies last year has caused notable losses in long-term fixed-income assets. Story continuesNew trends are shaping the finance sector in 2023 and beyond. For example, artificial intelligence is reshaping multiple industries, including finance. According to a report by RSM US, financial institutions can benefit from AI in four key areas – loan application processing, compliance and risk management, fraud detection, and customer service. Secondly, conventional financial products are typically designed for the average user, resulting in products that may be functional but lack exceptional customer satisfaction. Fintech firms are now emphasizing on hyper-personalization to adapt to evolving consumer preferences. Moreover, with the increase in outsourcing, numerous organizations are expanding their utilization of third-party service providers. Asset management firms, in particular, are embracing this trend to concentrate on their primary expertise – interacting with clients and overseeing assets, while outsourcing other functions. Also Read: 15 Worst Performing Bank Stocks in 2023Although the performance of the financial sector in 2023 has been unstable due to skyrocketing inflation and banking systems collapsing, it has historically been a resilient S&amp;P 500 component.

We see a clear path to upside earnings revisions as the company expands new products that increase its total addressable market and drive average revenue per user growth.”9. Invesco S&amp;P 500® Equal Weight Financials ETF (NYSE:RSPF)5-Year Performance as of August 9: 24.19%Invesco S&amp;P 500® Equal Weight Financials ETF (NYSE:RSPF) mirrors the S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index's performance. The ETF was launched on November 1, 2006. As of August 7, 2023, its portfolio comprises 73 stocks and the fund offers an expense ratio of 0.40%. Invesco S&amp;P 500® Equal Weight Financials ETF (NYSE:RSPF) is one of the best financial ETFs to buy. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is the largest holding of the Invesco S&amp;P 500® Equal Weight Financials ETF (NYSE:RSPF). Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) offers different financial products and services, operating through Commercial Bank, Retail Bank, Wealth Management, and Finance segments. On July 21, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) reported a Q2 GAAP EPS of $2.01 and a revenue of $924 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.15 and $21.41 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading position holder in Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), with 3.17 million shares worth $137.8 million. Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and is comprised of Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF)5-Year Performance as of August 9: 25.42%Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF)’s primary objective is to achieve investment results that closely align with the price and yield performance of the Financial Select Sector Index. This index aims to accurately represent the financial sector within the S&amp;P 500 Index. As of August 7, 2023, the fund has an expense ratio of 0.10% and assets under management worth $35.5 billion. Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF)’s portfolio consists of 72 stocks and it is one of the best financial ETFs to monitor. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is the largest holding of the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF). Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)’s operating earnings for Q2 2023 experienced a 6.6% year-over-year increase, reaching $10 billion, marking an increase from $8.07 billion in the preceding quarter and $9.42 billion in the same quarter last year. This growth was primarily attributed to robust performance in its insurance division, which saw notable improvements in both underwriting and investment income. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 108 hedge funds were bullish on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), compared to 110 funds in the prior quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust held the largest stake in the company, comprising 19.6 million shares worth over $6 billion. Here is what Black Bear Value Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Going forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.7. First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE:FXO)5-Year Performance as of August 9: 28.27%First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE:FXO)’s primary aim is to achieve investment outcomes that generally correspond to price and yield performance of the StrataQuant Financials Index. This index, referred to as an ""enhanced"" index, is created, maintained, and sponsored by ICE Data Indices and employs the AlphaDEX stock selection method to pick stocks from the Russell 1000 Index. The fund was introduced on May 8, 2007, and its net expense ratio remains 0.62% as of December 1, 2022. The ETF's portfolio consists of 100 stocks. First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE:FXO) is one of the best financial ETFs to buy.Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) is the biggest holding of First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE:FXO). Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) is the holding company for Western Alliance Bank, which offers a range of banking products and associated services, primarily catering to Arizona, California, and Nevada. On July 18, the company reported a Q2 GAAP EPS of $1.96, in line with market estimates.

Lansing Davis’ Davis Capital Partners is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.50 million shares worth $88.85 million. Miller Value Deep Value Strategy made the following comment about Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the quarter, we initiated positions in Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) and Gray Television (GTN). Western Alliance is a leading national commercial bank with strong regional markets. The company has a capital-light business model (less branch focus). Following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, Western Alliance saw significant share price weakness as the marketplace tried to draw similarities between the two companies. While initially experiencing deposit weakness, that has subsided and returned to growth as Western has a significantly more diversified business model with long-term customers having multiple products and services. The company’s underwriting capabilities and operations are best-in-class in our opinion. Management also appears fully aligned with shareholders and focused on shifting underwriting to a lower risk portfolio of loans. The company has taken incremental actions that should have accretive benefits to enhance capital ratios starting this quarter and further improving into 2024. Western’s share price is down 60%+ from its 52-week high, a deep discount to book value and 30%+ normalized earnings yield. We anticipate Western’s earnings troughing in the near term and improving over the next 6 to 12 months.Long-term growth should remain above the peer group, ROAs at the high end of the industry, supporting Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) of 18-20%, with possible upside to 20-22% as the mortgage market improves over time. Both estimates are nicely above consensus long-term expectations. Over the next 3-5 years, returning to normalized EPS and valuation expanding back towards its historical average would support upside potential near three times current price levels.”6. iShares U.S. Financials ETF (NYSE:IYF)5-Year Performance as of August 9: 29.22%iShares U.S. Financials ETF (NYSE:IYF) seeks to replicate the investment outcomes of the Russell 1000 Financials 40 Act 15/22.5 Daily Capped Index, which is composed of U.S. financial sector stocks.

(NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has rebounded nicely following the mini-bank crisis in March. They held an analyst meeting in May at which they gave updated guidance on net interest income. They expect net interest income to increase to $84 billion from its forecast of $81 billion as First Republic assets will get a nice boost from rising interest rates.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To Buy.  Suggested articles:Wall Street Analysts Are Bullish on These 10 Stocks with Increasing Price Targets12 Stocks That Will Benefit From AI10 Industries Being Revolutionized By AI and Automation Technologies Disclosure: None. 10 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ:VRSN) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for VeriSign The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$924.0mUS$972.0mUS$1.01bUS$1.04bUS$1.08bUS$1.11bUS$1.13bUS$1.16bUS$1.19bUS$1.22bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 3.91%Est @ 3.38%Est @ 3.01%Est @ 2.75%Est @ 2.57%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.29% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$858US$839US$810US$778US$744US$710US$677US$644US$612US$582(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.3bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.2b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.2%) = US$23bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$23b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$11bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$18b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$205, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at VeriSign as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.100. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for VeriSignStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For VeriSign, we've put together three fundamental elements you should look at:Risks: You should be aware of the 3 warning signs for VeriSign (1 is a bit concerning!) we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does VRSN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

We have also covered interesting discussions on different IoT applications. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the World. As of 2022, the global Internet of Things (IoT) market was valued at around $544 billion. It's also estimated to grow significantly in the coming years, with projections indicating it will reach approximately $662 billion in 2023 and a whopping $3.35 trillion by 2030. This impressive growth is expected to result in a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.1% during the forecast period.Many big players in the industry, like Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Siemens AG, have been providing IoT platforms and solutions from deployment services to smart city initiatives and industrial edge solutions. These technologies enable the interconnection of devices using different communication technologies that offer valuable interoperable information without human intervention. If we are to speak about the biggest IoT products in the market, smart watches, smart refrigerators, medical sensors, and fitness trackers would all make it to the list. To read more about the impact of digitalization and artificial intelligence, you should check out our article on Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.How is IoT Making Waves in Industries?IoT has become a pertinent game changer in the healthcare industry by transforming surgical display technology. Through interconnected devices, IoT-enabled surgical displays can integrate data from various medical sources that can provide surgeons with a comprehensive view during medical procedures. Not only does real-time data sharing foster collaboration among medical professionals, it has also added to the quality of patient care and decision-making. Moreover, IoT has facilitated remote monitoring and troubleshooting of displays which has largely reduced downtime and ensures continuous functionality.Story continuesThe generosity of IoT services is not limited to the healthcare sector. In fact, it has tapped into the unexplored potential in urban transportation. The combination of electric bikes (e-bikes) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a win-win idea as E-bikes offer a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional commuting with addressing issues like traffic and pollution. On the other hand, IoT technology enhances e-bikes by providing real-time tracking, remote diagnostics, and seamless integration with other transport options through apps. This data also helps improve urban planning for better infrastructure and traffic management.Challenges for the Internet of Things to Look Out ForThe biggest challenge that comes with the IoT is the implementation of IoT security in the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. As IoT integrates the physical world with computer-based systems, the attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase and hence, attracts malicious actors. In industrial settings, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is especially critical but harder to secure due to long-standing, hard-to-upgrade components with limited maintenance windows.Existing IoT cybersecurity standards from organizations like NIST and ISA are complex which also makes implementation harder as technical documentation for some security standards runs over thousands of pages. Moreover, harmonizing security for both older ""brownfield"" and new ""greenfield"" systems is equally complicated and complex.Another challenge is that government regulations often lag the rapid evolution of IoT technology which leaves businesses without essential information to make decisions. The absence of robust IoT regulations contributes to its security risks, especially as critical devices like medical equipment and cars become connected.Quality control is challenging due to the influx of IoT devices from countries like China that have varying security standards. Thus, experts advocate for strong and universal security standards to address these concerns, as the potential attack surface expands to include more crucial devices. Moreover, the lack of sufficient regulation can raise eyebrows and lead to potential disaster scenarios in the IoT landscape.Let's now move to the biggest IoT companies in the world.20 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the WorldZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe methodology used to rank the Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the world is based on the annual revenue generated by IoT companies in 2022.

While that may be the case, we’ve seen soaring healthcare stocks too. The observations here are very stock specific though.When we look at the technology sector, that’s where the action seems to be.Mega-cap tech has been driving the Nasdaq higher, as the index is up about 36.5% so far in 2023. When it comes to FAANG, the worst performer of the group — Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) — is still up almost 50% year to date. The ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is up almost 60% this year, showing the recent strength in growth stocks too.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsYet, when we look at the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLV), it’s actually down about 2% so far this year. Over the last 12 months, shares are only flat. Despite that though, many individual healthcare stocks are hitting new highs. These stocks continue to quietly churn out steady gains and fly under the radar. Let’s look at a few now.Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now: Cardinal Health (CAH)Daily chart of CAH stockClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpiderCardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) has been trading incredibly well so far this year. While the XLV ETF is still down a bit this year, Cardinal Health is up an impressive 20%. From the February low, shares are up more than 33%.Despite the lofty run, shares still pay out a 2.2% dividend yield. Even better, analysts are calling for about 12.5% revenue growth this year and 9% growth next year. On the earnings front, estimates are even better. Consensus expectations call for 13.5% growth in 2023 and an acceleration to 15% growth in 2024.Even though the stock has had a nice run, shares still trade at less than 16 times earnings. Now working on its fourth weekly decline in the last five weeks and CAH stock is pulling back.If it can hold the $90 level — and thus the 10-week moving average and recent support, it could charge back up to the $95 level. Above $95 and investors will turn their attention to $100.Story continuesA Dividend Stalwart Has New Life: Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)JNJ is a leading healthcare stockClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpiderI have been wondering when Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) would get the attention it deserved. The company and the stock have a lot going for it, but investors have not been willing to pay up for this name. Until now.On July 20, the company delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat, growing sales by 6.4% year over year and beating revenue estimates by $860 million. Management also gave a boost to its full-year revenue and earnings outlook.At first, the stock was little moved, opening higher by just 2% — after a three-day skid and a stretch where the stock declined in nine out of 12 sessions — but then bulls got on board. Shares rallied 6% the day it reported earnings, then rallied for six straight days. In all, the stock rallied over 10% on its earnings results.Despite falling after its talc-related lawsuit bankruptcy plan was rejected a second time, shares held right where they needed to. That’s as the $165 to $166 area held as support. If the stock can fully rebound, $175 is in play, then the $180s. However, a break of $165 may set up a test of uptrend support.It’s also worth mentioning J&amp;J’s dividend status. In April, the company delivered a 5.3% dividend increase, the 61st consecutive year of dividend increases for Johnson &amp; Johnson.A Brewing Breakout: UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Daily chart of UNH stockClick to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpiderUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) suffered a nasty fall going into earnings, declining almost 7% as shares fell in seven out of eight trading sessions.Then the firm reported earnings — a top- and bottom-line beat where sales of $92.9 billion beat expectations by almost $2 billion — and the stock responded instantly. Shares climbed about 15% amid a four-day rally, which was part of an eight-day post-earnings win streak.Shares are ramming right into a key downtrend level now, but are also holding above an important area as well. That’s as the stock is above all of its daily moving averages, while holding support around the $500 area, 200-day moving average and the second-quarter high.If UNH stock can hold this zone and clear the $515 level, it opens the door to the 2023 high up near $530, then potentially puts the $550s in play.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in JNJ and UNH.

This has clearly led to some need to reset expectations for companies that have a lot of exposure there,"" said Raymond James analyst Olivia Tong.Meanwhile, the world's top luxury group LVMH last month flagged cooling demand for high-end apparel and accessories in the U.S. as a post-pandemic surge loses steam.U.S. demand for luxury goods has taken a knock in the past few quarters as wealthy shoppers pause a splurging spree amid still high inflation.THE CONTEXTThe frail recovery in China has been highlighted by companies ranging from Procter &amp; Gamble to L'Oreal amid record high youth jobless rate and no solid stimulus measures yet to boost domestic consumption.On Wednesday, the world's second-largest economy's consumer sector fell into deflation in July for the first time since February 2021.""For China, the consumer has been somewhat cautious during the reopening compared to what the American consumer has been,"" said Rick Patel, analyst at Raymond James.Another crucial growth driver for luxury goods makers, travel retail, or sales made at airports or travel destinations, is also yet to recover fully from the pandemic slump.A ""lower guidance (is) likely at Estee Lauder"" as spending trends in Hainan - a top travel destination in China - appear softer than expected, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said, adding he does not expect to see a rapid rebound in the region.Story continuesKnown for its MAC lipsticks, Estee typically gets about 30% of its annual revenue from the Asia Pacific region - its second largest market.Capri gets a little more than 15% of its net sales from Asia, and the company in May pinned its full-year forecast on ""stronger-than-previously-anticipated trends from the reopening of China"".However, it is not all gloomy for the sector.Companies, including Ralph Lauren and Coach handbag maker Tapestry, are expected to fare slightly better, thanks to a product assortment that has stuck with consumers in China and the U.S.THE FUNDAMENTALS** Capri is expected to show an 11.7% decline in first-quarter revenues, with net income falling more than 57%** Estee Lauder is likely to report a 2% fall in revenue and a loss of 3 cents per share for its fourth fiscal quarter, compared to a profit of 42 cents a year earlier** Meanwhile, revenue at Tapestry is expected to rise and that at Ralph Lauren to drop marginally, while profits at both companies are projected to surge** Capri and Ralph Lauren report first-quarter earnings on Thursday, while Tapestry and Estee Lauder report on August 17 and 18, respectivelyWALL STREET SENTIMENT** Estee Lauder shares have slumped about 32% this year, with Capri declining nearly 39%** Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren and Tapestry have gained 23% and 9%, respectively(Reporting by Deborah Sophia and Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)]"

But Febreze, the brand that has reinvented the way people refresh their homes for the last 25 years, is now asking them how they want it to feel. Introducing the new Mood Collection from Febreze, a set of three high-quality, blended scents designed to set the atmosphere of every room in your home, whether you’re in need of relaxation, giving your space an alluring feeling, or looking to feel invigorated.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230809401930/en/The NEW Mood Collection from Febreze includes three new luxurious scents designed to create moods for every room in your home, whether you need a boost of energy, time to restore, or a little help romanticizing your space. (Graphic: Business Wire)Each scent in the Mood Collection features fragrance notes known to evoke certain moods—such as citrus for energy, roses for romance, and shea butter for calming. Additionally, marking a departure from traditional Febreze offerings like Linen &amp; Sky or Mediterranean Lavender, the variety is named for the mood it evokes, rather than the fragrance profile.The three scents in the new lineup are:Refresh &amp; Energize, surfacing notes of rejuvenating water reminiscent of a cool, rushing waterfall, along with zesty orange blossom, to awaken the senses with optimistic energy.Romance &amp; Desire, which infuses the delicate allure of pink rose petals with the effervescent excitement of a champagne spritz for an intoxicating aura of beauty, elegance, and romance.Soothe &amp; Restore, calling to mind whipped warm sugar and shea butter for a delectable scent with soft, velvety notes that ease tension and build a sanctuary of serenity and restoration.""Our research revealed consumers are interested in air care not only as a way to fight odors and leave a fresh scent behind, but specifically as a way to impact their moods,"" said Angelica Matthews, Febreze Brand Vice President. ""The new Mood Collection delivers on an emotional need. Not only does it just smell great, but it helps consumers shift from considering how an air freshener can make their room smell, to how an air freshener can make their room feel.""Story continuesTo celebrate the launch, Febreze partnered with three up-and-coming musicians to produce songs that complement each of the three new Mood Collection scents. The Febreze setlist includes:Refresh &amp; Energize by Four WashingtonFour Washington is a breakout family band from Jackson, Mississippi, beloved by TikTok’ers who say their songs just hit different. It’s little wonder why: siblings Cameron, Carmen, Reginald Jr., and Arrianna clearly have a touchingly strong sibling bond and first received renown for their acapella covers of popular songs, all perfectly in sync.The song was inspired by Four Washington’s signature vocal harmonies, using upbeat instrumentals to capture the energizing vibe created by Refresh &amp; Energize. It also reflects the group’s love of diverse harmonies coming together as one – the same way the varying scent cues blend together to create a unique and inspired scent.Romance &amp; Desire by Wé AniWhile Wé Ani’s musical prowess was clear early on as a kid at the Harlem School of the Arts, she captured the hearts of the country with her soulful performance on The Voice. Since then, she has shared the stage with legendary artists, and become a top 5 finalist on season 21 of American Idol. Wé is a committed humanitarian and a worldwide ambassador for World Vision, dedicating her time and resources to making a positive impact on communities in need.The song begins like a romantic homage to classic R&amp;B, before transforming into a dynamic vocal performance from Wé. This slow buildup and the powerful, yet refined production, were composed to capture the mood created by Romance &amp; Desire.Soothe &amp; Restore by Ebony LorenEbony Loren is a 22-year-old singer/songwriter based in Los Angeles whose passion for music sparked early: she has been singing ever since she learned to speak and she taught herself how to play guitar and piano. Ebony enjoys making acoustic pop music with heavy R&amp;B and jazz influences, and hopes to reach people all over the world with her music, and to become a role model for young artists just like herself.Ebony’s signature acoustic, soft pop style perfectly reflects the mood evoked by Soothe &amp; Restore. She took creative inspiration from the sweet and soothing notes, aiming to create a track that was calming, yet uplifting.The new songs help amplify the emotional effect of each Mood Collection scent in the home by harmonizing scent with sound. The collaborations will live on TikTok and the radio, and represent yet another way Febreze is providing a platform for up-and-coming artists to share their talents with a broader audience.The new Mood Collection from Febreze will be available online and at major retailers nationwide with an MSRP of $3.30.

305,424a9e27-ebe2-30fd-9b5f-71a720c8181b,SRCL,2023-08-10,"Is Stericycle, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SRCL) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Financials In Any Way?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stericycle-inc-nasdaq-srcl-recent-114938615.html,1691668178,STORY,['SRCL'],"[Most readers would already know that Stericycle's (NASDAQ:SRCL) stock increased by 4.4% over the past week. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Stericycle's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Stericycle How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stericycle is:0.9% = US$22m ÷ US$2.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.01 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Stericycle's Earnings Growth And 0.9% ROEIt is hard to argue that Stericycle's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even when compared to the industry average of 11%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Despite this, surprisingly, Stericycle saw an exceptional 30% net income growth over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Stericycle's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 11%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is SRCL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Stericycle Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Stericycle doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Stericycle has some positive attributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Moreover, the figure declined 13% from the year-ago quarter’s 46 cents. Shares of Macerich gained marginally in the Aug 8 regular trading session on the NYSE.The results reflected a year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues. However, this retail REIT experienced a decline in same-center net operating income (NOI), including lease termination income, from the prior-year period.Quarterly revenues of $212.4 million were higher than the year-ago quarter’s $204.1 million.

307,964417fd-a28a-386d-89ce-73d8b9d71fe1,DHI,2023-08-10,We Think D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-d-r-horton-nyse-140011764.html,1691589611,STORY,['DHI'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton What Is D.R. Horton's Net Debt?As you can see below, D.R. Horton had US$6.12b of debt, at June 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it also had US$3.13b in cash, and so its net debt is US$3.00b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is D.R. Horton's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, D.R. Horton had liabilities of US$5.67b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$4.57b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.13b in cash and US$315.9m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$6.80b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Since publicly traded D.R. Horton shares are worth a very impressive total of US$43.1b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.D.R. Horton has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.46. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 1k times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On the other hand, D.R. Horton's EBIT dived 13%, over the last year. If that rate of decline in earnings continues, the company could find itself in a tight spot. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if D.R. Horton can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. In the last three years, D.R. Horton created free cash flow amounting to 20% of its EBIT, an uninspiring performance. That limp level of cash conversion undermines its ability to manage and pay down debt.Our ViewD.R. Horton's interest cover was a real positive on this analysis, as was its net debt to EBITDA. But truth be told its EBIT growth rate had us nibbling our nails. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about D.R. Horton's debt levels. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with D.R. Horton , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

While these extra clouds can reflect sunlight back into space during the day, certain contrails can trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere at night.The study, led by Google Research and Breakthrough Energy and with support from American, tested whether it is possible to identify atmospheric zones that are likely to create contrails. The team then determined whether pilots could avoid making contrails in flight when supplied with data regarding the location of these zones.""American is grateful for the opportunity to work with our partners at Google Research and Breakthrough Energy to help advance the science on contrail avoidance,"" said Jill Blickstein, Vice President of Sustainability at American. ""The results from this small-scale test are encouraging, and, while clearly there are more questions to answer about how to operationalize contrails avoidance across our industry, we're excited to have played a role in establishing this first proof point. And we're looking forward to sharing what we learned with stakeholders in the aviation industry and beyond.""After collecting large data sets - such as satellite imagery, weather and flight path data -Google Research and Breakthrough Energy used artificial intelligence (AI) to develop contrail forecast maps. A small group of American pilots flew 70 flights over six months, using AI-based predictions to make small modifications to routes that were projected to create contrails.""Our contrails predictions combine the latest in AI research with massive amounts of satellite imagery, weather data and flight data,"" said Juliet Rothenberg, head of product for Climate AI at Google Research. ""We now have the first proof point that commercial flights can use these predictions to avoid contrails, as verified in satellite imagery. We're grateful for our partnership with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy - together we've taken a significant step towards understanding a high-potential climate solution.""Story continuesAfter the test flights, Google Research analyzed satellite imagery and found that flights where pilots used the AI predictions to avoid creating a contrail reduced contrail formation by 54%, as measured by distance, compared to flights where pilots did not use the predictions. This first proof point - albeit on a small number of flights - shows that a commercial flight can verifiably avoid creating a contrail. Additional research is necessary to determine if this success can be replicated and scaled.""Avoiding contrails might be one of the best ways to limit aviation's climate impact, and now we have a clear demonstration that it's possible to do so,"" said Marc Shapiro, Director of Breakthrough Energy Contrails. ""This study is a great example of what happens when creative, ambitious organizations work together to better understand and solve a tough problem, and we're grateful for American's and Google's partnership.""American is working to make its operations more sustainable with more-fuel efficient aircraft powered increasingly by low-carbon fuel and new technology. To achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the airline has set a number of ambitious intermediate targets.

As employer sentiment and business health remains steady, there are opportunities for employers to support employee financial health.According to the latest Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM, while both employers' and employees' top concerns include rising costs and macroeconomic challenges, employers feel more satisfied with their business's present financial situation than employees feel about their personal finances. And although employees and employers largely report they're able to meet their respective financial obligations, that doesn't translate into workers feeling as satisfied with their current financial situation. Only 34% of employees are ""always"" or ""often"" satisfied about their personal finances compared to more than 70% of employers who are ""always"" or ""often"" satisfied about their business's finances.""As business owners continue to see growth, it's important to recognize their employees may feel less confident about their financial growth and there are ways to provide greater support,"" said Amy Friedrich, president of Benefits and Protection at Principal®. ""Employer support could be offering financial wellness tools or providing a holistic benefits package that meets their employees' needs. This support can be a key differentiator for employers, helping them retain talent, while also making a real difference in the financial lives of their employees.""According to the survey, nearly two thirds of employees wouldn't be able to cover expenses for longer than three months if they lost their main source of income. When examining this trend based on demographic differences, over half (55%) of Gen Z and 44% of Millennial employees wouldn't be able to cover expenses after the first month without their main source of income. Additionally, women are more likely to say that they couldn't cover expenses for more than one week, while men are more likely to say they'd be able to cover expenses for six months or more.Story continuesBusinesses continue to experience high levels of growth Employer sentiment remains high, despite persistent concerns about inflation and the stability of the U.S. economy. More businesses are currently growing compared to this time last year (64% vs. 52%). Small businesses1 also reported year-over-year increases in growth (58% vs. 46%). However, while most businesses report growth, they're less optimistic about the overall growth of the U.S. economy.""Small businesses continue to demonstrate positive sentiment and steady cash flow,"" said Friedrich. ""However, when you move beyond their specific business or region, employers are less confident about the broader economy.""Employer support for financial well-being Employers play a critical role in the financial well-being of their employees2. With more than half of employees more stressed about their finances than last year, there are opportunities for employers to pass on their positive sentiment and build a foundation that enables employees to plan for their financial futures.The survey found the more optimistic a business is about the next 12 months, the more likely they are to add certain benefits such as critical illness, childcare support, financial wellness programs, and Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) to name a few.Financial wellness programs are expected to emerge as an additional plan resource to further personalize the employee experience3. Outside of retirement savings programs, top financial wellness benefits small businesses believe should be offered include helping employees establish a budget and financial plan, retirement income planning, and investment education. These benefits are key to boosting how secure employees feel across life and work.See all results and insights from the latest Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM (PDF).About the Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM The Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM surveys business owners, decision makers and business leaders aged 21 and over who work at companies with 2 - 10,000 employees. The nation-wide survey, commissioned since 2012, examines the financial well-being of American workers and business employers.

In the first pulse of the Well-Being Index in 2022, the employee audience was added to the survey to compare and contrast key sentiment from employers. The survey was commissioned by Principal® and conducted online by Dynata from June 5 - 12, 2023, with a total of 500 business owners, decision makers and business leader participants and a total of 200 employee participants.

ATO.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Defensive Stocks for Stable Returns Amid Recent VolatilityWall Street has been witnessing volatile trading since the beginning of August. U.S. stock markets saw an impressive rally in the first seven months of this year after a disappointing 2022. Although the long-term trend is still bullish, investors should prepare for short-term fluctuations to protect their portfolios. Recent volatility arises primarily from three sources. Fed Reinitiates Interest Rate HikeOn Jul 26, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5.25-5.5%. This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001. Notably, since March 2022, the central bank hiked its interest rate in 10 consecutive FOMC meetings before taking a pause in the June 2023 meeting.It reinitiated the rate hike regime as the inflation rate remained elevated at almost double the Fed’s 2% target rate. In his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said ""The process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."" The central bank remains open to more rate hikes, depending on economic data. Fitch Downgrades U.S. RatingOn Aug 1, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA. The agency cited “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.” In May, Fitch placed the AAA rating of the nation on the negative watchlist.Fitch expects the general government deficit to rise to 6.3% of U.S. GDP in 2023 from 3.7% in 2022. The agency remained concerned about a steady deterioration in the standards of governance over the last 20 years. Notably, in 2011, S&amp;P had downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA.Story continues Moody’s Downgrade Ratings of U.S. BanksOn Aug 8, Moody’s Investors Service cut the rating of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. Moreover, the rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade. Moody’s also changed its rating outlook to negative for 11 banks.According to Moody’s, “U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets.”The rating agency also said “Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate portfolios.”Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, health care and utilities to safeguard one’s portfolio.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced positive, two-year (96 weeks), topline data from the pivotal PULSAR trial investigating aflibercept 8 mg in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD). During the trial, aflibercept 8 mg patients were initially randomized to either 12- or 16-week dosing intervals (after three initial monthly doses) and were able to shorten or extend dosing intervals if pre-specified criteria were met. The longer-term data follow the positive two-year results for PHOTON with diabetic macular edema (DME), with PULSAR similarly demonstrating that the vast majority of aflibercept 8 mg patients with wAMD were able to maintain or further extend their dosing intervals. Among those who completed the two-year follow-up:88% were on a ≥12-week dosing interval at the end of two years.78% maintained ≥12-week dosing intervals throughout the two-year study period, compared to 83% throughout the first year of study (48 weeks).71% met the extension criteria for even longer dosing intervals, including 47% for ≥20-week intervals and 28% for 24-week intervals.Of those assigned to ≥16-week dosing regimen at baseline, 70% maintained ≥16-week dosing intervals throughout the two-year study period. At the end of two years, 78% were eligible for ≥16-week dosing, with 53% eligible for ≥20-dosing week intervals.“It is great to see aflibercept 8 mg deliver another set of exciting results,” said Charles C. Wykoff, M.D., Ph.D., Director of Research at Retina Consultants of Texas and a trial investigator. “In the PULSAR trial, aflibercept 8 mg achieved impressive durability, while importantly maintaining visual acuity gains from year one through year two. These data are consistent with the results from the PHOTON trial in diabetic macular edema, with both trials demonstrating a consistent safety profile with substantially fewer treatments than EYLEA. If approved by regulatory authorities, aflibercept 8 mg has the potential to become the new standard of care for diabetic macular edema and wet age-related macular degeneration.”Story continuesPULSAR (N= 1,009) is a double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trial evaluating non-inferiority of aflibercept 8 mg 12-week (n=335) and 16-week (n=338) dosing regimens compared to an 8-week dosing regimen for EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection (n=336). All patients received three initial monthly doses. The PULSAR trial met its primary endpoint last year with aflibercept 8 mg patients achieving clinically equivalent vision gains to EYLEA. Through two years, vision gains were sustained and remained largely consistent with the results at one year. Through 48 weeks (one year) Through 96 weeks (two years) EYLEA8-week regimenaflibercept 8 mg12-weekregimenaflibercept 8 mg16-weekregimen EYLEA8-week regimenaflibercept 8 mg12-weekregimenaflibercept 8 mg16-weekregimenMean number of injections^6.96.15.2 12.89.78.2LS mean (SE) change from baseline, letters7.0(0.74)6.1(0.77)5.9(0.72) 6.6(0.73)5.6(0.77)5.5(0.75)Difference in LS mean (95% CI), letters -0.97*(-2.87, 0.92)-1.14†(-2.97, 0.69)  -1.01‡(-2.82, 0.80)-1.08§(-2.87, 0.71)LS: least squares; SE: standard error ^Based on patients completing week 48 or 96 in the trial *Non-inferiority p-value: p=0.0009†Non-inferiority p-value: p=0.0011‡Nominal non-inferiority p-value: p=0.0006§Nominal non-inferiority p-value: p=0.0007        In PULSAR, the safety of aflibercept 8 mg continued to be similar to EYLEA through two years and remained consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials for wAMD. There were no cases of retinal vasculitis, occlusive retinitis or endophthalmitis in the aflibercept 8 mg group. The rate of intraocular inflammation was 1.3% for the aflibercept 8 mg group and 2.1% for the EYLEA group. Anti-platelet trialists' collaboration-defined arterial thromboembolic treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg and 3.3% of patients treated with EYLEA.“Through one and two years of treatment, aflibercept 8 mg has repeatedly demonstrated unprecedented durability in maintaining clinically meaningful outcomes with extended dosing regimens for patients with retinal disease,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of EYLEA. “Throughout the development of aflibercept 8 mg, we have focused on meaningfully transforming the treatment of retinal disease for patients. With PHOTON and now PULSAR, we are proud to have produced landmark, long-term results that may help to reduce the treatment burden for the millions of people living with wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema around the world.”The two-year data from PULSAR are planned for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. The two-year data from the pivotal PHOTON trial for aflibercept 8 mg in DME were presented at the American Society of Retina Specialists annual meeting in July 2023.Aflibercept 8 mg is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Aflibercept 8 mg is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg following any regulatory approvals.About the Aflibercept 8 mg Clinical Trial Program PULSAR in wAMD and PHOTON in DME are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: aflibercept 8 mg every 12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks. The lead sponsors of the trials were Bayer for PULSAR and Regeneron for PHOTON.Patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 3 initial doses in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON. In the first year, patients in the aflibercept 8 mg groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.About wAMD and DMEwAMD is a retinal disease that may affect people as they age. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and leak fluid under the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision and seeing fine detail. This fluid can damage and scar the macula, which can cause vision loss. An estimated 1.4 million Americans have wAMD.DME is a common complication in eyes of people living with diabetes. DME occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damaged blood vessels in the eye that leak fluid into the macula. This can lead to vision loss and, in some cases, blindness. Of the nearly 28 million American adults living with diabetes, an estimated 1.2 million have DME.About Ophthalmology at RegeneronAt Regeneron, we relentlessly pursue groundbreaking innovations in eye care science to help maintain the eye health of the millions of Americans impacted by vision-threatening conditions. Over a decade ago, our breakthrough scientific research resulted in the development of EYLEA, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels in the eye. EYLEA has since brought fundamental change to the retinal disease treatment landscape and is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 11 years of real-world experience, and more than 64 million EYLEA injections globally.Regeneron continues to advance our anti-angiogenesis expertise with new solutions with the aim of offering optimal flexibility for a broad group of patients and eye care professionals. This includes aflibercept 8 mg, which has been developed with the aim of extending the time between injections, while maintaining the vision gains, anatomic benefits and safety previously observed with EYLEA.IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONSEYLEA (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) (0.4 mg [0.01 mL]).CONTRAINDICATIONSEYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSIntravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.In infants with ROP, reactivation of abnormal angiogenesis and tortuosity may occur following treatment with EYLEA. Infants should be monitored closely after injection with EYLEA until retinal vascularization has completed or until the examiner is assured that reactivation of ROP will not occur. Treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring and additional EYLEA injections and/or laser treatments may be necessary.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.In pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA the most common adverse reactions (≥4%) reported were retinal detachment, conjunctival hemorrhage, and intraocular pressure increased. Adverse reactions established for adult indications are considered applicable to pre-term infants with ROP, though not all were observed in the clinical studies.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.For more information, please see full Prescribing Information.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops, and commercializes life- transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Union Pacific is:51% = US$6.7b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.51 in profit.Does Union Pacific Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Union Pacific has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Union Pacific's Debt And Its 51% Return On EquityUnion Pacific does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.51. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course Union Pacific may not be the best stock to buy.

That's lower than the average price this time last year, at $4.06, but slightly higher than last week's average price at $3.78.And that may have larger implications on consumer spending and how Americans feel about the economy, especially heading into the important back-to-school shopping season.""[Consumer] sentiment is very directly and very profoundly affected by gas prices,"" Michael Zdinak, economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance (see chart below). He added that there's a roughly 70% correlation between gas prices and sentiment over the time period shown below.One reason for that is consumers see gas prices and food prices move in real-time, he said.According to eToro global market strategist Ben Laidler, the move in gas prices from $3.09 in December 2022 to the national average price on Monday at $3.83 is an extra annual cost of roughly $101 billion for US consumers in total (based on the estimate that Americans use roughly 375 million gallons of gas each day).With where gas prices stand — and they should remain elevated — that means consumers have less money to spend elsewhere, such as discretionary purchases.'Sour outlook' for retailers?Higher gas prices, in addition to a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments this fall, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, higher cost of groceries, and a potential rise in the CPI reading due out this Thursday could form a perfect storm for US consumers — and change the way they shop.If American consumers' fears about the economy start to happen, incomes will take a hit, Zdinak said, which in turn could ""sour our outlook for spending.""Yet ""consumers have been shockingly resilient"" following a pandemic, ongoing war overseas, and a bank crisis earlier this year, he added — so it will take a lot to change the narrative this year.Story continuesSome of these themes are playing out in the back-to-school shopping season already underway.A Deloitte survey found that 68% of US parents expect to spend the same or less on back-to-school compared to last year. More than half (51%) said inflation is to blame for less disposable income while 75% said they plan to spend less because of higher prices.Although spending habits for the back-to-school season won't be reflected in next week's quarterly retail earnings results, Morningstar senior analyst David Swartz noted that ""expectations are not high, partly because of the gas prices and student loan payments but mostly because spending on apparel has cooled off since a very strong year in 2021.""""Retailers that cater to wealthier shoppers, such as Lululemon or Anthropologie, may be doing better than ones that sell to lower-income consumers, like Kohl’s or Urban Outfitters,"" said Swartz, who covers retailers such as Macy's (M), Nike (NKE), and Gap (GPS).A person pumps gas at a Shell gas station on August 03, 2023, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell via Getty Images)Excess savings to be depleted by the end of the year, per BNP ParibasThere's another factor that could affect consumers' ability to ride out higher gas prices: diminishing savings.""All this savings accumulated from the pandemic,"" BNP Paribas senior US economist Andy Schneider told Yahoo Finance. ""That was a real tailwind last year while the real wage story was a headwind, so ... now they've really flipped.""According to Schneider, those excess savings allowed consumers to ""shrug off"" headwinds such as higher inflation and high gas prices.But now, ""excess savings is becoming more of a headwind,"" he added. ""It's running down and we think that should be more or less depleted by the end of the year.""All this means less extra cash for consumers to sit on.""I think it's just a new era,"" Schneider said, adding: ""Now people are going to have to broach something like higher gas prices without being able to rely on a higher stock of savings that they had last year, and this year they don't.""Still, there may be some good news for Americans: Outside of a major shock to oil prices, the worst may be behind us when it comes to higher prices at the pump.""Barring a hurricane or OPEC production cut, we may have seen our peak and may see slight declines (not major),"" Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis, told Yahoo Finance.

326,a280df3d-a2c9-3823-8d82-adddc22aa17d,CSCO,2023-08-10,Cisco Systems (CSCO) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-csco-earnings-expected-221115949.html,1691619075,STORY,['CSCO'],"[The market expects Cisco Systems (CSCO) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 16. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of routers, switches, software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +27.7%.Revenues are expected to be $15.05 billion, up 14.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cisco?For Cisco, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cisco will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cisco would post earnings of $0.97 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1, delivering a surprise of +3.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cisco doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.7%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.54%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.17%.Coming into today, shares of the seller of routers, switches, software and services had gained 1.8% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.35%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Cisco Systems as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be August 16, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Cisco Systems to post earnings of $1.06 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 27.71%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $15.05 billion, up 14.84% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Cisco Systems. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.1% higher. Cisco Systems is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.Digging into valuation, Cisco Systems currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.14. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.79.Story continuesWe can also see that CSCO currently has a PEG ratio of 1.88. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

We have also covered interesting discussions on different IoT applications. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the World. As of 2022, the global Internet of Things (IoT) market was valued at around $544 billion. It's also estimated to grow significantly in the coming years, with projections indicating it will reach approximately $662 billion in 2023 and a whopping $3.35 trillion by 2030. This impressive growth is expected to result in a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.1% during the forecast period.Many big players in the industry, like Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Siemens AG, have been providing IoT platforms and solutions from deployment services to smart city initiatives and industrial edge solutions. These technologies enable the interconnection of devices using different communication technologies that offer valuable interoperable information without human intervention. If we are to speak about the biggest IoT products in the market, smart watches, smart refrigerators, medical sensors, and fitness trackers would all make it to the list. To read more about the impact of digitalization and artificial intelligence, you should check out our article on Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.How is IoT Making Waves in Industries?IoT has become a pertinent game changer in the healthcare industry by transforming surgical display technology. Through interconnected devices, IoT-enabled surgical displays can integrate data from various medical sources that can provide surgeons with a comprehensive view during medical procedures. Not only does real-time data sharing foster collaboration among medical professionals, it has also added to the quality of patient care and decision-making. Moreover, IoT has facilitated remote monitoring and troubleshooting of displays which has largely reduced downtime and ensures continuous functionality.Story continuesThe generosity of IoT services is not limited to the healthcare sector. In fact, it has tapped into the unexplored potential in urban transportation. The combination of electric bikes (e-bikes) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a win-win idea as E-bikes offer a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional commuting with addressing issues like traffic and pollution. On the other hand, IoT technology enhances e-bikes by providing real-time tracking, remote diagnostics, and seamless integration with other transport options through apps. This data also helps improve urban planning for better infrastructure and traffic management.Challenges for the Internet of Things to Look Out ForThe biggest challenge that comes with the IoT is the implementation of IoT security in the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. As IoT integrates the physical world with computer-based systems, the attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase and hence, attracts malicious actors. In industrial settings, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is especially critical but harder to secure due to long-standing, hard-to-upgrade components with limited maintenance windows.Existing IoT cybersecurity standards from organizations like NIST and ISA are complex which also makes implementation harder as technical documentation for some security standards runs over thousands of pages. Moreover, harmonizing security for both older ""brownfield"" and new ""greenfield"" systems is equally complicated and complex.Another challenge is that government regulations often lag the rapid evolution of IoT technology which leaves businesses without essential information to make decisions. The absence of robust IoT regulations contributes to its security risks, especially as critical devices like medical equipment and cars become connected.Quality control is challenging due to the influx of IoT devices from countries like China that have varying security standards. Thus, experts advocate for strong and universal security standards to address these concerns, as the potential attack surface expands to include more crucial devices. Moreover, the lack of sufficient regulation can raise eyebrows and lead to potential disaster scenarios in the IoT landscape.Let's now move to the biggest IoT companies in the world.20 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the WorldZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe methodology used to rank the Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the world is based on the annual revenue generated by IoT companies in 2022.

330,d1afac13-c1a9-3e13-be5a-b0c946c282af,CSCO,2023-08-10,3 Stocks to Watch as Ethereum Builds Base on PayPal Boost,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-watch-ethereum-builds-120500698.html,1691582700,STORY,"['CSCO', 'ACN', 'PYPL', 'CME']","[Ethereum (ETH) has always showcased its competency as an open-ended decentralized software platform. It is one of the selling points of the world’s second most-used cryptocurrency. However, PayPal Holdings, Inc.’s (PYPL) announcment on Monday that it would be introducing its own U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), could spark some serious debate.PYUSD is an Ethereum-based stablecoin, which would, after introduction, be pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. It has been designed for digital payments and the web, and will soon be available for U.S. customers. But even as this is bound to push Ethereum stocks up by establishing its place as the money layer on the Internet, it will also hit the crypto coin’s core value of decentralizing.Centralization issues are the most common attack areas within the gamut of decentralized finance or DeFi, one of the crypto world’s main differentiating features. In 2021 alone, DeFi hacks amounted to no less than $10 billion, revealing patterns of how the transactions are classified and tracked. Now, with around 430 million accounts actively using PayPal, the chances of cluster attacks would go up.Many smart contract auditors have highlighted that the PYUSD algo contains “freezefunds” and “wipefrozenfunds” functions, which are textbook examples of centralization attack vectors. Concerns have also been raised about the digital contract that users would sign, and that these contracts resemble censorship-enabled central bank digital currency.Despite this, Ethereum would get a massive boost once the project goes live. It would finally give Ethereum the mainstream push that it has been seeking all these years in its competition with Bitcoin (BTC). Coupled with the Shanghai Upgrade, under which it shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this might be ETH’s year.Powered by these developments and what has largely been hailed as a crypto rebound, the price of Ethereum has soared 53.9% this year as of Aug 8. So, with Ethereum getting this push, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source blockchain platform, decentralized or not.Story continuesAccenture plc ACN is a global system integrator that provides consulting, technology and other services, and markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.Accenture’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 8.2%.
