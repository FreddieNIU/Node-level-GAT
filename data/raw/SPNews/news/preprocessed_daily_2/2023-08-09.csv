And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 87% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.3% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 6.2% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Texas Instruments, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Texas Instruments. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Texas Instruments already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Texas Instruments, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Texas Instruments. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.6%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 4.2% of the stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Texas Instruments Incorporated in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$186m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Texas Instruments better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Texas Instruments   (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File)Stocks of many of these banks closed down by more than 1%. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) and the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) both dropped more than 1% as well.Moody’s attributed its decisions to a series of pressures making life more difficult for mid-sized financial institutions across the country, from higher deposit costs and eroding profitability to new capital requirements and a commercial real estate slump.The trigger for many of these issues is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to cool inflation with higher interest rates. Moody's said that campaign ""continues to have a material impact on the US banking system’s funding and its economic capital.""""I don't think that the ratings downgrades suggest that there's more weakness coming that we didn't already see,"" JPMorgan US equity strategist Abby Yoder told Yahoo Finance Live, describing what happened as a ""rearview mirror"" look at the sector.The move downward in many regional bank stocks, she added, had more to do with the fact that many of these stocks had rallied in recent weeks.In fact, many investors pushed stocks higher following a series of second quarter earnings that appeared to ease any lingering fears that mid-sized financial institutions faced the sort of existential threat that surfaced in the spring when the failures of three sizable banks triggered outflows across the banking system.Story continuesDeposits were up at most smaller banks, even those that suffered outflows during the first quarter.But there was one troublesome trend that emerged from those second quarter results. Namely, most regional banks attracted more deposits during the quarter by paying a lot more for them, thus cutting into a key measure of profitability.Many, as a result, revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year, including PNC and Truist.Fifth Third also trimmed its full-year forecast range for net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and what they pay for their deposits.""We're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well, and if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings,"" Fifth Third chief executive Tim Spence said last month.The fresh volatility introduced by Moody's may come in handy for regulators as the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency try to sell a complex overhaul of new capital standards for banks.They argue the changes are needed to make lenders stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for shocks like the crisis of this spring.The new capital proposals are expected to face pushback from the banking industry, which argues that lenders are much more resilient than they were during the 2008-09 financial crisis and that higher requirements could restrict lending.Many midsize banks that could be part of these new rules are already making adjustments by holding back on any increases in dividends or share buybacks. Several also are selling assets to reduce the risks on their balance sheets or examining a pullback in certain types of lending.Banks are ""doing the right things,"" Yoder, the JPMorgan equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live, citing the restructuring of balance sheets ahead of new regulatory requirements.Banks will probably be less profitable, but in the long term, she added, ""they will be in better shape.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Revenue guidance now at around $93 billion this year. That is down from a prior forecast of roughly $97 billion. Much of the hit being put down to the impact of labor negotiations.The UPS and the Teamsters Union reached a tentative deal on a new contract at the end of July. Union members are yet to approve it, however. These results won't come as a huge shock to investors. At the end of April, UPS warned that volume would remain under pressure due to current macro conditions.Moody's has cut its rating on 10 small and mid-sized US banks and warned it could downgrade bigger lenders as well. There were official downgrades for the likes of M&amp;T Bank, Pinnacle, Webster Financial. 11 banks in total were put on a negative outlook including larger lenders like PNC, Capital One and, Citizen's. Those are all falling in premarket trading. Bigger plays like Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp, and State Street are all under review for a potential downgrade.And the good times keep rolling for Eli Lilly. Thanks to a strong drug pipeline, the pharma company upping its full-year guidance after second quarter profit rocketed 85% from a year ago. It now sees full-year revenue landing between $33.4 billion and $33.9 billion, much of the tailwind coming from its type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro which, of course, is also being used off-label for weight reduction and breast cancer pill Verzenio. Shares were up 25% this year, and they've outperformed the wider sector.]"

WWW is expected to report a decrease in its top line from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure when it releases second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 10 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $583 million for quarterly revenues suggests a fall of 18.3% from the prior-year quarter’s tally.The consensus estimate for the quarterly bottom line has been stable in the past 30 days at 20 cents per share. The figure indicates a sharp decline from earnings of 66 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter.In the trailing four quarters, this Rockford, MI-based player delivered an earnings surprise of 15.1%, on average.Key Factors to NoteWolverine has been battling higher selling, general and administrative expenses for a while now. Also, the macro challenges, including foreign currency headwinds and inflationary pressures, are expected to have been deterrents. The company has been witnessing a soft gross margin for quite some time now. These factors are likely to have hurt its performance in the quarter under review.On its last earnings call, management had forecast revenues of $580 million, reflecting a decline of 13.7% year over year, driven by the challenging trading conditions in the market, across the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. For the second quarter, it had expected a gross margin of about 41% and an operating margin of 6%, comprising $23 million of transitory-inventory costs. The company delivered an adjusted gross margin of 43% and an adjusted operating margin of 11% in the year-earlier quarter. Wolverine had envisioned adjusted earnings per share of 20 cents for the second quarter, down from 66 cents per share earned in the year-earlier quarter.Management had further highlighted the Merrell brand’s revenues to fall in the mid-teens versus the second-quarter 2022 figure, driven by the tough macroeconomic headwinds and year-over-year product flow shifts. It had projected Saucony’s revenues to decline in the mid-single digits and SweatyBetty’s revenues to decrease in the low teens for the second quarter.On the flip side, Wolverine’s commitment to product innovation and investment in digitization appear encouraging. Management has also been strengthening its direct-to-consumer capabilities. Speed-to-market initiatives, deployment of the digital product development tool and expansion of e-commerce platforms are likely to be other positives. Its international business has also been performing well.Story continuesWhat Our Zacks Model SaysOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Wolverine this time around.

8,2cfb8c22-da56-3912-943f-c9a093e6d3ef,USB,2023-08-09,The five-year loss for U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shareholders likely driven by its shrinking earnings,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-loss-u-bancorp-nyse-120048677.html,1691582448,STORY,['USB'],"[It is a pleasure to report that the U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is up 39% in the last quarter. But over the last half decade, the stock has not performed well. After all, the share price is down 24% in that time, significantly under-performing the market.On a more encouraging note the company has added US$3.7b to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the five-year loss for shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the five years over which the share price declined, U.S. Bancorp's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 1.9% each year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 5% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days. The low P/E ratio of 11.51 further reflects this reticence.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of U.S. Bancorp, it has a TSR of -7.6% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveU.S. Bancorp shareholders are down 12% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 6.6%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.5% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with U.S. Bancorp .U.S. Bancorp is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Further, the ratings outlook of Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Northern Trust, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. and Truist Financial have been placed under review for downgrade.Capital One, Citizens Financial, Fifth Third Bancorp, Bank OZK, PNC Financial and Regions Financial are some big names whose outlook was lowered by Moody’s to negative on Monday.The rating agency noted that rising funding costs, potential regulatory capital weakness and heightened risks associated with commercial real estate (CRE) loans on subdued office space demand are putting strain on banks’ profitability.In a note, Moody’s stated, “Many banks' second-quarter results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”Story continuesThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March sparked a regional banking crisis, leading to deposit flight despite regulators’ emergency actions to shore up confidence. The rating agency warns that the current high interest rate environment has made many banks with substantial unrealized losses not reflected in their regulatory capital ratios vulnerable to a loss of confidence.The Federal Reserve increased the interest rates at the fastest pace in decades to contain stubborn inflation, which has slowed down credit demand. Also, a recent Federal Reserve survey data noted that the U.S. banks reported tighter credit standards and muted wholesale and retail loan demand during the second quarter.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Stocks of many of these banks closed down by more than 1%. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) and the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) both dropped more than 1% as well.Moody’s attributed its decisions to a series of pressures making life more difficult for mid-sized financial institutions across the country, from higher deposit costs and eroding profitability to new capital requirements and a commercial real estate slump.The trigger for many of these issues is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to cool inflation with higher interest rates. Moody's said that campaign ""continues to have a material impact on the US banking system’s funding and its economic capital.""""I don't think that the ratings downgrades suggest that there's more weakness coming that we didn't already see,"" JPMorgan US equity strategist Abby Yoder told Yahoo Finance Live, describing what happened as a ""rearview mirror"" look at the sector.The move downward in many regional bank stocks, she added, had more to do with the fact that many of these stocks had rallied in recent weeks.In fact, many investors pushed stocks higher following a series of second quarter earnings that appeared to ease any lingering fears that mid-sized financial institutions faced the sort of existential threat that surfaced in the spring when the failures of three sizable banks triggered outflows across the banking system.Story continuesDeposits were up at most smaller banks, even those that suffered outflows during the first quarter.But there was one troublesome trend that emerged from those second quarter results. Namely, most regional banks attracted more deposits during the quarter by paying a lot more for them, thus cutting into a key measure of profitability.Many, as a result, revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year, including PNC and Truist.Fifth Third also trimmed its full-year forecast range for net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and what they pay for their deposits.""We're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well, and if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings,"" Fifth Third chief executive Tim Spence said last month.The fresh volatility introduced by Moody's may come in handy for regulators as the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency try to sell a complex overhaul of new capital standards for banks.They argue the changes are needed to make lenders stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for shocks like the crisis of this spring.The new capital proposals are expected to face pushback from the banking industry, which argues that lenders are much more resilient than they were during the 2008-09 financial crisis and that higher requirements could restrict lending.Many midsize banks that could be part of these new rules are already making adjustments by holding back on any increases in dividends or share buybacks. Several also are selling assets to reduce the risks on their balance sheets or examining a pullback in certain types of lending.Banks are ""doing the right things,"" Yoder, the JPMorgan equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live, citing the restructuring of balance sheets ahead of new regulatory requirements.Banks will probably be less profitable, but in the long term, she added, ""they will be in better shape.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Moody's has downgraded ten small and medium-sized U.S. banks, including M&amp;T (MTB), Pinnacle (PNFP), Webster Financial (WBS), and issued negative outlook warnings on larger financial bodies like PNC, Capital One (COF), and Citizen's Bank (CFG). Lastly, pharmaceutical developer Eli Lilly (LLY) raises its full-year guidance on the success of its weight-loss and breast cancer drugs. Yahoo Finance Live's Julie Hyman breaks down several of this morning's top headlines.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: UPS shares slump after the delivery giant missed on second quarter revenue and slashed its full-year outlook. Revenue guidance now at around $93 billion this year. That is down from a prior forecast of roughly $97 billion. Much of the hit being put down to the impact of labor negotiations.The UPS and the Teamsters Union reached a tentative deal on a new contract at the end of July. Union members are yet to approve it, however. These results won't come as a huge shock to investors. At the end of April, UPS warned that volume would remain under pressure due to current macro conditions.Moody's has cut its rating on 10 small and mid-sized US banks and warned it could downgrade bigger lenders as well. There were official downgrades for the likes of M&amp;T Bank, Pinnacle, Webster Financial. 11 banks in total were put on a negative outlook including larger lenders like PNC, Capital One and, Citizen's. Those are all falling in premarket trading. Bigger plays like Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp, and State Street are all under review for a potential downgrade.And the good times keep rolling for Eli Lilly. Thanks to a strong drug pipeline, the pharma company upping its full-year guidance after second quarter profit rocketed 85% from a year ago. It now sees full-year revenue landing between $33.4 billion and $33.9 billion, much of the tailwind coming from its type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro which, of course, is also being used off-label for weight reduction and breast cancer pill Verzenio.

(NYSE:CF) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 31st of August, with investors receiving $0.40 per share. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 2.0%, which is around the industry average. View our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings CF Industries Holdings' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Before making this announcement, CF Industries Holdings was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 46.9% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 26%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendCF Industries Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.32 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 17% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that CF Industries Holdings has grown earnings per share at 37% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.CF Industries Holdings Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. To that end, CF Industries Holdings has 2 warning signs (and 1 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about. Is CF Industries Holdings not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

We have also covered some interesting insights about disruptions in industries as a result of AI along with companies that have been at the forefront of these transformations. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Industries Being Revolutionized by AI and Automation Technologies.Global Industrial Automation Market and GrowthAccording to Fortune Business Insights Report, the global industrial automation market was valued at $191.89 billion in 2021 with projected growth of $395.09 billion by 2029 and a CAGR of 9.8%. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary decline of 6.5% in 2020, but automation solutions have proved to be immensely crucial in mitigating its impact. Market players like Emerson Electric, ABB, and Rockwell Automation led the way with innovative technologies. Moreover, the rise of 5G, Industry 4.0, AR, digital twin, and IoT fuels automation demand across sectors. With significant growth prospects, automation remains vital in safeguarding processes, increasing efficiency, and meeting consumer demands in the future.Industries That Have Been Disrupted By AIWith industrial automation growing in an unprecedented manner, AI has disrupted the healthcare sector by catalyzing a rapid digital transformation. From virtual triage to personalized treatments, AI has revolutionized patient care to new heights. Quicker diagnosis is now possible through AI-driven image interpretation, while deep techplatforms or even startups  like Niramai in India can detect breast cancer early using thermography.Moreover, clinical decision-making has been massively improved with AI's assistance in treatment design and genomics studies. Hospitals benefit from AI-based tools that automate their administrative tasks, optimize patient flow, and predict readmissions. On the other hand, patients get to enjoy enhanced experiences with AI assistants guiding them through their healthcare journey. Thus, we see how AI has shifted healthcare towards a digital, patient-centric model, that has not only improved accessibility but also promised efficiency, and preventive care. The future of AI holds even greater potential, as AI continues to empower medical professionals and revolutionize healthcare delivery worldwide.Story continuesTo exemplify, we can look at how Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has leveraged AI in healthcare through two neoteric use cases. First, they developed the Ultreon software, which utilizes AI automation to provide precise micrometer-level medical imaging of arteries in the eye and heart. This AI-enabled technology offers real-time data to physicians during heart stint surgery, streamlining clinical decision-making and leading to better patient outcomes. A study sponsored by Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) revealed that 88% of physicians altered their treatment strategy when using the OCT solution paired with Ultreon which indicated a strong and high demand for this modern imaging platform.Secondly, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) deployed an ML algorithm to predict heart attacks and identify individuals at risk. By harnessing the power of machine learning, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) can potentially save lives by detecting warning signs of heart attacks in advance and thus, enable proactive interventions.AI's impact on the fashion industry has been nothing short of revolutionary as well. With the ability to analyze vast amounts of data, AI has transformed fashion designing by predicting consumer preferences and generating designson its own. It streamlines the design process by automating mundane tasks, that allows designers to focus on their creativity. Virtual prototyping through AI also enables designers to visualize their creations before physical prototyping which saves time and resources.However, it is important to highlight that AI's role goes beyond the design phase. It enhances supply chain management by accurately forecasting demand and optimizing logistics. This efficient supply chain management ensures timely delivery and minimizes waste, that in return promises sustainability. Additionally, AI provides a personalized shopping experience for customers through accurate product recommendations, virtual styling, and AI-powered chatbots that offer real-time assistance.For instance, Levi Strauss &amp; Co (NYSE:LEVI) uses AI to enhance its website and mobile app by providing personalized product recommendations based on consumer data from specific markets. AI is helping Levi Strauss &amp; Co (NYSE:LEVI) customize its stores to cater to the different needs and interests of local consumers which has increased their enrollments, revenues, and app registrations in their loyalty program.Levi Strauss &amp; Co (NYSE:LEVI) has recently announced their partnership with Lalaland.ai which is a digital fashion studio that uses AI to build customized hyper-realistic models of various body types, ages, sizes, and skin tones. Through AI-generated models, Levi Strauss &amp; Co (NYSE:LEVI) aims to supplement human models and diversify their product representations, providing customers with a more inclusive and personalized shopping experience.Moreover, AI aids in inventory management by tracking and predicting inventory levels, preventing stockouts, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Ai has given rise to the groundbreaking technologies of virtual try-ons, style recommendations, and trend predictions that have taken the shopping experience to another level of transformation. Thus, it is not wrong to say that healthcare and fashion are two industries which benefit massively from AI and automation. However, there do exist industries that will not be affected by AI in the near future atleast. They include sectors with plenty of creative work like movie directors, human-centric roles like psychologists and counsellors and skilled trade workers like plumbers or electricians.  Of course, there can be robots made for these jobs, but it will take some time to replace humans completely from these fields. We have also discussed interesting insights in our article related to AI jobs, if you are interested, please head straight to Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.10 Industries Being Revolutionized By AI and Automation TechnologiesCopyright: rawpixel / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe conducted a comprehensive analysis of industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies by exploring various sources on the internet to identify common patterns and trends. After compiling a list of 15 such industries, we ranked them using exposure and consensus scores and the 10 highest ranked were eventually selected.For the exposure score, we relied on MSCI's ranking of estimates for the share of employment exposed to AI automation in each industry. This score indicates how extensively AI and automation are already integrated into the workforce. Here, a higher exposure score equates relatively lower exposure.For the consensus score, we considered input from multiple sources, with Reddit being a key platform where discussions about industries embracing AI and automation frequently occurred. Similarly, the industries with the most mentions and agreement on their automation practices received lower consensus scores. By averaging the exposure and consensus scores, we determined the final ranking.Please note and remember that industries with lower average scores received higher ranks. In case of similar average score, industry with a lower exposure score was ranked higher.Note: For the purpose of this article, we have treated industries and fields alike to to give you a broader perspective.Here is a list of Industries Being Revolutionized by AI and Automation10. HealthcareExposure Score: 10 Consensus Score: 10 Average Score: 10Artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare in the US quite extensively. For instance, Ohio's Hospice introduced an intelligent automation platform, that allowed them to give back 24,000 business hours after the pandemic and achieved six speedy automated processes.Highmark Health also cleared a backlog and processed over 200,000 claims in just five days using AI to ensure that 2.1 million patients' claims were paid. AI-driven digital workers have improved service delivery while coping with mounting workloads, and reduced costs. Digital-first strategies with AI, interoperable analytics, and advanced technologies are driving the future of medicine that put patient care at the heart of healthcare and minimize the long-term health effects caused by postponed services.Healthcare professionals are also some of the most respected professionals in the world with well-deserved high compensation packages around the world, especially in the US.9. RetailExposure Score: 8 Consensus Score: 9 Average Score: 8.5Retail sector has utilized AI to improve customer experiences and optimize operations, making it one of the top industries/fields being impacted by AI. For example, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) utilizes AI to improve customer and employee experiences across its vast network of stores. At Sam's Club, a membership warehouse club by Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), floor scrubbers equipped with AI technology capture real-time images of every item on shelvesthat enables better inventory management and ensure products are in stock. This AI-driven approach helps Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) personalize shopping experiences and streamline operations for increased efficiency and customer satisfaction. Hence, retail is one of the industries currently influenced by AI.8. Computer and MathematicalExposure Score: 9 Consensus Score: 3 Average Score: 6.0While the field of Math isn't particularly an industry in the same sense as others in our list, we've included it because Math plays a fundamental role in many industries dealing with bleeding edge R&amp;D. AI is transforming the field of mathematics, an example is symbolic AI like Lean which is an interactive theorem prover. It enables mathematicians to check and refine proofs more efficiently, while avoiding endless debates. Hence, it is one of the fields being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies. However, the rise of non-symbolic AI, like deep learning and neural networks, presents a divide between mathematicians and AI. While AI can prove theorems and solve complex problems, mathematicians believe their creative capacity sets them apart. This ensures that their roles are secure until AI becomes as creative as humans. Speaking of deep learning, you can also check out article on deep learning courses for high salary jobs.7. Life, Physical, and Social ScienceExposure Score: 4 Consensus Score: 8 Average Score: 6.0In social sciences, AI has the potential to revolutionize research by offering real-time interpretations of human conversations from the internet that also simulates social interactions between individuals, and even substitute human participants in data collection. However, concerns about bias reproduction and misinformation need to be addressed. For instance, large language models like ChatGPT could inadvertently spread false information if users rely solely on confident-sounding but inaccurate outputs.In life sciences, AI has already made significant strides in clinical trials and manufacturing. In silico, clinical trials that are powered by AI have the potential to speed up the drug development process and reduce costs by eliminating the need for living cohorts. In manufacturing, AI streamlines biopharma processes and predicts roadblocks while also identifying quality control issues.6.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Under Armour is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.08 = US$272m ÷ (US$4.9b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Under Armour has an ROCE of 8.0%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Luxury industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for Under Armour roceIn the above chart we have measured Under Armour's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Under Armour.How Are Returns Trending?Under Armour has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 58% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.In Conclusion...To sum it up, Under Armour is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 62% in the last five years. With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Under Armour, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

At the time, the company said it would begin to exit between 2,000 and 3,000 stores in North America and would be in about 10,000 doors by 2022.FN reached out to Under Armour to clarify how much this new wholesale push will change that distribution.The entry into new doors is part of Under Armour’s efforts to lift its sagging U.S. business, which dented its results for the first quarter. Like other footwear brands this quarter, Under Armour’s business in North America was challenged as the region grapples with inventory excesses and conservative orders from wholesale retail partners. Under Armour’s revenue in the region declined 9 percent to $827 million, as part of a broader revenue decline of 2 percent, to $1.3 billion in the first quarter.“There are still inflated levels of inventory that are leading to more promotional activity,” Linnartz said on the call regarding the North American wholesale market. “But as we see the year going on and as we head into next year, we anticipate that things will get better and there will be less need for so much promotional activity.”Story continuesThis recovery, Linnartz said, will be accomplished under the brand’s new Protect This House 3 (PTH 3) plan, a new strategy meant to revamp its business, which involves focusing on reinvigorating brand DNA, key product areas and growing its business in North America. As this strategy progresses, Linnartz said, Under Armour will expand its distribution into new wholesale partners.“As we focus on better product, we’re going to be more disciplined about segmentation. We’re going to open new doors, new partners, including in the wholesale arena,” Linnartz said. “So we’re excited about the long-term strategy and where we’re headed with our partners.”Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic said in a Tuesday note that an entry into new wholesale doors could potentially drive “an inflection domestically” for Under Armour. Other analysts were similarly encouraged by the brand’s potential to recover through the remainder of the year.In the second quarter, Under Armour expects revenue to be between flat and down slightly compared with the prior year, which accounts for a low single-digit decline in North America. Q4 is expected to yield the highest revenue growth rate of the year.Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Walt Disney Company DIS, Townsquare TSQ and On Holding ONON.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Travel is coming back in a big way. It may have taken a couple years after COVID to get here, but finally things are beginning to get back to normal. It’s led to some great profits for companies in the travel and leisure industry. That includes gambling stocks like today’s Bull of the Day. This stock is not only in a strong industry but it’s also one of the strongest stocks in that industry.I’m talking about Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) MGM Resorts International. MGM Resorts International, through its subsidiaries, owns and operates casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts in the United States and Macau. The company operates through three segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China. Its casino resorts offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail, and other resort amenities. The company's casino operations include slots and table games, as well as online sports betting and iGaming through BetMGM.MGM Resorts International is in the Gaming industry which ranks in the Top 28% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Not only does it currently enjoy a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), but it also has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, Growth of A and Momentum of A to help it round out with a VGM Composite Score of A.The reason for the favorable rank is that over the last week, four analysts have increased their estimates for the current year while five have done so for next year. The bullish moves have pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from $2.14 to $2.40 while next year’s number is up from $2.31 to $2.69 over the last 30 days.Story continuesBear of the Day:The market is back within earshot of all-time highs. That means that there are plenty of stocks that are rocketing higher. You may feel like a genius right now, riding the wave. But you have to be careful because when the tide comes in, it could leave you high and dry. One way to put yourself in the best position to succeed is by investing in stocks that have strong earnings trends. Stocks with strong earnings trends tend to stay in the green from a profit perspective longer than those who have their numbers dancing all over the place.One stock that has seen some weakness in its trend is today’s Bear of the Day, DISH Network. DISH Network Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, provides pay-TV services in the United States. The company operates in two segments, Pay-TV and Wireless. It offers video services under the DISH TV brand; and programming packages that include programming through national broadcast networks, local broadcast networks, and national and regional cable networks, as well as regional and specialty sports channels, premium movie channels, and Latino and international programming packages.DISH Network is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The reason for the unfavorable rank is that analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. The bearish moves have pushed down our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $1.38 to $1.22 for the current year while next year’s number is off from $1.03 to 59 cents.The Cable Television industry is currently in the Bottom 13% of our Zacks Industry Rank. There are no stocks in that industry which are in the good graces of our Zacks Rank.Additional content:What's in the Cards for Disney's (DIS) Fiscal Q3 Earnings?The Walt Disney Company is set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 9.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved down by 3% to 99 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating a decrease of 9.17% year over year.The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $22.44 billion, suggesting growth of 4.34% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Notably, Disney’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the remaining quarter, the average surprise being 5.98%.The Walt Disney Company price-eps-surprise | The Walt Disney Company QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderDisney’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect declining Disney+ subscriber growth. Disney+, as of Apr 1, 2023, had 157.8 million paid subscribers compared with 161.8 million as of Dec 31, 2022.Stiff competition from the likes of Amazon prime video and Netflix, as well as the growing prominence of services from Apple, Peacock and HBO Max, is expected to have hurt Disney+’s growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Our model estimate for the number of paid subscribers of Disney+ is currently pegged at 149.8 million, suggesting an 8.8% year-over-year decline.Parks, Experiences and Products businesses are expected to have benefited from strong occupancy.Our model estimate for Parks, Experiences &amp; Consumer Products revenues is currently pegged at $8.06 billion, indicating growth of 13.5% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.Disney has an Earnings ESP of -9.14% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Townsquare has an Earnings ESP of +4.17% and a Zacks Rank #1.

30,ea89f2b0-7438-3708-9cc2-d3a83ae0f32d,NCLH,2023-08-09,3 Travel Stocks Worth Packing in Your Portfolio Right Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-travel-stocks-worth-packing-033342162.html,1691033622,STORY,"['NCLH', 'DAL']","[Investors should have been looking at travel stocks to buy over the last few months, given the move we’ve seen in this group. Whether there’s a recession coming or not, consumers don’t seem to be worried. In fact, the only thing they seem worried about is missing their flight.Stocks for airlines, hotels, cruises, travel websites and more have been exploding higher. The TSA recently screened a record number of travelers. Inflation may still be present, but job growth and wage growth are too, allowing consumers to take that extra vacation or last-minute getaway.Earnings have been rolling in and while the results have been solid, the reactions have been mixed. In many cases, that’s because these stocks have rallied so far, so fast. Either way, we’ve seen a surge in travel stocks. While some investors remain leery of this group, the price action warrants an additional look at the best travel stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s look now at three of the best travel stocks available, in my opinion.Delta Air Lines (DAL)Delta airlines aircraft interior full of passengers. Why are so many flights overbooked?Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) really put on a show earlier this year. At one point, shares rallied in 15 straight days. From May 25 to June 15, the stock didn’t have one daily close in the red. That finally came on June 16 when it fell all of 0.21%.Ultimately, Delta stock went on an eight-week win streak and climbed more than 50% from its May low to the July high.In that mix, the stock reported earnings. While shares did not react well to the news — falling just 0.5% on the day but fading over 4% from the highs — the report was quite good. The company delivered an earnings and revenue beat with “record revenue in the June quarter” and upbeat, solid guidance.Now, DAL stock is trading in the key $45 area. That was a major breakout point for the stock, while shares are also testing into the 10-week moving average. If the stock can hold the $43 to $44 level, a rebound back to the 2023 highs could be in play.Story continuesNorwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH)NCL, NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE (NCHL) SHIP GETAWAY, 13 July 2017 : Cruise liner Getaway are docked in Port of Sant Petersburg.Source: Nazar Skladanyi / Shutterstock.comAll of the cruise stocks have been trading well, but Norwegian Cruise Lines (NYSE:NCLH) caught my eye.Norwegian lags its two main peers in various stock performance measures over the last few months. However, just because Carnival Cruise (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) have performed better doesn’t mean Norwegian should be snubbed.The stock recently had a negative reaction to earnings, falling about 12% on Aug. 1. However, shares traded right down into the $17.50 region and bounced after it found the prior breakout level and the 50-day moving average.As long as it holds the 10-week moving average, bullish investors have a solid technical reason to own this name. The valuation is actually somewhat reasonable too, as shares trade at roughly 24 times earnings, but earnings are forecast to more than double this year and next year. If those estimates come to fruition, NCLH stock seems undervalued at 12 times 2024 earnings.Airbnb (ABNB)Woman holding mobile phone with the Airbnb logo on the screenSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) seems to be flying under the radar, but after a two-month 38.5% rally, I’m not so sure that should be the case.The stock has been on fire, slowly but surely grinding its way higher. The inconspicuous rally has not stood out to investors who haven’t been looking for travel stocks. The one hang up could be earnings.The firm is expected to report on Thursday Aug. 3. The announcements could either ignite shares higher and keep this rally going, or it could result in a sell-the-news reaction. While it’s hardly a large sample size, investors sold Delta and Norwegian lower on earnings. If they do that to Airbnb stock, investors should keep an eye on the downside.A break of $145 could usher in the $135 to $140 area, where the stock would find its 10-week and 21-day moving averages. A slightly deeper dip could put the mid- to high-$120s in play, which was a prior breakout area and where the 50-day moving average currently sits. On the upside, a move back over $150 and the current 2023 high of $154.95 could set the stage for a rally to the $167 zone.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

[EIA/S]""The draws in refined products continue to be bullish for the oil market,"" said Andrew Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.Markets largely shrugged off a higher-than-expected 5.85 million-barrel build in U.S. crude stocks after a record drawdown the week before.The U.S. fuel stock drawdown helped offset some demand concerns after Chinese data on Tuesday showed crude oil imports in July fell 18.8% from the previous month to their lowest daily rate since January.China's consumer sector also fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand.Supporting prices, however, were top exporter Saudi Arabia's plans to extend its voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels per day for another month to include September. Russia also said it would cut oil exports by 300,000 bpd in September.""The latest recovery is mainly driven by the pledge of major producers, like Saudi Arabia and Russia, to keep supply subdued for another month,"" said Charalampos Pissouros, senior investment analyst at broker XM.Crude posted its sixth consecutive weekly gain last week, helped by a reduction in OPEC+ supplies and hopes of stimulus boosting oil demand recovery in China.Story continuesOn Tuesday, Saudi Arabia's cabinet said it reaffirmed its support for precautionary measures by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, to stabilise the market, state media reported.Markets will also closely watch July's U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), due on Thursday, which is expected to show a slight year-over-year acceleration.(Additional reporting by Alex Lawler in London, Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo and Andrew Hayley in Beijing; Editing by Paul Simao, Kirsten Donovan and Cynthia Osterman)]"

The reading pointed to more economic headwinds for the world’s largest oil importer.Brent oil futures fell 0.2% to $86.03 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.2% to $82.76 a barrel by 22:23 ET (02:23 GMT).Crude prices had settled higher after a whipsaw session on Tuesday, as a positive outlook for the U.S. economy helped somewhat offset concerns over slowing economic growth and oil demand in China.The prospect of tighter oil supplies this year, especially following bumper supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, kept prices trading close to four-month highs.But data pointing to an unexpected build in weekly U.S. inventories raised some questions over just how much supplies will tighten in the coming months.Strength in the U.S. dollar, ahead of key inflation data due on Thursday, also weighed on oil prices.Chinese inflation weakens further in JulyChinese consumer price index inflation slid into negative territory for the first time since September 2021, data showed on Wednesday. Producer price index inflation also shrank for a 10th straight month, amid worsening economic conditions in the country.While month-on-month CPI inflation showed some signs of improvement, it was still well below healthy levels, indicating that economic weakness in the world’s largest oil importer was unlikely to improve in the near-term.The soft inflation readings follow data on Tuesday which showed that Chinese oil imports also tumbled through July. This in turn fueled more doubts over a recovery in Chinese oil demand this year.U.S. inventories unexpectedly riseData from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories grew by over 4 million barrels in the week to July 28, much more than expectations for a draw of 0.2 million barrels.Story continuesThe build comes after inventories saw their biggest draw on record in the week to July 21, of over 17 million barrels.But the unexpected build for last week showed that U.S. fuel demand may now be winding down, as the end of the summer season approaches.Official inventory data from the Energy Information Administration is now due later in the day, and is expected to show a draw of 0.2 million barrels.Related ArticlesOil prices dip on surprise U.S. inventory build, weak China inflationGold prices hit 1-mth low, copper sinks as risk-off favors dollarBiden moves to protect vast sacred lands near Grand Canyon]"

(NYSE:CRM) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Salesforce The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SalesforceThe Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$105m worth of shares at a price of US$211 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$212). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 1.8% of Marc Benioff's stake.In the last year Salesforce insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Salesforce Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Salesforce. In total, Co-Founder Marc Benioff sold US$105m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of SalesforceMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Salesforce insiders own about US$6.3b worth of shares (which is 3.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Salesforce Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Salesforce stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Salesforce.But note: Salesforce may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

RBC's Lori Calvasina said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above) in the wake of her latest research. ""I'm just not seeing it yet. Maybe I'll get it later this year, but not right now.""Calvasina pointed to several reasons behind her growing concern about the near-term market outlook.First, rising earnings estimates for S&amp;P 500 companies is a phenomenon that has largely played out this year.Investors usually race to buy stocks when analysts are lifting profit and cash flow forecasts on companies. Remember, the present value of a stock price reflects expectations of future cash flow.This ""important catalyst"" for markets is in the rearview mirror, Calvasina said.Second, investors may be too optimistic about the outlook for the US economy in 2024 leading to a strong reacceleration in earnings growth.As it stands, economic indicators ranging from the July jobs report to various manufacturing surveys haven't supported that optimism.A pedestrian walks near a worker directing traffic on a construction site in central Sydney, Australia, June 7, 2017. (REUTERS/Jason Reed) (Jason Reed / reuters)And lastly, Calvasina said, the looming presidential election in 2024 is a ""source of uncertainty"" for the stock market.Calvasina explained investors are beginning to grow worried about the potential for another contentious race for the White House — and may head for the exit in the near term.To be sure, the broader market is showing signs of fatigue as investors wade through the dog days of summer and assess above-average valuations as well as Fitch's US credit rating downgrade.The hottest trades of 2023 — namely those in the AI space — have come under pressure in August, for starters.C3.ai (AI) is down 8% in August, Salesforce (CRM) is off by 4%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2%, and Nvidia (NVDA) has lost 3%.Story continuesIn a new research note on Monday, BTIG technical strategist Jonathan Krinsky called out that the S&amp;P 500 has dipped below its 45-day moving average.

I will now turn the call over to Ted. Operator, please turn to Slide 3. Ted?Story continuesEdward L. DohenyThank you, Brian, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide updates on our 2023 outlook and our continuous journey to Reinvent SEE from the best in packaging to a world-class company, automating sustainable packaging solutions. We're introducing a new program called Cost take-out to Grow as part of our Reinvent SEE 2.0 to return to growth and take out our cost in this challenging post-COVID environment. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Starting with Slide 3. On this chart, we show our adjusted EBITDA performance since 2017 through the lens of major episodic events. The chart recaps where we are today, but most importantly, where we are going and how we're repositioning for future growth. We'd like to give you visibility to what we see for 2024 through 2025 and set the stage for a Cost take-out to Grow program. As we entered 2018, we were faced with major challenges such as the start of War on Plastics and remaining stranded costs after the Diversey sale. The company's operating leverage and earnings power were not where we wanted to be, and our stock price had been stagnant for the previous 3 years. That was the case for action to launch our Reinvent SEE program based on our 4P'S. We established the SEE operating model, setting the tone for a transformation to world-class. The Reinvent SEE growth strategy centered on the pillars of automation, digital, and sustainability. Through Reinvent SEE, we realized annual savings over $300 million, margin expansion greater than 270 basis points and 5% top line growth, including M&amp;A. In early 2020, COVID shook the world and profoundly impacted the way of life globally. COVID brought demand surges in e-commerce and food retail caused wide supply chain disruptions, rapid inflation, product shortages and overstocking. We built Reinvent SEE aiming to become world-class based on our 4P'S: people, performance, products, processes and sustainability. Last quarter, we introduced our new SEE corporate brand, highlighting our transformation into an automation, digital, and sustainability packaging solutions company. We are now evolving Reinvent SEE 2.0 to growth and expand the cost take-out and productivity program to $140 million to $160 million of annual savings to be fully realized by the end of 2025. This Cost take-out to Grow program will redirect SEE resources from crisis problem solving to focus on driving major growth opportunities. We are transforming SEE go-to-market team to an efficient and effective solutions-focused organization, accelerating automation across our business verticals and launching new product innovations enabled by sustainable materials and digital solutions. We will increase the operating leverage and earnings power in the business by further optimizing our supply chain footprint and driving digitally-enabled SG&amp;A productivity improvements. Bringing it all together, with our Cost take-out to Grow, we are targeting low single digit growth, fueling our SEE operating engine, which will result in margin expansion in our journey to world class. Now moving to Slide 4. We'd like to showcase how we are creating high-quality growth. We break down our growth by geography, market, product, and MySEE, our online digital platform. In the second quarter, our digital online transactions grew to 16% of total company sales, representing a sequential increase from approximately 10% in Q4 of 2022 and approximately 14% in Q1 of 2023. This rapid growth reflects the speed of our digital transformation, our ability to adapt to changing needs of our customers, enabling us to serve customers we are not efficiently reaching today. Towards the bottom of the slide, you can see the current percent of online transactions for each of our business verticals. Our largest penetration is in our Automated Protective Solutions business. Starting with Consumer Ready solutions, representing over 50% of total revenue. These solutions are designed to meet the evolving needs of food processors, retailers and brand owners as they seek to respond to shifting consumer preferences and to create an at-home experience. In the second quarter, Consumer Ready Solutions declined low single digit in volume, primarily driven by softer demand in our processors in food, retail end markets. The rapid increase in inflation over the past several quarters has impacted discretionary spending, resulting in decelerating market demand. Consumers are trading down from premium to lower-priced proteins. This dynamic impacted all regions with EMEA being hit the hardest. SEE Automation solutions for proteins continue to be a bright spot and grew approximately 40% from strong share gains with major meat processors in the quarter. Despite the softer global protein market, Automation grew double digits in all regions with APAC showing the strongest momentum growing greater than 50%. Throughout 2023 and into 2024, we expect the retail softness to continue. The U.S. cattle cycle will be a headwind for the business, partially offset by tailwinds from the Australian herd cycle, which already positively impacted our business. Automation will continue to be a secular driver across all these markets. The next business vertical, Fluids and Liquids now representing greater than 10% of company sales in the quarter experienced mid-single-digit growth before counting Liquibox. We continue to see the modest food service recovery and strong growth in Automation. We're bringing medical into this business vertical further capturing the synergy between CRYOVAC's material science and Liquibox' fitment and attachment technologies. Our third business vertical is our Automated Protective Solutions, which represents approximately 35% of our business today, focusing on a variety of markets and customers ranging from industrials to e-commerce fulfillment. Weak end market demand and channel destocking continued to impact volume performance in the quarter. We're focusing our efforts on turning around this vertical by expanding SEE Automation capabilities and fiber-based solutions. We're increasing engagement and reaching more customers through our MySEE digital platform, now representing approximately 35% of this vertical's revenue. We're actively performing a strategic review of our protective portfolio for further areas to optimize and unlock value. As a small example, we recently announced the closure of our Kevothermal, temperature assurance business. Transitioning now to Slide 5. We delve into SEE's growth pillars, namely automation, digital, and sustainability, all crucial in addressing our customers' most pressing packaging challenges. During the second quarter, we reached new significant milestones, demonstrating our commitment to our customers in delivering incremental value-add capabilities to enable profitable growth for SEE. Automation exhibited robust growth for the quarter, increasing by approximately 20%. Food automation was particularly strong up approximately 40% year-over-year from continued market share gains at major protein producers. We anticipate delivering over $525 million, up 10% in annual revenue this year. With regards to digital solutions, we achieved several significant milestones. As an example of how digital printing is fueling SEE Automation, we introduced a new prismiq digital printer unit to print protein bags at our customers' facilities, enabling them to customize their products at the point of packaging. Transactions on MySEE platform surpassed $1 billion annual run rate in the second quarter, demonstrating robust digital engagement. Following the successful introduction of our online design studio, onboarded customers experienced high-speed web-to-print solutions, streamlined graphics process and reduced print lead times. As we move more of the company online, we continue to unlock operational efficiencies, reach new customers and make it easier to do business with SEE. On the sustainability front, we're proud to share that our MSCI and Sustainalytics ratings have improved, recognizing our ESG progress. Back in July, together with ExxonMobil Australia, we announced a unique circularity initiative for protein trace. The collaboration will avert more than 900 tons of plastic waste annually from landfills or incineration. We take great pride in the industry partnerships we've created to deliver scalable and sustainable solutions, making our world better than we find it. Turning to Slide 6. This is another example of how the combination of best-in-class CRYOVAC auto pouch equipment and film, Liquibox dispensing technologies and prismiq digital connectivity bring value and create customer returns. On the top right-hand side of the slide, you see the use of CRYOVAC technology barrier bags filling lemonade within a quick service restaurant environment. This automated form, fill, and seal solution enables greater than 2x operational efficiency and over 30% waste reduction compared with traditional back of the store lemons, slicing and squeezing, improved speed of service, reduces storage requirements, enhances safety while offering a seamless source of fresh lemonade throughout a given day. In this example, the operational savings were over $10 million for the customer. We're introducing a new solution designed not only to bring additional operational savings, but also create new revenue sources for QSR brand owners, a prefilled fresh lemonade, bag in the box can replace carryout rigid plastic jugs for quick service restaurants. This growth opportunity for our customers extend shelf life from hours to days, enables in-store retail carryout formats and digital marketing opportunities to enhance consumer experience. This application will disrupt rigid containers with an improved sustainability profile through less and more efficient packaging. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dustin to review our financial results. Dustin?Dustin J. SemachThank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Now moving to second quarter's results. Let's turn to Slide 7. In the quarter, on a constant currency basis, net sales were down 1% and adjusted EBITDA of $280 million was down 5% compared to last year. Volumes were relatively flat sequentially, excluding M&amp;A effects, reflecting volume stabilization since the beginning of the year. Sequentially, EBITDA improved about 5% from $267 million in the first quarter of 2023, partially driven by improved sequential volumes and cost reduction. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.80 was down 22% compared to a year ago on a constant currency basis but increased 8% sequentially from $0.74 in the first quarter of 2023. Turning to Slide 8. Liquibox contributed 5% to top line sales of approximately $75 million was more than offset by organic declines driven by continued market pressures and customer destocking in Protective as well as continued weakness in food (inaudible). Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $280 million, which included [$19] million contribution from Liquibox, decreased [$13] million or 4% compared to last year with margins of 20.3%, down 40 basis points. This performance was mainly driven by lower volumes within Protective. As it relates to adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of $0.80, our adjusted tax rate was 26.9% compared to 24.7% in the same period last year. We did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of 2023 was 144.8 million. Moving to Slide 9. In the second quarter, food net sales of $881 million were up 3% on an organic basis, primarily driven by price realization. Volume was flat year-over-year with growth in Automation in our organic Fluids and Liquids business offset by continued weakness in retail demand. Volume was slightly up versus the first quarter. Food adjusted EBITDA of $191 million in the second quarter was up 16% in constant dollars compared to last year, with margins at 21.7%, up 90 basis points, mainly due to the contribution from Liquibox and lower operating costs, partially offset by unfavorable net price realization of $10 million. Protective second quarter net sales of $500 million were down 18%, driven by volume declines in all regions from continued market pressures in industrial, electronics and fulfillment markets and continued customer destocking activities. While we expect destocking activities to moderate, headwinds in end market demand are projected to continue in the second half. Protective adjusted EBITDA of $96 million was down 24% in constant dollars in the second quarter with margins at 19.2%, down 140 basis points due to lower volumes and associated operational leverage, partially offset by favorable net price realization of $11 million. Sequentially, EBITDA margins improved 300 basis points primarily driven by favorable net price realization and cost control. On Slide 10, we review our second quarter net sales by segment and by region. In constant dollars, net sales were down 1%, with 12% growth in Food, while Protective was down 18%. By region, we grew APAC by 6%, offset by a decline of 2% in Americas and EMEA being flat. Now let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 11. Through the second quarter, free cash flow was a use of cash of $130 million compared to $94 million source of cash in the same period a year ago. Working capital has improved through our continued efforts to reduce inventory. However, benefits were offset by the previously disclosed deposit Internal Revenue Service of $175 million. Excluding the impact of IRS deposit, free cash flow would have been a source of cash of $45 million. On Slide 12, we outlined our purpose-driven capital allocation strategy focused on maximizing value for our shareholders. As anticipated, we closed out the second quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 4.1x. We expect to use free cash flow generation to delever throughout the year and into 2024. We are working to optimize our portfolio and actively addressing opportunities to unlock value. Let's turn to Slide 13 to review our 2023 outlook. Our guidance at the beginning of the year anticipated a V-shaped recovery in the second half of full year 2023. Based on continued end market demand weakness, compounded by destocking, we expect an L-shape recovery through 2023 and into 2024, reflecting a post-COVID lower growth environment. As a result, we are revising our full year guidance, which includes the following. We expect net sales to be in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion, which at the midpoint is down 3% on a reported basis and down 7% organically. We now expect Liquibox to contribute approximately $300 million in sales for 2023. Second half will be similar to the first half of 2023, reflecting volume stabilization throughout the year, the slight uptick in volumes in the fourth quarter. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.125 billion, which assumes adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.95. We expect full year 2023 free cash flow, excluding the previously disclosed tentative tax settlement to be in the range of $325 million to $375 million, which implies a free cash flow conversion of approximately 85% at the midpoint. Lastly, for the third quarter of 2023, we expect net sales to be in the range of $1.360 billion to $1.380 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be $260 million to $270 million with an earnings per share of between $0.60 and $0.64 per share. As Ted mentioned earlier, due to the current environment, we launched Cost take-out to Grow as part of Reinvent 2.0 to restore earnings and volume growth in 2024 and beyond. I look forward to giving you more details and updating you on the progress to the $140 million to $160 million of annual savings targeted by the end of 2025 and our growth initiatives on subsequent earnings calls. With that, let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks. Ted, over to you.Edward L. DohenyThanks, Dustin. As we look to the remainder of 2023 and into 2024, the combination of Reinvent SEE 2.0 initiatives and new product introductions will help us revert to low single digit growth. We continue to be cautious on the global economic outlook and lingering impact of inflation. We are confident that our Cost take-out to Grow program will put us back to the earnings growth path and position us to address significant opportunities in our end markets. I also want to take a moment to recognize our people. Their hard work and dedication to relentlessly drive our company to world-class performance. With that, I open the call for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.Matthew T. KruegerThis is Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. Thanks for taking my question and for all the details. I was hoping that you could provide some added detail on your volume expectations by segment for the second half of 2023. Your guidance appears to imply a slowdown in Food in addition to the weakness in Packaging. Why would this be the case versus the second quarter? And what were the volume run rates for each of the businesses during July? And if you even want to break out some of those details by subsegment, that would be great.Dustin J. SemachMatt, this is Dustin speaking. Great question. So a couple of points. We highlighted and you go back to some of the prepared remarks, starting with Food. If you think about the second half of the year, what you're really looking at is a shift in the U.S. cattle cycle since the beginning of the year, starting in Q2 and now going throughout the remaining portion of the year. It's being partially offset to some degree with what's happening in Australia herd cycle as well, but not fully. And so that's what -- that market impact is compounding volume in the second half as it relates to Food. Keep in mind, holistically though, if you think about the business from first half to second half in Food and Protective, you're looking at general volume stabilization. If you move to Protective, looking at the second half, we talked about we're still seeing end market weakness in demand. And then that's being compounded by obviously destocking. So the longer -- the weaker the demand in our end markets, if [you're not getting] in the destocking cycle, you're seeing that extend into Q3 as well as the compounding market. So those 2 factors were driving high single digit declines in the second half for Protective from a volume perspective.OperatorOur next question comes from Lawrence De Maria from William Blair.Lawrence Tighe De MariaAs much I want to ask about some of the growth opportunities, I would like to understand some of the volume declines in terms of market declines versus, let's say, switching share losses and some of the trade downs. So can you kind of discuss the volume of market declines versus destocking in the second half? And what kind of share losses there potentially are and have you lost any share due to pricing actions?Dustin J. SemachAll right, Larry, this is Dustin Semach. I'll start off, and then Ted can chime in. So if you look at kind of going back to the prior question as well, I'll go up by segment, Larry. So if you look at Food, what we're seeing is -- volume holistically, right, think of it as down in the roughly 4% range in the second half of the year. You have a little bit of uptick in price slightly because we see this more of a year-over-year comp. And then when you look at market, it's down about 4% holistically. There's -- we're looking at share loss to about down 1 point and that's being offset to some degree in our other growth areas. And I'll let Ted come back to that point because I'll move to Protective quickly. When you come back to Protective in the second half of the year, we're seeing more pressure on price. You're seeing that on the commodity resin side really coming from the first half. So you see price down about 3% holistically in the second half with volume down high single digit, of which about half of it is market, the other 25, 30 points is destocking and the rest is going to be share loss offset by some growth. And I'll turn it to Ted to talk a little bit about the growth in each area.Edward L. DohenySure. And picking up on the share loss piece, if we look -- talk to Food first, we talked about what's happening with the resins. We feel like we've got that stabilizing, but we did still have a little carryover for the resin with our customers who we did lose because we didn't have the resin converting those back, they got to get rid of the stock that they have. Market slowing is slowing that down a bit into the third quarter. We think we should have that hopefully gained back by the end of the year. The other part on the share gain is with the automation driving some of our growth. On the Food side, as we shared pretty strong, really have a great backlog. We got some of that pickup. We got some of the part shortages we had that we talked about in the Food business alone, up 40%, still driving to 10% growth for the year and into next year. Some of the activity on the automation, we're working on new products. And right now, with our customers being under strain, they're reducing their CapEx, we're kind of fighting that right now, helping them, calling in, what can we do to help them with their productivity issues, we still think automation has opportunities for us on Food in the second half and going in strong into next year. On the Protective side, the share gain really is -- the pressure we've been seeing is with the destocking, we're seeing that reduced but still strong in the quarter. We still think we'll have more of that in the second half, but that the fiber -- the plastic, the fiber push is still there. We're working on that. That will be playing out through the rest of the year. So we do see some stabilization in the Protective side. Same thing on the growth with Protective, we really think going with our e-commerce platform, getting better reach, getting -- reaching more customers also with the fiber-based solutions coming on board and also the automation, as you saw on the prepared remarks, we have some significant opportunities moving on the Protective side coming in the second half. But right now, the first half of the year is tough, second and half year going to stabilize and building into next year.OperatorOur next question is from George Staphos from BofA Securities.George Leon StaphosThanks for the details. My question is a 2-parter combining the volume outlook with the savings on CTO2Grow. Ultimately, what should be the cadence on the $140 million to $160 million savings that you spell out on Slide 3? And how pressure-tested are they, Ted, to the volume outlook? And the reason I ask, and this is kind of the second question, some of the issues that you cite here in the back half of the year, the cattle cycle, automation, perhaps not growing as quickly because your customers are holding back CapEx. These are factors that were talked about in past quarters and the company's view was they shouldn't be that big of a deal. So are your customers -- does Sealed Air need to get close -- or SEE need to get closer to its customers to have maybe a better view on the volume outlook and in turn, how that will ultimately play into the savings and the cadence there. Good luck in the quarter.Edward L. DohenyGeorge, good question. Let me let Dustin start with just unpacking some of those numbers, and then I will answer the question about how close we are to our customers and why we had that demand shift from first quarter to second quarter.Dustin J. SemachThank you, Ted, and thank you, George. So to quickly answer that question, I just want to take a step back and talk about Reinvent SEE, right? Just as a reminder, is we're announcing the $140 million to $160 million outlook over the next couple of years through 2025. Going back to Reinvent SEE 1.0, the initial kind of commitment was roughly $225 million, which resulted in over $370 million in savings. And the point to make there is that as we move throughout the markets beyond '23 and into '24, we're going to continue to focus on taking out (inaudible) amount of cost and driving the necessary amount of savings to continue to restore earnings power. But going back to the $140 million to $160 million, so if you think about the cadence about -- there will be -- you'll see this begin to feather in, in Q3 and Q4. We're already off and running. The teams are actively engaged and executing as we speak. And then what you're going to see is 60%, 70% of that $150 million at the midpoint appear in 2024 and the remaining portion in 2025. Now I'll turn it back to you, Ted.Edward L. DohenyYes. And then so George, to the second part of the question about being close to our customers. Going through this right now, extremely close to our customers right now with the pressure especially in the Food side, where they've seen the demand change. You can hear with some of our larger customers are announcing publicly what's going on with their demand reduction for the year, so we are side by side. We're seeing that feeling that or look one quarter later, we have much greater visibility to what we see, and that's where you see the adjustment in the second half. To the second part of your question, the automation has been part one, releasing what we had in the backlog, getting that strong growth in the first half, we [feel] the pipeline is still strong. We've been reducing the bookings. The pipeline is still quite strong to get and we have to get those converted. What we're fighting with is with their reduction in demand and the reduction of their heavy intense focus on cost reduction is how can we come in and help them take their cost out through automation, and that's the issue that we're going through right now to build up our backlog for the end of this year and going strong into 2024. We feel pretty good about that on the automation side that we can hit. We have some work to do, but we think the automation is really strong, bright spot for us going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Roxland from Truist Securities.Michael Andrew RoxlandTed, in fluids, you mentioned i think quarter and the prior quarter about your confidence in regaining lost volumes -- Food volumes from last year. How much additional progress have you made in 2Q? And can you also talk about your approach in Food on a go-forward basis? One of your larger competitors recently acquired a food packaging business targeting modular vacuum packaging solutions for protein, dairy, and it tends to increase its food packaging volumes to gain market share. So I just wanted to find out how you're going to address that increase in competitiveness.Edward L. DohenySo the first part, how we're feeling comfortable building on what I just said before, we are with our customers directly. So again, feel pretty confident on the automation on what we're doing with the customers in the Food space. On the resin piece, which is a different subject as we regain where we didn't have that resin in the past, we feel very good with our customers, with our brand, with our service that we can get that business back. Again, we have to get them to deplete the inventory they have with someone else. So feel really good about that at one, even myself personally being engaged with those customers, let's go get that business. The second part of your question with what our competitors doing in automation, part of our growth in automation being well above the market has been taking share. So we feel really good about that. We talked about in the fourth quarter, we had a major conversion with one of our largest customers, actually taking that business back that we lost over 5 years ago. We got that back, making gains. We have some of that equipment in place, actually have it on one of the slides of the new equipment that we brought in. So we feel very good about that. We feel like we have the best products. We feel like we have the best equipment. We have new designs coming in place, so feel really good about it. We'll always have competition. But I feel very good with our CRYOVAC incredible brand with our customers, we have the product, we can go get the business. We have a tremendous sales and service team. So we feel quite confident giving the team better tools, I think we're in a good place despite what the competition is doing.OperatorNext question next question is from Phil Ng with Jefferies.Philip H. NgDustin did a great job in talking about the cost element of your restructuring effort. So Ted, help us kind of think through perhaps the growth side of things. How long do you think these initiatives will take hold we'll see it on the bottom line? And some of the challenges you're calling out on volumes seem like it could linger into 2024. So just curious, what's your level of confidence in getting back to growth from a top line and earnings perspective when we look out to 2024?Edward L. DohenyGreat question. And -- but I'll have to share because Dustin did take the cost out and there saw already some of the lines where I've used -- it's been great having Dustin here, a clean set of eyes, and I've used the phrase already for my mom, ""A new broom sweeps clean."" So what you see there on our Cost take-out to Grow building on the success of Reinvent, we have really good line of sight. What he didn't say is we will continue to under promise and over deliver on those savings. So on the growth element, if you look at the curve on Slide 3, that is where we put a tremendous part of our resources taking care of that COVID period. We originally called out the COVID crisis. We've gone through so many crisises around the world, our scientists, our engineering team, our service technicians, taking care of that bump that was out there, we redirected resources to take care of business. And actually, we had to redesign products that we already had. So to answer your question on my confidence, can we bring -- get us back to growth as we put in the slide committing to low single-digit growth, our internal plans are above that single-digit growth. So how do we do that? You already -- we talked about inorganic with Liquibox. 5.5% growth is coming in there as we drive our largest -- our fastest growing, highest margin segment, so we feel really good about that. How are we doing on automation on the growth going forward? Feel very good. That's got to be north to double digit right now so far this year, quite strong going out? Yes. The digital solutions are just coming into fruition. Going again that hump that the COVID crisis behind us, putting our engineers on our digital solutions, feel really good about that. And then breaking out the fourth area of those new products, again, designing for this new curve on Reinvent 2.0, we have new trays coming out, new fiber-based products coming out. We now have to have those realized to beat that low single digit volume growth out there. So again, under promise, just like on the cost side, we're going to beat that on the growth side, I have high confidence we're going to beat that going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo.Gabrial Shane HajdeMaybe I'll ask the question a little bit differently. I'm honing in on Slide #3, where you talk about CTO2Grow, enabling you to get low single digit volume growth. And then further on the right-hand side of the slide, you talk about sales growth of 5% to 7%. So I'm assuming implied in there is some gross price as well as acquisition-related growth. So I guess in the near term, given that you're focused on deleveraging, M&amp;A tends to be fairly lumpy, is it safe to say that you're assuming that you'll get back to some sort of contribution from net or gross price in that algorithm? And I guess just to clarify on the guidance, you're calling down, I think, Liquibox to be $50 million lower in revenue. What's driving that? And does that come back in 2024 and beyond?Dustin J. SemachOkay. So great question. I'll comment first on net price. And then the comments you made around Cost take-out to Grow and you see on this chart on Slide 3, that kind of course correction. So what we're calling right now is the $140 million to $160 million of annual savings through 2025. And if you think about that line, that dotted line, that's what it represents, okay? And then low single digit growth during that period. And to your point, if you call it, if you look at capital allocation, we are focused in the short term on deleveraging, right? So that's an organic number we're pointing out. In general, we can see net price realization somewhat, I would say, negative, excluding Cost take-out to Grow, right, for the next couple of years, and we talked about that in terms of where resin pricing is at today, where end market demand that holistically was driving that kind of short-term view on pricing, an idea is that when we get through that curve into 2025, that will enable us to get back on over to the right-hand side because our balance sheet will be much further leverage. Pricing environment, markets will be in a different place, and then we're able to get back on to our SEE operating model, which you can see on the bottom right-hand corner.Edward L. DohenyYes. The second part, Gabe, this is Ted, where you mentioned about the Liquibox. Liquibox being right now a step down from what we talked about before, the short issues coming in a quarter into the business. We've had operational issues right now into the quarter. We had some quality issues. We feel like we're on top of that. We brought the CRYOVAC team in there to fix it. We've even had some personnel issues in the plants. We've adjusted rates. I believe we have that fixed and on top of -- we've also, with our customers, they've seen the slowdown in the market, so we've been face-to-face with our team, our CRYOVAC team with the Liquibox team and we think we have some significant opportunities. Right now in the short term there, those are issues, and that's why we took that number down for the year. But the last one on the cost synergy, though, we're actually ahead. Even though the volumes are down, we are ahead on the cost synergies there in the model. And so we get the volumes back up, [where we] think we'll far exceed the cost synergies on the Liquibox. Going into '24, '25 and '26, that is definitely part of getting back to the growth algorithm with the growth in Liquids and Fluids business, so we're still quite confident about that.OperatorOur next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS.Joshua David SpectorI guess one thing I wanted to ask about was more on the cost side, specifically margins within Protective. You had a pretty nice step up in 2Q on flat sales sequentially. So just wondering kind of on your expectations for second half, I think you talked about pricing down, but price net of cost, I guess, could that be up? And if margins improve, do you think you could actually see Protective earnings up year-over-year in the fourth quarter? Or is that too aggressive?Dustin J. SemachGreat question, Josh. And so as we mentioned earlier, 2 points or a couple of different dynamics that I'll call out. One is, if you think about the second half of the year, we're talking about volume stabilization. Having that volume stabilization sequentially coming from the first half really gives us an opportunity as we think about cost control, which benefited in Q2 and would Cost take-out to Grow, benefiting further. And what I haven't really splitly said, but I will say now, which is $140 million to $160 million, obviously, with Protective in-house performed in the first half of the year and really the back half of '22, a lot of those cost savings will actually proportionally be focused on our Protective segment holistically. If you think about the second half and to your point, you are going to have margins sitting in the high teens roughly for the -- think of it as the first for Q3. And by the time you get to Q4 on an absolute dollar basis, you should be very similar to where Protective was in Q4 of 2022.Edward L. DohenyThe only thing to add on that on the growth side of looking at the Protective is the portfolio we did highlight in the prepared remarks. The continued portfolio review and actually changing that portfolio, we will -- we are planning to have margin expansion by the shift in the product mix going into the second half of the year. Also with the new products coming in and in automation will be driving a different mix in the volume. So we should have, again, margin expansion in the second half. That's what we're planning on.OperatorOur next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets.Arun Shankar ViswanathanSo if we look at the midpoint of the guidance, let's say, $1.1 billion for this year and the second -- implying kind of like a $553 million number for the second half. So yes, you're exiting at kind of that $1.1 billion rate. You will be facing some pretty easy comps next year in Protective. I think Food also as far as the back half maybe is positioned out in a little bit better way as well. How do you think about growth next year? Do you envision returning to that SEE operating model growth level of EBITDA maybe in the in the mid- to high upper single-digit range? And what are the risks to keep in mind that would prevent you from getting to that range?Edward L. DohenyHow about if we take [Tin] on the answer because we have the new CFO with readjusting with the CTO2Grow, and then I'll add some color on how it gets back to the model.Dustin J. SemachAbsolutely. So Arun, again, I really appreciate the question. A couple of comments I would make. As we think about next year, right, volume growth is critical. If you think about restoring earnings and that's part of the reason we talk about CTO2Grow is really both sides of the coin, getting back to low single digit volume growth and then restoring our earnings. If we get back to low single digit volume growth, we believe the Cost take-out to Grow program will run earnings growth ahead of overall top line growth. At that point, it won't get back to quite, I'd say, mid- to high single digits for 2024, but anticipating kind of mid-single-digit-ish relative to 2024 earnings growth. So going back to your point, what are the kind of pluses and minuses as we think about that. One is, we're obviously coming off a down year. If you think about next year, I made a comment earlier in one of the questions around net price realization and that being slightly negative. That, to some degree, is what's putting pressure on our point of view at this point in time, which could shift as the market develops is putting pressure on what we see is that 60%, 70% of the $150 million coming into play next year, right? And again, what plus that up or plus that down from that point of view really comes in how you perform on volumes and how those end market gets to look and [until they] shift or change from our point of view today as we progress out the next 6 months of the year. Now I'll turn it to Ted.Edward L. DohenyYes. Arun, just building off of that is going through this depth and as we've put the CTO2Grow in there. And again, on the theme to under-promise, over-deliver the cost side, again, this is what we have in the plan. Our plan is to beat that. On the growth side, we got to get back to growth. As I shared is exactly what you've looked at in the model, but this is implying low end on the growth going into '24, '25 and '26. We have to turn that engine around to get those growth initiatives and to add 1% or 2% on top of what you see here to get it back to the model. Right now, those numbers are below the model for the outlook years. What we have to do internally is to beat that. We also, with the market going behind us, we think we -- that will lift. As we've shown with Reinvent what we did the first time, we leverage very nicely, but we've got to leverage off growth. So our crisis going forward, we have a growth crisis, and that's what we have the whole team going after it. And we will leverage quite nicely getting that growth, and that's what we're focused on to beat what you see here.OperatorOur next question is from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.Adam L. SamuelsonYes. Maybe continuing on the discussion in Protective and I appreciate that you're doing some portfolio review. Is there an element here of you have to shrink to grow in terms of some parts of the business that are -- that might be more commoditized that you have to functionally exit those business lines and trying to replace those with newer higher-margin business? And is there a time lag when that transition happens that might be impacting your shipments and kind of your confidence in and the growth cadence going into next year?Edward L. DohenyYes, Adam, it's an interesting -- I have to actually pause and think what you said shrink to grow. What we're -- part of the review on the portfolio, what we're looking at is does it fit into where we want to go? If you noticed, we changed the name, what was called Product Care, we went to Protective. Now we're calling it Automated Protective Solutions. So the lens we're putting on this business, does it fit our strategy of automation, digital and sustainable solutions for our customers. So what's being pruned or shrunk curve doesn't fit-in if it has a discrete products like where we shed the [Reflectix] business. We just talked about Kevothermal. These are discrete products, great products, but don't fit into that automation lens that we have for this business. So those businesses, if we can't grow them, we're looking to do something else with them. The other side of the Protective, as we strengthen this portfolio continue to get the cost right. So that's that cost to grow, we can grow more effectively and efficiently. And how we go to market through our digital transformation, reaching more customers more effectively and efficiently, where in the past, we said we couldn't afford to go to this customer, that customer. We want to get more nimble and go reach with these tremendous product lines we haven't (inaudible) Automated Protective Solutions portfolio, get to the reach of those customers and some of the new products that we have coming in. So we think we can grow this business, but we got some work to do.OperatorOur next question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho Securities.John Timothy HeilenbachThis is John on for Chris. Can you dig deeper on your current automation strategy? It appears that your clients have been pretty receptive recently. And so if you could provide more detail on your current backlog and how that's been trending versus your initial expectations? And then also, if you could just touch on digital and MySEE and how you see that growing in the intermediate term?Edward L. DohenyGood. So the first part of the question on the automation on where we are, feel good about that. We talked about our bookings. If we look into last year, we had some of our product lines in automation. On Protective and in Food at actually too high a level because we couldn't ship. So that pipeline, we worked -- the bookings, we've worked down. That was part of the growth in the first half of the year, seeing that up significantly. The second half of the year, we're working that bookings to down, but the issue that we're focused on is the pipeline, turning the pipeline into bookings. So as I shared earlier on the call, we're balancing that with a market, the demand reduction where customers are challenged on their CapEx spending, we have to actually work harder. We have to show significant in savings where we can help them in their productivity. So that's the challenge for us right now into the second half and going into next year. And also bringing in new automated solutions, new products. So that part, we feel good about. The second part of the question, if you can help me, Dustin?Dustin J. SemachGoing back through MySEE and...Edward L. DohenyOur digital solution, yes, as we're working on MySEE and how we make it easier for -- to do business with our customers, you see that moving fairly quickly. Again, Protective is where we have the most conversions. And our largest distributors are coming online with us and very cooperatively, seeing that we can help in the interactions working back and forth. We're talking about not just touchless in our factories, how can we touchless with our operations, communicate anything with customer service, order entry, et cetera. So we see that moving quickly. We need to get over half the company to really feel that tipping point, but with the second part of MySEE that we're excited about is slowly starting to happen, can we use our online design studios and help our customers actually design their products online quicker and faster so we can start bringing in the scalability? That part is still underway with more good things to come. Okay. Operator, I think that was time for -- or we have time for 1 more call and to wrap it up.OperatorI am showing no further questions at this time. So I would like to turn the conference back to Ted Doheny for closing remarks.Edward L. DohenyRight. I would like to thank everyone for their time today. We are definitely excited about the opportunities ahead for SEE, and we look forward to speaking again in November. Thank you very much.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 2.77, the question arises: Is Sealed Air modestly undervalued? This comprehensive valuation analysis aims to answer that question and provide an insightful understanding of the company's financial health and prospects.A Snapshot of Sealed Air Corp (NYSE:SEE)SEE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SEESealed Air Corp is a prominent player in the packaging industry, primarily focusing on food and product care. Its food packaging products, such as Cryovac, Darfresh, and OptiDure, are primarily aimed at meats. The product care segment includes Sealed Air's Bubble Wrap, Instapak, Jiffy mailers, and shrink film packaging systems that cater to industrial and e-commerce applications. The company currently trades at $40.6 per share, with a market cap of $5.9 billion. However, the GF Value estimates its fair value at $57.53, suggesting that Sealed Air might be undervalued.Sealed Air Corp (SEE): An Undervalued Gem in the Packaging Industry?Understanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure that estimates the intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on three factors: historical multiples at which the stock has traded, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it may indicate overvaluation or undervaluation, impacting its future returns.Based on the GF Value calculation, Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) seems to be modestly undervalued. With a current price of $40.6 per share and a market cap of $5.9 billion, it's believed that the stock's long-term return is likely to be higher than its business growth due to its relative undervaluation.Sealed Air Corp (SEE): An Undervalued Gem in the Packaging Industry?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Sealed Air's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's essential to review a company's financial strength before buying its stock. Sealed Air's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.06 is worse than 84.95% of companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry, indicating poor financial strength. The company's overall financial strength is ranked 4 out of 10 by GuruFocus.Story continuesSealed Air Corp (SEE): An Undervalued Gem in the Packaging Industry?Profitability and Growth of Sealed AirInvesting in profitable companies typically carries less risk. Sealed Air has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years, demonstrating consistent profitability. Over the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $5.6 billion and an EPS of $2.77. Its operating margin of 15.36% is better than 91.53% of companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry, indicating strong profitability.One of the most critical factors in company valuation is growth. The average annual revenue growth of Sealed Air is 7.4%, which ranks better than 54.26% of companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 17.4%, which ranks better than 74.1% of companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCA comparison of a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. Sealed Air's ROIC is 11.08, and its WACC is 8.08. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders.Sealed Air Corp (SEE): An Undervalued Gem in the Packaging Industry?ConclusionIn summary, Sealed Air stock appears to be modestly undervalued. Despite the company's poor financial condition, its profitability is strong, and its growth ranks better than 74.1% of companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry.

This compares to loss of $0.04 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this multichannel streaming platform would post a loss of $0.16 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.17, delivering a surprise of -6.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Loop Media , which belongs to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, posted revenues of $5.74 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.04%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $10.8 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Loop Media shares have lost about 71% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.7%.What's Next for Loop Media?While Loop Media has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Loop Media: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.13 on $6.04 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.54 on $31.72 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

54,58d833fd-3a08-3bd6-8523-c63000907ffd,ALGN,2023-08-09,"Align Technology, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ALGN) Stock Is Rallying But Financials Look Ambiguous: Will The Momentum Continue?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/align-technology-inc-nasdaq-algn-104406592.html,1691577846,STORY,['ALGN'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Align Technology's (NASDAQ:ALGN) stock increased significantly by 21% over the past three months. But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. Specifically, we decided to study Align Technology's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Align Technology How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Align Technology is:8.6% = US$314m ÷ US$3.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.09 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Align Technology's Earnings Growth And 8.6% ROEWhen you first look at it, Align Technology's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 8.9%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Still, Align Technology has seen a flat net income growth over the past five years. Bear in mind, the company's ROE is not very high. So that could also be one of the reasons behind the company's flat growth in earnings.Story continuesWe then compared Align Technology's net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 9.5% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Align Technology fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Align Technology Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Align Technology doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Align Technology's performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Smith AOS and Motorola Solutions MSI.4 GARP Stocks to Scoop Up for Maximum ReturnsGrowth at a reasonable price, or GARP, is an excellent strategy to earn quick investment profits. The GARP approach helps identify stocks priced below the market or any suitable target determined by a fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects regarding cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and others.A portfolio based on the GARP strategy comprises stocks that offer the best value and growth investing. Hubbell, Caterpillar, A.O. Smith and Motorola Solutions are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy offers ideal investment options by utilizing the best value and growth investing features. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects based on cash flow, revenues, EPS, etc.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the primary concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. The GARP strategy considers growth rates between 5% and 20% ideal.Another metric considered by growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though the investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also taken into consideration.Story continuesUsing the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Here are four of the seven stocks that made it through the screen:Hubbell designs and manufactures electrical and electronic products such as plugs, receptacles, connectors, data signal processing components, lighting fixtures, and high-voltage test and measurement equipment.

58,a0526e50-c557-37c1-92cb-2714f14d9035,MSI,2023-08-09,New Report Reveals Critical Perspective of Parents and Teachers on K-12 School Safety,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-reveals-critical-perspective-parents-130000318.html,1691499600,STORY,['MSI'],"[Research from Motorola Solutions highlights greatest safety concerns and insights on emergency notifications, technology and trainingCHICAGO, August 08, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Motorola Solutions (NYSE: MSI) released the findings of its 2023 K-12 School Safety Report which captured sentiments from 1,000 K-12 parents and 1,000 K-12 educators across the United States. The timely research reveals the most pressing concerns for those closest to school safety and highlights their perceptions about emergency preparedness plans, communication practices, school safety technologies and training for teachers and students. The new data shows that 67% of both parents and teachers are much more concerned about school safety now than they were five years ago, even as 73% of parents and 80% of teachers are confident that their school’s emergency response plans are effective.""School safety is top of mind for parents and educators alike, with both groups expressing concerns about mental health issues, bullying and active shooter situations,"" said Todd Piett, vice president of Rave Mobile Safety at Motorola Solutions. ""Ensuring that school personnel and families are aware of proactive planning practices, the notification methods employed by schools, technologies in place to thwart and report emergencies and school protocols for when incidents occur will not only help to alleviate worries, but ultimately improve safety outcomes.""Key findings from the report include:Safety and preparedness plans are key to gaining parents’ and teachers’ trust: When looking at schools, parents and teachers both rank school safety as a critical factor (66% for parents, 72% for teachers).Student mental health continues to be a top concern: Sixty-four percent of parents and 68% of teachers are very or extremely concerned about students’ mental health. Additionally, parents and teachers are worried about the mental health of community members who may perpetrate acts of violence on a school campus and teachers’ mental health.Story continuesCommunication channels before and during crisis events are essential: Nearly half of teachers (48%) say that they are able to submit anonymous or confidential tips to their school, public safety or both, compared to 43% of parents. In the event of an emergency, 57% of teachers indicate they would typically use a classroom phone to call the main office - a time-consuming approach that does not simultaneously loop in school district officials, 9-1-1 call handlers or first responders who may need to act fast.School safety technology is in use — and can help to put parents at ease: Seventy-one percent of teachers say that their school has adopted new safety technology in the last two years, but 54% of parents say they haven’t seen new technologies implemented. This disparity presents an opportunity for schools to periodically communicate with parents about the safety solutions they're implementing to reduce risk or expedite response. Almost half (46%) of parents say panic button apps that allow teachers and school staff to quickly notify 9-1-1 would increase their confidence in school safety.Nearly all teachers and parents report participation in lockdown drills: Eighty-nine percent of parents say their child has participated in a school lockdown drill, with 96% of teachers reporting the same. Eighty-two percent of parents say their child has participated in a drill specifically for active shooter preparedness, while 73% of teachers have participated in such drills with students and another 10% without students. Thirty-six percent of teachers have not engaged in training with first responders but they want to.Motorola Solutions offers a full ecosystem of technologies for school safety including panic button and mobile safety apps, access control, video security, body-worn cameras, critical communications, weapons detection and command center technologies - all of which can help to address the challenges and opportunities outlined in this report.

Respondents were 1,000 members of the public with children in grades K-12 and 1,000 teachers at K-12 grade levels.

This article will cover recent trends in female education and navigate through the major scholarships available. If you want to skip our analysis, go directly to the 5 Best Scholarships in the World for International Female Students.Female Participation in Education and the WorkforceWomen have been through the darkest of times trying to de-stigmatize women's presence in education and the workforce. Years of movements, campaigns, and protests have contributed to the notion that education for women is as important as it is for men. According to UNESCO, as of today 129 million girls are still out of school. Amongst them, 32 million girls belong to the primary school going age while 97 million belong to the secondary school age.The report suggests that while enrollment rates for both men and women in primary and secondary school tend to be equal, the completion rate of women is significantly lower than that of men. In lower-income developing countries, only 63% of girls complete primary school and only 36% complete secondary school. Higher secondary and high school experience similar trends, where the completion rate of girls from developing countries is barely 21%.The impact of such tends to have a multiplier effect on the labor force participation rate of women. According to a report by The World Bank, as of 2022, the global labor force participation rate for women was reported at 47%. Regions performing poorly in terms of female participation rate include South Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East.UNESCO suggested that the prominent reasons for this disparity are the inherent gender bias, poverty, and violence against women. However, there are a range of universities across the globe that do not charge a tuition fee. Some of the universities that do not charge a tuition fee include the Technical University of Munich, the Free University of Berlin, and the University of Hamburg, among others.Story continuesNotable Companies Leading the Women's Empowerment RaceWomen feel more than empowered by large companies offering funded scholarships and fellowships to women. The emergence of technology has not only allowed women to upskill themselves from home but also to avail massive leadership opportunities across the globe. In today's globalized world, companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) have significantly contributed to empowering women with their development programs and scholarships.Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the leading companies in the world with an immense focus on empowering women and diversifying their workforce. The company offers generous scholarships to women from developing countries to pursue higher education in STEM. These include Generation Scholarships for Women in STEM. On August 1, Forbes reported that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) recently launched a fund to back startups in Asia-Pacific. The fund is called Google for Startups Women Founders Fund. This fund will provide $100,000 in cash to six women founded and led startups in the tech industry.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a prominent digital powerhouse, offers generous scholarships to women across the globe. One of the most popular scholarships is the Microsoft Women Scholarship. The scholarship is offered to students in their senior year of high school and students enrolled in an undergraduate degree in STEM. On March 29, Bloomberg reported that Kamala Harris, the Vice President of the United States, joined hands with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to close the gender gap in the digital economy. The program aims to contribute a total of over $1 billion to enhance women's well-being and improve their position in the digital industry in Africa. The program will offer skill-enhancing training sessions to equip African women with the latest technology.Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was ranked as one of the best companies for women to work for by Forbes. The company offers generous scholarships to graduate and undergraduate female students majoring in computer science. The number of awards offered and provided is not defined. In fact, whoever meets the criteria is awarded a grant of $10,000.Moreover, on January 10, Forbes published an article that said that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) celebrated the 10-year anniversary of its Leadership Circles Program this year. The Leadership Circles Program was established to empower women and train them to exercise their duties in leadership positions. As of today, over 30 women have graduated from the Leadership Circles Program and have been placed as directors and managers within the company.Women Taking Leaps in EntrepreneurshipAccording to a report by The World Economic Forum, as of 2022, women consisted of 47% of entrepreneurs in the United States. The industries with the largest number of women entrepreneurs were Non-governmental and Membership Organizations and the Education industry, with 47% and 46% of women entrepreneurs respectively.Some of the notable startups and projects by women entrepreneurs have been praised across the globe. These include Helping Hand, Naturemetrics, Umgraumeio, Flash Forest, TrashCon, and Aquacycl.In January 2023, the World Economic Forum reported these six startups as the tech companies leading the future in 2022. Helping Hand is a joint venture between a Norwegian digital learning software company, Attensi, and clinical psychologist Dr Solfrid Raknes. Helping Hand is a gamified simulation to help people in war zones deal with anxiety and depression. As of now, Helping Hand has helped 2000 Syrian teenagers in camps in Lebanon.Naturemetrics, founded by Kat Bruce, is a biodiversity data provider based in the United Kingdom. The company employs DNA sequencing to identify diverse species and gather data. This data is then provided to companies in the energy, infrastructure, and agriculture sector to ensure they comply with environmental standards. Umgraumeio, another tech startup, uses AI to prevent and fight wildfires. The technology allows the team to identify risk zones and send alerts to the concerned authorities. Flash Forest is another great initiative based in Canada. The company uses drone technology to reforest areas impacted by wildfires, using developed seeds rich in nutrients to assist with speedy germination.TrashCon is a waste management company, currently setting up a recycling plant in Bangalore. The new recycling plant will be equipped with the machinery to process 500 tonnes of metals, plastics, glass, and fiber every day.  Aquacycl, a wastewater management company, is based in the United States. Aquacycl’s BioElectrochemical Treatment Technology (BETT) treats and cleans wastewater using natural bacteria. Furthermore, the company uses the treated water to generate electricity.Compared to the past decade, women have begun to take charge to create wealth for themselves. Such changes can be attributed to women-friendly policies in education and the workforce. Some of the most prominent self-made female billionaires today include Zhang Ning, Lu Yiwen, Melanie Perkins, and Tatyana Bakalchuk.Acquiring adequate education and exposure is crucial to be able to execute your ideas. Therefore it is important that females avail equal education and employment opportunities. While millions of women shy away from higher education due to financial circumstances, we have compiled a list of some prestigious scholarships for international female students across the globe.18 Best Scholarships in the World for International Female StudentsCopyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We acquired information about the scholarships available to international female students from top universities.com, leverageedu.com, and scholars4dev. Using this information, we shortlisted the top 18 scholarships based on the scholarship amount offered to the candidate. The exact funding amount was acquired from the official sites of the scholarships; our basis of ranking. The total coverage of the scholarships consists of the tuition fee waiver and ancillary benefits such as travel and airfare.The number of awards available and the course level for each scholarship were prominent factors contributing to our rankings. However, the availability of these metrics was inconsistent through the scholarships we narrowed down. Therefore, we have mentioned the metrics that were available of the two for each scholarship. We have ranked these scholarships in ascending order of the coverage they provide and used the number of awards or course level (whichever was available) as the tie-breaker.18 Best Scholarships in the World for International Female Students.18.

As for the AI hype, Palantir CEO Alex Karp emphasized that the data company aims to do much more than merely produce a computer-generated poetry tool like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)-backed ChatGPT that risks being disapproved by some, with the company still figuring out how to monetize the technology it is well acquainted with.Second Quarter ResultsFor the quarter that ended on June 30th, sales amounted to $533 million with government revenue making up 57% of revenue. International government revenue was leading the way as it expanded 31% to $76 million.Up from $179 million net loss made during last year’s comparable quarter, Palantir made a net income rose of $28 million, or 1 cent per share.GuidanceThird-quarter revenue is expected between $553 million and $557 million, topping Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $552 million.Palantir lifted its full year outlook. Adjusted income from operations has been guided at $576 million, up from May’s outlook range between 506 million and $556 million as the data analytics company announced a contract from the U.S. Special Operations Command that is valued at $463 million.An AI Fortress In The MakingPalantir's competitive advantage is its experience in offering AI-based solutions to enterprise clients. While other companies such as Microsoft and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) racing to lead the way with AI-based solutions, AI has been supporting its services during the past two decades. But Palantir has not been living off its past glory as it launched a new AI platform in April. With AIP, users are able to deploy large language models in its internal network and personalize recommendations, actions and workflows by using proprietary data. With its customized services that resemble those of ChatGPT that OpenAI and Microsoft offer, AIP has the potential to be a game changer over the long-run as it is already enjoying unprecedented demand from military clients. The Wedbush analyst Dan Ives went as far as naming Palantir as the ""Messi"" of AI.Story continuesWith its latest results, Palantir showed its focus on profitability and given its extensive AI experience, partners span across the public and private domain, it is well positioned for the next decade, being a major player in the generative AI era next to Big Tech such as Microsoft and Alphabet.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

This is because the underlying companies provide essential products and services that are required no matter what the broader economy is doing. While they may not offer the most exciting returns, they are usually considered to be solid long-term performers. That said, there are a few healthcare stocks to dump that we will look at today.From an investment perspective, some potential red flags that could signal its time to sell healthcare stocks are class-action lawsuits and falling sales. Ongoing litigation can create an overhang on a company’s shares for months or even years, while competition from generics or new drugs can seriously dent a firm’s revenue.Below are three healthcare stocks to sell now that are facing precisely these issues.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is racking up Opioid settlements with state and local governments totaling billions of dollars.While the company admits no guilt, last month it agreed to pay $500 million to New Mexico and finalized a settlement with the state of California for $5.7 billion. This followed an agreement in May to pay $230 million to the city of San Francisco and $683 million to Florida a year before that. And in late 2022, Walgreens reached an agreement with a coalition of 17 state attorneys general to pay out $5.7 billion over 15 years.The hits are likely to keep coming and could saddle Walgreens with a huge amount of debt, forcing the company to sell more shares, unload profitable assets or take other actions that could be dilutive to shareholders.Meanwhile, in line with my previous predictions, Walgreens reported disappointing fiscal third-quarter results on June 28. While revenue rose 8.6% year over year, earnings missed estimates. And management sharply lowered their full-year earnings guidance, citing weakening consumer spending and lower demand for Covid-19 vaccines and testing. I also see competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) playing a role.Story continuesThe weak outlook led Deutsche Bank to cut its rating on WBA stock to “hold” and lower its price target to $34 from $46.Johnson &amp; Jonson (JNJ)jnj healthcare stocksSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of paying out billions of dollars in settlements, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in April proposed paying at least $8.9 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits alleging the company’s talc-containing powders caused cancer.However, that plan may be in jeopardy. For the second time, a court has rejected the company’s efforts to have its LTL Management subsidiary, which was created to handle the talc litigation, file for bankruptcy protection.Although the company has said it will appeal the latest ruling, a Bank of America analyst warned that Johnson &amp; Johnson will likely have to fight individual lawsuits, which could prove much more costly. And, according to a Morgan Stanley analyst, “the talc litigation remains an overhang on the stock,”JNJ’s forward price-earnings ratio of 15.8 is far too high given the huge litigation overhang.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comIn a previous column, I noted that AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) was struggling with the loss of exclusivity on its best-selling biologic treatment, Humira, with U.S. sales declining 26% year over year in the first quarter.While the company’s recently released second-quarter results came in better than expected, Humira revenue continued to decline, falling by 26% in the U.S. and 25% globally. Overall revenue declined as well, falling nearly 5% to $13.9 billion despite beating estimates. Moreover, AbbVie posted weaker-than-expected sales of its newer psoriasis drug Skyrizi and autoimmune disorder treatment Rinvoq.It’s also worth noting that while Botox sales for both cosmetic and therapeutic use beat estimates, there’s a new product that could be coming for Botox’s lunch. Revance Therapeutics’ (NASDAQ:RVNC) DAXXIFY was recently approved for the treatment of wrinkles and has been shown to work faster and last longer than Botox.With competition heating up on multiple fronts, put ABBV on your list of healthcare stocks to dump.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

The recovering demand from China has gone a long way in providing some support to the quarterly results. The company has a VGM Score of B (as of Aug 4).The world’s largest coffee house chain belongs to the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector and currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Zacks Retail sector lies in the top 25% of the Zacks Industry Rank.Earnings in FocusStarbucks has reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents by 5.3%. The bottom line increased 19% year over year from an adjusted EPS of 84 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Quarterly revenues of $9,168.3 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,290 million by 1.3%. However, the top line increased by 12.5% on a year-over-year basis.

The company last year said it had rehired the seven employees to comply with a judge's order, but still pursued the appeal.The Memphis store is one of nearly 300 Starbucks cafes in the United States to unionize since late 2021. The company was union-free for decades.More than 600 complaints have been filed with the labor board accusing Starbucks of illegal labor practices such as firing union supporters, spying on workers and closing stores during labor campaigns.The 6th Circuit is considering Starbucks' appeal of a February ruling in a separate case barring the company from firing or disciplining employees at an Ann Arbor, Michigan cafe.Other U.S. appeals courts are considering rulings from the labor board that Starbucks illegally fired union organizers in Philadelphia and has refused to bargain with unionized workers in its home city of Seattle.The company has broadly denied wrongdoing and said it offers employees competitive wages and benefits and respects their rights under federal labor law.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)]"

(NYSE: BROS) reported a surge in second-quarter Ebitda, leading it to raise full-year guidance as it announced company President Christine Barone would become CEO at the start of 2024.The fast-growing beverage chain, which went public just under two years ago, reported Ebitda of $48.6 million as compared to $23.9 million in the same period of 2022. The improvement was driven in part by strong traffic that led to 580 basis points of sequential same shop sales growth quarter-over-quarter.In turn, the company now expects full-year Ebitda of $135 million and $140 million, up from at least $125 million.Store growth also continues to be a key top-line driver, with at least 150 expected in 2023. The company has said it has a target of 4,000 shops over 10-15 years.“We plan to stay on that trajectory,” Ms. Barone told IPO Edge in an interview. “We have had eight straight quarters of 30-plus shop growth.”In conjunction with the earnings announcement, Dutch Bros said Ms. Barone would become CEO on January 1, 2024 having been named President in February. Joth Ricci, who has been CEO for about five years, will remain onboard until January to assist the transition.“This was a small regional business looking for a path to growth,” Mr. Ricci told IPO Edge. “We have achieved many of the goals we set out in August 2018.”He added that he has known Ms. Barone for a decade and is happy to pass the torch.  “It was a natural fit for her to come in,” he said. “We are looking forward to making it a great transition.”Story continuesTravis Boersma, Co-founder and Executive Chairman who started the company with his brother Dane in 1992, said, “Joth has been a true partner and will forever be part of the Dutch Bros family… I’m confident in the foundation he’s created and I’m grateful for the years he’s dedicated to Dutch Bros and our crews.”Turning to strategy, Dutch Bros will continue to focus on reaching a young, growing demographic of consumers whose tastes differ from older generations. Cold drinks, strongly preferred by younger customers, drove over 90% of sales last quarter, consistent with similarly high levels in recent periods.Mr. Ricci pointed out that Dutch Bros continues to focus on innovations, such as the Firecracker Rebel energy drink with Soft Top &amp; Poppin’ Candy. The special drink, designed to be a fun addition to Fourth of July activities, is a twist on the popular Rebel energy drink topped with fizzing candies similar to Pop Rocks.Dutch Bros was started in Oregon but has made a steady march further afield, especially in the last few years. Asked about the company’s expansion plans, Ms. Barone said the company pays close attention to what makes customers happiest as it rolls out new locations in states like Texas. “It allows us to continue our move toward the east coast,” she said.There’s also scope to focus more technology as Dutch Bros grows in years to come, including a focus on an app for Dutch Rewards and the potential to harness more big data.  “We’re at the beginning of our journey,” Ms. Barone said.Contact:IPO-Edge.comEditor@IPO-Edge.comTwitter: @IPOEdgeInstagram: @IPOEdge]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 10 Most Important Entrepreneurs of All Time. Entrepreneurship Trends in 2023AI has become a disruptive force in the world of entrepreneurship, one of the most profitable professions in the world, which is yielding remarkable outcomes as there is statistical evidence of its impact. The rapid adoption of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, which garnered over 1 billion visits within three months of release, speaks volumes about its versatility in tasks such as copywriting and cash flow forecasting. Startups are embracing AI to stay ahead of market demand, with over 40% of failures attributed to misreading the market.The cost-saving potential of AI is also evident, as it enables startups to automate tasks which reduces the heavy burden of payroll expenses. As AI continues to grow, it empowers entrepreneurs with better marketing budget allocation, improved decision-making, and enhanced data-driven strategies, creating a dynamic workforce that anticipates future AI trends. By prioritizing AI proficiency and harnessing its capabilities, entrepreneurs can position themselves for success in the AI-driven future of business.On the other hand, startups and small businesses are gaining momentum, fueled by a global passion for problem-solving and a burgeoning spirit of entrepreneurship. Governments around the world are recognizing the crucial role entrepreneurs play in driving economic growth and are increasingly fostering environments conducive to innovation, with policies aimed at supporting startups and facilitating access to capital.For example, over its 70-year history, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has played a vital role in supporting small American businesses, which constitute 99.9% of all businesses and employ 46.4% of private sector employees. Under President Biden, there has been record job growth and a historic small business boom as entrepreneurs have applied to start 12.2 million new small businesses.Story continuesMoreover, the SBA has expanded its programs to meet the changing needs of small businesses while addressing issues of capital access gaps for rural, veteran, women, and minority-owned businesses. During the pandemic, the SBA became even more critical, to prevent the devastating impact seen during the 2008 financial crisis on minority and women-owned businesses. As a result of government, corporate, and philanthropic support, Black/African American- and Hispanic/Latino-owned businesses have shown remarkable growth, with average revenues increasing by 32.7% and 17.1%, respectively, compared to 2019.Entrepreneurs with a LegacyIn the vast tapestry of human history, few figures have left an indelible mark on the world like entrepreneurs have. Those pioneers of innovation and risk-takers have reshaped industries, revolutionized economies, and catapulted society into new eras of progress.However, to truly understand the essence of entrepreneurship, we must journey back to its historical roots. Ancient merchants and traders paved the way for the entrepreneurs of today, and challenged national borders to exchange goodsand thus set the foundation for global commerce.One such iconic figure was Andrew Carnegie, a 19th-century industrialist who revolutionized the steel industry and truly set the stage for the America’s industrial might. If his net worth from then is adjusted according to the inflation today, it would be around $372 billion which would make him the richest entrepreneur of all time, even richer than Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, who are two of the most famous entrepreneurs in the world.Another legend, Thomas Edison, was a game changing prolific inventor and entrepreneur whose inventions, like the phonograph and the electric light bulb, transformed modern living. Edison's pursuit of innovation and his belief in the power of research and development laid the groundwork for future generations of inventors. He is considered one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. Speaking of legendary entrepreneurship, one of the most prime examples of influential entrepreneurship that has shaped the world on a global scale is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) revolutionized personal computing and later transformed industries formusic, smartphones, and tablets. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s innovative products, like the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, redefined user experiences and set new standards for design and functionality.While it is true that legendary entrepreneurs are rare, when it comes to wealth-building, the newer generations have challenged the notion of toiling away for years to become wealthy.

The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Archer-Daniels-Midland’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland What Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Worth?Great news for investors – Archer-Daniels-Midland is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Archer-Daniels-Midland’s ratio of 11.17x is below its peer average of 17.72x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Food industry. Archer-Daniels-Midland’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will Archer-Daniels-Midland generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Archer-Daniels-Midland, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although ADM is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to ADM, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADM for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. While conducting our analysis, we found that Archer-Daniels-Midland has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.If you are no longer interested in Archer-Daniels-Midland, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Carter has said she is a Christian who opposes abortion.Starr, a Trump appointee, gave the lawyers until Aug. 28 to attend an eight-hour training conducted by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), which is routinely involved in high-profile court cases on abortion and religious liberties.ADF has spearheaded efforts to restrict the availability of abortion pill mifepristone and helped draft a Mississippi abortion ban upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in its June 2022 ruling eliminating women's constitutional right to abortion.Southwest in its statement did not elaborate on the basis for its appeal.Carter is represented by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, a conservative worker advocacy group. Mark Mix, the group's president, said Monday's ruling ""shuts down Southwest Airlines’ bald-faced attempt to dodge its responsibility to inform flight attendants of its wrongdoing.""Story continuesJudges often require employers to take steps to remedy discriminatory conduct, such as training workers and adopting new policies, but it is unusual for them to order company officials to undergo training conducted by specific groups. Starr cited older rulings requiring lawyers to attend continuing education or ethics training.The ruling may be unprecedented, and the choice of ADF to conduct the training is troubling given its history of advocating a conservative Christian viewpoint, according to David Lopez, who was general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) during the Obama administration.That could interfere with the lawyers’ constitutional rights, he said, especially if they practice other religions.“The court is moving into some really dangerous territory here,” said Lopez, who is now a law professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey.But Andrea Lucas, a current EEOC commissioner appointed by Trump, said the case highlighted that many companies view workers' religious liberty as an afterthought.""Companies and their lawyers should take findings of religious discrimination as seriously as discrimination based on race (or) sex,"" Lucas said.ADF's chief legal counsel, Jim Campbell, said the group was ""happy to help"" by providing training on laws barring religious discrimination.“Every company should respect religious liberty and diverse viewpoints in the workplace,"" Campbell said in a statement.Southwest has maintained that Carter was fired for harassing coworkers about the Women's March on social media in violation of a company ""civility policy.""A jury last year found that Southwest and Carter's union had engaged in religious discrimination. Starr ordered them to pay Carter more than $800,000 and reinstate her to her job.Southwest and the union are appealing that decision, which also required the airline to notify employees of their right to express their religious views on social media.Starr on Monday said Southwest flouted that order by instead telling employees that ""the court ordered us to inform you that Southwest does not discriminate against our employees for their religious practices and beliefs.""Southwest in a memo drafted by the three lawyers - Kerrie Forbes, Kevin Minchey, and Chris Maberry - also defended Carter's firing and said it would continue enforcing its social media policy.

Mark Mix, the group's president, said Monday's ruling ""shuts down Southwest Airlines’ bald-faced attempt to dodge its responsibility to inform flight attendants of its wrongdoing.""Judges often require employers to take steps to remedy discriminatory conduct, such as training workers and adopting new policies, but it is unusual for them to order company officials to undergo training conducted by specific groups. Starr cited older rulings requiring lawyers to attend continuing education or ethics training.Story continuesThe ruling may be unprecedented, and the choice of ADF to conduct the training is troubling given its history of advocating a conservative Christian viewpoint, according to David Lopez, who was general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) during the Obama administration.That could interfere with the lawyers’ constitutional rights, he said, especially if they practice other religions.“The court is moving into some really dangerous territory here,” said Lopez, who is now a law professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey.But Andrea Lucas, a current EEOC commissioner appointed by Trump, said the case highlighted that many companies view workers' religious liberty as an afterthought.""Companies and their lawyers should take findings of religious discrimination as seriously as discrimination based on race (or) sex,"" Lucas said.ADF's chief legal counsel, Jim Campbell, said the group was ""happy to help"" by providing training on laws barring religious discrimination.“Every company should respect religious liberty and diverse viewpoints in the workplace,"" Campbell said in a statement.Southwest has maintained that Carter was fired for harassing coworkers about the Women's March on social media in violation of a company ""civility policy.""A jury last year found that Southwest and Carter's union had engaged in religious discrimination.

In a blistering 29-page order, the judge said the airline acted as if its own policy limiting what employees can say is more important than a federal law protecting religious speech.On Monday, the judge ordered Southwest to pay the flight attendant's most recent legal costs, dictated a statement for Southwest to relay to employees, and ordered three Southwest lawyers to complete “religious-liberty training"" from a conservative Christian legal-advocacy group.Southwest filed an appeal of last year's judgement in May. A spokesman said Tuesday that the Dallas-based airline also plans to appeal the judge's new sanctions.For Southwest, the sanctions add insult to injury. They stem from a roughly $800,000 judgment against the airline and the flight attendant's union. Although that was less than the jury's $5.1 million award, Charlene Carter also got her job back.Carter, a longtime union critic, said she was fired after she called the union president “despicable” for attending the 2017 Women’s March in Washington, D.C. At the event, women protested the inauguration of President Donald Trump and called for protecting abortion rights among many issues.The airline and Local 556 of the Transport Workers Union said Carter had made offensive posts on Facebook and harassed the union president in private messages.The jury in a Dallas court found that Southwest violated Carter’s right to religious speech.After the trial last year, the judge — a Trump nominee who joined the bench in 2019 — ordered the airline to tell flight attendants that under federal law, it “may not discriminate against Southwest flight attendants for their religious practices and beliefs.”Story continuesInstead, the airline told employees that it “does not discriminate,"" and it doubled down by telling flight attendants to follow the airline policy that it cited in firing Carter.In an order this week that alternated between sarcasm and outrage, Starr ruled that Southwest “didn't come close to complying with the Court's order.” He schooled the airline on the definitions of “may,” “does” and ”tolerate"" — complete with footnotes citing the Merriam-Webster dictionary.The judge ordered Southwest to email a new, verbatim statement declaring that the airline may not discriminate against flight attendants for religious beliefs “including — but not limited” to abortion.Starr ordered three company lawyers to undergo eight hours of religious-liberty training this month by the Alliance Defending Freedom, calling the group “particularly well-suited” for the work. The Southern Poverty Law Center has called ADF an anti-LGBTQ hate group. ADF disputes the characterization.Starr held senior positions in the Texas attorney general's office for several years before Trump nominated him for the federal bench. The Senate confirmed his nomination 51-39, voting along party lines in the then-GOP-controlled body. He is a member of the conservative legal group the Federalist Society.]"

Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Source: venusvi / Shutterstock.comMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on hospital buildings.The company has long been embroiled in controversy. Two of its largest tenants, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings, are in financial trouble. As those two companies make up more than a third of Medical Properties Trust’s overall revenues, that puts the REIT’s outlook on a shaky footing.Medical Properties Trust has turned into a battleground stock. Multiple short sellers and research firms have taken aim at the company. These analysts allege untoward insider dealings and questionable financial disclosures, among other matters. Income investors have held onto the stock for its high dividend.However, with Medical Properties’ mixed financial results along with the general pressure caused by higher interest rates, this seems like a far-too-risky pick for the average real estate investor. Currently, MPW stock has more than 20% short interest, indicating that the bears have high conviction that this REIT is in poor health. With the stock’s recent rebound, now is a great time to sell at this more favorable exit point.Simon Property Group (SPG)building facade of simon property group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comStory continuesSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is a REIT focused primarily on malls and outlet centers.Malls have been attempting to bounce back after the COVID-19 related disruption to the industry. However, it’s been a rough road. While the economy has reopened, e-commerce continues to inexorably take its toll on shopping malls.Simon has focused on higher-end malls, which has blunted the impact of the industry’s decay to a degree. Yet so many department stores and other traditional tenants go bust and shutter their operations entirely. That trend continues, with a recent Wall Street Journal article discussing how local malls are stuck in a “death spiral“.Simon is trying to make the most of a tough situation. But investors seem far too generous with the firm’s valuation. Especially in a world with higher interest rates and a potential recession on the horizon, shopping malls are unlikely to be an attractive asset class anytime soon.City Office REIT (CIO)hand of person in a suit dangling keys with a house symbol on the ring. Windows overlooking city skyline in background.Source: ImageFlow/shutterstock.comCity Office REIT (NYSE:CIO) is a smaller REIT focused on sunbelt American markets.The REIT is not especially well-diversified. Its top three markets make up 57% of its estimated total gross asset value. These three markets are Phoenix, Tampa, and Raleigh, North Carolina, respectively. These are somewhat smaller markets than the average office REIT which often focus on large cities like New York, Boston, or San Francisco.This leaves City Office in a relatively vulnerable position. It has a significant number of near-term expiring leases. Meanwhile, demand for office space can be more volatile in some of these regional markets. The industry as a whole is struggling to deal with the shift to remote work. City Office’s properties may not be well-positioned for that reality.The company recently cut its dividend in half, noting that the reduction would free up $16 million per year in additional liquidity. That might not be enough, however, given the large amount of capital that may be required to reposition aging office properties. In addition, City Office isn’t generating profits on an earnings basis anymore. It lost $1.2 million last quarter. This casts further doubt around the security of the remaining dividend payout.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

V, Mastercard Inc. MA, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. FIS, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2133601/5-financial-transaction-stocks-in-focus-amid-steady-consumer-spendingThe Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from expanding transaction volumes resulting from the widespread adoption of digital means. An advanced digital solutions suite, built on mergers and acquisitions as well as tech investments, equips players to capitalize on a booming digital era. Signs of subsiding inflation might pave the way for increased consumer spending in the days ahead.Recovery in travel is likely to drive cross-border volumes. Companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and Equifax Inc. are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe, facilitating the switching of transactions and permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryA Booming Digital Environment: The pandemic made people aware of the hassle-free and affordable nature of contactless payments. Even after the pandemic receded, the digitization trend showed no sign of slowing down across the globe. A higher Internet penetration rate and increased usage of smartphones contribute to the increased uptake of digital payments.In light of the prevailing scenario, it has become inevitable to build an enhanced contactless payments suite or upgrade the existing ones. For this, financial transaction services players have to often resort to technology investments that might escalate costs for them. However, owing to the long-term benefits that such investments provide, the industry players have come up with diversified contactless payment options such as mobile wallets, biometrics and QR codes.Such initiatives will enable the players to solidify their presence in the global digital payments market, boost their customer base and diversify income streams. To counter the growing number of cybercrimes that are often associated with online payments, industry participants remain equipped with fraud prevention solutions.Steady Rise in Consumer Spending: Improved consumer spending implies greater utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction services players. This, in turn, offers an opportunity for industry players to process higher transaction volumes. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market add to the purchasing power of consumers and subsiding inflationary headwinds boost hopes for continually rising consumer spending in the days ahead.Also, the ease with which e-commerce shopping can be done within the comfort of one’s home is likely to provide an impetus to growth in consumer spending. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in the January-June 2023 period, consumer spending in each of the months has witnessed an uptick sequentially.Improved Cross-Border Volumes: Increased travel, whether for business or recreation, will likely boost cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. With industrial and business activities back on track, the demand for international travel is likely to remain steady in the days ahead. Industry participants often come up with efficient business travel solutions that make flight bookings simpler. The ease of digital payments transcends the barrier between borders. Platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise aid in the seamless processing of digital payments.A Prudent M&amp;A Strategy: In addition to tech investments, a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy often becomes the means for building an efficient digital suite. The strategy also gives an opportunity to financial transaction services players to foray into new markets, expand their foothold in existing ones, broaden partner networks and increase customer base. However, interest rate hikes by the Fed to tame inflation result in higher borrowing costs.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

95,cb6be91f-5acc-32bc-a1ca-70302a2d9bac,GPN,2023-08-09,5 Financial Transaction Stocks in Focus Amid Steady Consumer Spending,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-financial-transaction-stocks-focus-140000783.html,1691503200,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'MA', 'GPN', 'V', 'EFX', 'FIS']","[The Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from expanding transaction volumes resulting from the widespread adoption of digital means. An advanced digital solutions suite, built on mergers and acquisitions as well as tech investments, equips players to capitalize on a booming digital era. Signs of subsiding inflation might pave the way for increased consumer spending in the days ahead. Recovery in travel is likely to drive cross-border volumes. Companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. FIS, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.About the Industry The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors. The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe, facilitating the switching of transactions and permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryA Booming Digital Environment: The pandemic made people aware of the hassle-free and affordable nature of contactless payments. Even after the pandemic receded, the digitization trend showed no sign of slowing down across the globe. A higher Internet penetration rate and increased usage of smartphones contribute to the increased uptake of digital payments. In light of the prevailing scenario, it has become inevitable to build an enhanced contactless payments suite or upgrade the existing ones. For this, financial transaction services players have to often resort to technology investments that might escalate costs for them. However, owing to the long-term benefits that such investments provide, the industry players have come up with diversified contactless payment options such as mobile wallets, biometrics and QR codes. Such initiatives will enable the players to solidify their presence in the global digital payments market, boost their customer base and diversify income streams. To counter the growing number of cybercrimes that are often associated with online payments, industry participants remain equipped with fraud prevention solutions.Story continuesSteady Rise in Consumer Spending: Improved consumer spending implies greater utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction services players. This, in turn, offers an opportunity for industry players to process higher transaction volumes. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market add to the purchasing power of consumers and subsiding inflationary headwinds boost hopes for continually rising consumer spending in the days ahead. Also, the ease with which e-commerce shopping can be done within the comfort of one’s home is likely to provide an impetus to growth in consumer spending. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in the January-June 2023 period, consumer spending in each of the months has witnessed an uptick sequentially.Improved Cross-Border Volumes: Increased travel, whether for business or recreation, will likely boost cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. With industrial and business activities back on track, the demand for international travel is likely to remain steady in the days ahead. Industry participants often come up with efficient business travel solutions that make flight bookings simpler. The ease of digital payments transcends the barrier between borders. Platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise aid in the seamless processing of digital payments.A Prudent M&amp;A Strategy: In addition to tech investments, a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy often becomes the means for building an efficient digital suite. The strategy also gives an opportunity to financial transaction services players to foray into new markets, expand their foothold in existing ones, broaden partner networks and increase customer base. However, interest rate hikes by the Fed to tame inflation result in higher borrowing costs.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

""It's proving how vital the category is and how important the IP is.""Moviegoers have agreed.Mattel's (MAT) ""Barbie"" live-action PG-13 flick headlined by Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken continues to clean up at the box office.About three weeks into its theatrical release, Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster has hauled in a mind-blowing $1 billion-plus at the global box office, Warner Bros. said.Mattel has positioned itself to win royally this coming holiday season from eye-popping interest in all things Barbie.The toymaker has licensed the Barbie name to merchandise that is sprouting up everywhere.For instance, there is a Barbie apparel deal with specialty retailer Gap (GPS). The product line ranges from pink Barbie hoodies to pink pet clothing.Since the release in late July, Mattel has introduced a host of new dolls inspired by the movie. One doll in particular that is garnering a lot of attention is Weird Barbie, played in the movie by Kate McKinnon.The steady stream of movie-inspired toys is expected to continue, experts say.""We have captured a cultural moment,"" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz told Yahoo Finance Live following the company's earnings last week.That said, both Mattel and Hasbro have taken cautious stances with respect to their holiday season outlooks as consumers continue to shop the toy category cautiously due to rounds of price hikes.Mattel only reaffirmed its full-year profit outlook last week despite its success with ""Barbie"".Barbie dolls stand on a table during the Comic Con convention in Caracas, Venezuela, Saturday, July 15, 2023.

Earnings were up 46.5% year over year. The upside can be attributed to favorable discrete tax benefits from the resolution of various tax matters and lower operating expenses incurred by the company during the quarter.Net sales increased 6.4% year over year to $1.19 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 billion. Excluding the negative currency impact, sales rose 6.6%. The upside was driven by strategic pricing actions undertaken by management during the quarter, sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma and the acquisition of the U.S. &amp; Canadian Good Start infant formula brand. Unfavorable currency movements partially offset these. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 0.8% year over year.Shares of Perrigo were up 1.3% in pre-market trading on Aug 8, likely due to the better-than-expected earnings results.

However, this upside was partially offset by purposeful SKU prioritization actions to enhance margins as part of the company's Supply Chain Reinvention Program undertaken last year.CSCI: The segment reported net sales of $442.4 million, up 12.4% from the year-ago period’s levels. At constant-currency (cc) rates, sales were up 12.8% year over year. Organically, sales increased 7.1%. Segment revenues benefited from the higher sales of HRA Pharma brands and strategic pricing actions.

""Good news is it's going in a positive direction, [and] the challenge still is getting streaming to replicate the profits of that dual revenue stream from linear cable,"" Sunday Gravy Entertainment President Peter Liguori told Yahoo Finance Live.Liguori, who is also a VideoAmp Board Member and Former Tribune Media CEO, believes subscriber is slowing in the overall streaming landscape. He looks at digital advertising potential for other streamers, like Netflix (NFLX), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Disney (DIS), whose CEO Bob Iger's plans for its linear television networks have become ""really a matter of value."" Liguori also comments how the Hollywood writers and actors' strikes continue to impact media companies and studios.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- It's a big week of earnings reports from media giants, Paramount posting Q2 results on Monday. The stock initially popping on stronger than expected results and progress in its streaming business. Now, the company also announced the sale of Simon &amp; Schuster for $1.6 billion. And these results putting some pressure on Disney to deliver. Investors are awaiting those results after the bell tomorrow.For more on the streamers and the future of TV, we want to turn to Peter Liguori. He's a Sunday Gravy Entertainment president and former Tribune Media CEO. Peter, it's great to see you. So let's talk about what we've learned from Paramount, and what it means for the broader media landscape. So Paramount Global beating expectations, strong growth in its streaming business. What does this tell us just about how the broader media landscape looks right now, and how Paramount's positioned within that very, very competitive industry?PETER LIGUORI: Well, I think the good news is they've narrowed their loss. They were able to gain 700,000 new subs. They cut their losses. But in fact, they still have losses. And it's reflective of what's going on overall in the industry, where the income coming in for-- the revenue for streamers is much different and much less than what it is in the typical linear cable model, where you have the dual revenue streams of affiliate fees and advertising.Story continuesSo good news is it's going in the positive direction. Challenge still is getting streaming to replicate the profits of that dual revenue stream from linear cable.DIANE KING HALL: And Peter, Diane here. I want to ask you just about streaming in general, whether we're talking about a Paramount or recently Warner Brothers Discovery, which saw loss of subscribers. And when you're talking about streaming, in general, whether they're growing at slow growth or some are losing subscribers, and you have Disney coming up in terms of its quarterly results. Has streaming hit a wall in terms of its growth?PETER LIGUORI: Well, certainly slowing. And I'd like to take a step back on Warner's. Yes, Warner's did lose some subscribers, but I would credit that to the friction of them combining their services. There's no indication that this has anything to do with the quality of their content or the quality of their offering. But there's no doubt that there is some plateauing.There's zero doubt that streaming services will-- I used to work at HBO, no matter what our program offering was, we wound up consistently having a 50% churn rate-- new subscribers, subscribers leaving. I think with the maturity of streaming, you're going to wind up noticing those levels of churn and a kind of leveling off of the growth. But there's still growth, there's still a trajectory there.- Peter, how much pressure does this place on Disney just in terms of we've heard from Bob Iger, he sounds like he's weighing almost all options at this point when it comes to the media strategy going forward, what he you should do with ABC, FX, the roadmap, what that looks like for ESPN going forward. How do you see that moving forward, and what those best options would look like?PETER LIGUORI: Well, the claim that got the most press was his discussion about his linear networks-- FX, ABC, the local stations. And look, everything should be on the table here, but it's really a matter of value. Those linear assets are even knowing cord cutting is happening, those are some very, very profitable businesses and they throw off a lot of cash. So the question would be, what's the-- if they're going to sell, what's the offer? What's the present value of that money versus looking at the profits these businesses throw off over time?DIANE KING HALL: And Peter, then speaking just more directly about Disney, what pieces of the business does it-- where it looks weaker where they need to sell that off?PETER LIGUORI: Look, I think Disney's pretty strong across the board. I don't think there is a need. Disney, much like Warner Brothers, much like Comcast with the Sky acquisition, each of these companies have a fair amount of debt. And you saw David and Gunnar at Warner Brothers do a very good job of figuring out how to activate their free cash flow. They prepaid some debt. They wound up with $100 million extra in free cash flow to activate in various elements of the business.So you know, I don't think there's any, quote-unquote, ""needs,"" but every one of the legacy media entities should be looking at their assets and seeing how they can be activated to take care of the balance sheet and invest in the future.- Peter, who are the buyers in this scenario? Who would want to own some of these assets?PETER LIGUORI: So traditionally, I think we've seen some of the private equity companies take a look at them. When I was at Tribune, we had Oaktree heavily involved in the station group. We've seen Apollo. So what private equity does is they sit there and they do value the cash flow that these businesses throw off. You know, it's a little bit more challenging when you try to combine station groups because you run into FTC issues.DIANE KING HALL: And Peter, I want to ask you about the strike, whether we're talking about both the writers and the actors strike. Right now it's been kind of accretive to these media companies. Paramount talking about some of the cash they've been able to serve as a result. But when does this become a problem? There was concern expressed ahead of some of these earnings coming out. When does this become a problem for these big media giants?PETER LIGUORI: Well, I think you have to work backwards. It becomes a problem when they start noticing a softening of advertising. It becomes a problem when they start softening viewership, usership, and subscribers-- subscriber growth. But we're not there yet. Look, there are 600 scripted shows out there right now. So there's always something fresh for someone to watch.Eventually, you do run out of something-- something new or something that speaks to you, but, you know, these are some smart people. They will get a deal done. What's going to be interesting, you know, about how this strike is handled is when you look at the studios, it's almost-- the challenge is almost three layers, three constituents. There's Netflix, which is kind of an Island unto itself, there is Silicon Valley, the Amazons of this world who have content kind of as an ancillary strategy, and then you have legacy media. So there kind of needs are a little bit different.And from the actors' and the writers' perspective, look, this is an existential issue when they're looking at AI. But I'm somewhat hopeful. You know, clearly, there was progress being made on the SAG front because they kept extending the negotiations. That means that there were practical issues that were being addressed and some progress being made, and I'm hopeful that the WGA will look at the DGA's agreement and say there's some analogous situations there that will lead to an issue-by-issue resolution for both sides.- Hopefully there is a resolution sooner rather than later. Peter Liguori, great to have you, Sunday Gravy Entertainment president.PETER LIGUORI: Thank you.]"

104,4cf23fd9-688d-3085-a37f-00f9c0f285ea,NFLX,2023-08-09,Disney’s earnings could either make it the streaming queen of the ball or just another struggling media company,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-earnings-could-either-streaming-185614899.html,1691520974,STORY,"['DIS', 'NFLX']","[It’s been a busy summer for Bob Iger. The Walt Disney CEO extended his contract, welcomed back two former executives as advisors, and briefly became the villain of the Hollywood strikes. Iger is on a four-year mission to turn Disney around, but early results are a mixed bag. Despite Wall Street’s longtime warmth toward the CEO, Disney’s stock has fallen 11% since he returned to the company in November, while the S&amp;P 500 index has swelled 13%.The company will report quarterly earnings Wednesday after market close. Better-than-expected results could give Disney a much-needed stock boost after its share price has been tumbling for two years, today worth less than half of its 2021 peak.Its earnings could also give the company a leg up over its competitors, which largely underperformed this quarter. Netflix’s quarterly earnings disappointed investors last month. Its revenue fell short of analyst estimates, and shares slid 9%. Warner Bros. Discovery also missed revenue expectations last week, and its total subscriber count took a hit. But its stock rose a modest 2.5% after the company reported paying off debt, increasing free cash flow, and naming a new savings target.The majority of analysts are optimistic on Disney’s stock future, with two-thirds of Wall Street analysts advising investors to buy the stock, according to Seeking Alpha. Their reasons include Disney’s recent cost-cutting measures and easing criticism from the political right and left. Analysts expect Disney to report $22.5 billion in revenue this quarter, up 3% from the previous quarter and 5% from the same time last year.“After disappointing Q2 results, the pressure for Disney to deliver on its bottom line is increasing,” Vladimir Dimitrov, a strategy consultant, wrote for Seeking Alpha. Last quarter, Disney missed profit estimates and lost 4 million Disney+ subscribers, or 2% of its count. The results this quarter will be “pivotal” to appeasing Wall Street, he said.Story continuesWhat will analysts focus on?All eyes will be on Disney’s streaming business, which Iger has made a top priority. Its properties include Disney+ and ESPN+, as well as a two-thirds stake in Hulu.Disney is in a competitive position in the streaming wars, with a subscriber count second only to Netflix. Disney’s combined properties boast 231 million subscribers, 158 million of which belong to Disney+. Netflix has 238 million. While Netflix makes the most revenue of any streaming business, Disney+ and Hulu follow.Streaming assets throughout the media industry aren’t yet profitable, with the exception of Netflix’s. Disney isn’t losing the most money, but it isn’t losing the least. Paramount, which owns Paramount+, has narrower losses than Disney’s business does, though it has a fraction of Disney’s subscriber count. In the year leading up to Disney’s most recent earnings announcement in May, the company lost $4.2 billion on its streaming business. During that same period, it made $87 billion in revenue. The company expects the segment to start earning a profit by the end of fiscal 2024, and any progress toward that goal, or signs of slippage, will be important.Disney’s plans for ESPN are also up in the air. The company is looking to sell a stake of the asset to a company that could help with content or distribution, Iger said last month. While the channel is still profitable, its numbers are on the decline, according to the New York Times. The news reflects a larger trend away from traditional television and toward streaming, which is causing media companies to revise their business models. The shift for ESPN is inevitable, Iger said on a call with analysts in February.Investors might also want to hear from Iger about the public relations mess he made for his remarks about the Hollywood writers and actors on strike. “There’s a level of expectation that they have that is just not realistic,” Iger said during an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box last month. He was speaking from the Sun Valley Conference in Idaho, the so-called billionaire’s summer camp. Celebrities and social media users were quick to point out the CEO is expected to make $27 million in 2023 and receive a pay increase next year, while calling the unions’ terms unrealistic. In the following days, Disney’s stock fell 5%.Actors and performers, represented by the SAG-AFTRA labor union, went on strike last month. They joined the union representing Hollywood writers, WGA, for the first time in 63 years. The unions and the trade association representing Hollywood studios couldn’t come to terms on wages, benefits, and the use of artificial intelligence.The work stoppage, which halted nearly all productions in Hollywood, could result in delayed film and television show releases in the coming months and years. But it is also contributing to major cost savings for studios. Due to the strikes, Warner Bros. Discovery saved at least $100 million during its most recent quarter, and Netflix expects an additional $1.5 billion in free cash flow by the end of the year, executives said during their recent earnings calls. If the trend continues, Disney could report an increase of cash on hand.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal joins the Live show to discuss the earnings performance for streamers Netflix (NFLX), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Paramount (PARA), and Disney (DIS) amid cost-cutting and cord-cutting trends in the industry. Canal also comments on the impact the ongoing Hollywood writers and actors' strikes are having on studios and production schedules.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, streaming giants have seen a mixed picture this earnings season amid a difficult ad backdrop and, of course, heightened competition. For some top takeaways, we're joined by Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Hey, Alex.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hey, Rochelle. And you put it perfectly, right? We have seen a mixed bag when it comes to these streaming facing media companies. We still have the biggie coming up tomorrow. Disney will report after the bell. But let's take a look at some of the top takeaways that we've seen so far.For me, number one would be that patience is a virtue for investors, especially when it comes to some of those revenue initiatives. And I'm going to call out Netflix here because we saw that company miss on revenue estimates with the outlook also disappointing. That initially caused a drop in shares immediately following the results.And that's despite the rollout that we've seen on that password sharing crackdown in addition to the ad supported tier. But both management as well as analysts on Wall Street have preached the long game here. The effect of those initiatives, that's going to play out in the quarters to come. So shareholders will have to practice patience there.But speaking of patience, we are finally starting to see some of those cost-cutting initiatives take effect, especially at companies like Paramount Global and Warner Bros Discovery, which have been especially challenged over the past year. We've seen a ton of layoffs. We've seen, you know, business restructurings, a dividend. Cut but those are starting to play out with Paramount reporting narrower streaming losses. For WBD, we also saw free cash flow improve, so that's a positive there.Story continuesBut I want to turn to the negative because the advertising environment, that continues to be a very significant headwind. Linear ad revenue, that declined by double digits for companies like Paramount and WBD. There does seem to be some hope that the back half of the year we could see some improvement, but that ultimately remains to be seen.And then finally, one last thing I want to call out is that double strike in Hollywood. We heard every single media executive talk about this. They desperately want the strikes to end. They have reshuffled their release calendars to account for the strike. But currently, there is no end in sight. And I think the longer we see this play out and if we continue to hear these conversations in Q3 and Q4, the outlook is going to be a lot more dim.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed and of course, Allie, earnings aren't quite over yet for the media giants. What can we expect from Disney?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Disney is going to have a bit of a challenge quarter. And there's a few things I want to call out here. We're going to see streaming losses that probably are going to continue to mount. The estimate here is for -$775 million. That's due to a slew of heavy marketing costs. Subscribers are also expected to once again drop by another 2.6 million after their Indian Hotstar brand lost the IPL Cricket League.And similar to other media giants, that ad market, that's expected to continue to hammer the bottom line and that linear network revenue, which we know is going to be closely watched on that earnings call. The one bright spot here could be the parks, but even there has been some question marks about the demand, especially as inflation remains high.And then on the film side, you know, we saw disappointing debuts for ""The Little Mermaid,"" for ""Elemental,"" so that could come in soft. And overarching is what's going to happen with ESPN, right? What-- who are those strategic partners? How are we going to take ESPN fully over the top? So a lot of questions that likely will be asked on that earnings call. We'll have it all for you tomorrow.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I appreciate that very much. Our very own Allie Canal with that breakdown there on all things media and streaming. Thanks so much.]"

AMGN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AMGNAmgen is a leading biotechnology-based human therapeutics company, with a historical focus on renal disease and cancer supportive-care products. Its flagship drugs include Epogen, Aranesp, Neupogen, Neulasta, Enbrel, and Otezla, among others. The company's current stock price is $261.97, which is close to its GF Value of $262.6. This suggests that the stock might be fairly valued. However, a more detailed analysis is necessary to confirm this.Is Amgen Inc (AMGN) Stock Fairly Valued?Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line, visible on our summary page, provides an overview of the stock's fair trading value.According to GuruFocus' valuation method, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) appears to be fairly valued. The GF Value estimates that the stock's fair value is based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $261.97 per share, Amgen stock is believed to be fairly valued.Because Amgen is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesIs Amgen Inc (AMGN) Stock Fairly Valued?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it's important to check its financial strength. Investing in companies with poor financial strength can lead to a higher risk of permanent loss. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a good understanding of a company's financial strength. Amgen has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.56, which is lower than 58.54% of companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. This indicates that the financial strength of Amgen is weak.Is Amgen Inc (AMGN) Stock Fairly Valued?Profitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually indicate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Amgen has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $26.60 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $14.83. Its operating margin is 35.72%, which ranks better than 97.2% of companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. This indicates strong profitability.Growth is one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. If a company's business is growing, it usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Amgen's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 57.38% of companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. However, Amgen's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 2.7%, which ranks worse than 62.42% of companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. This indicates somewhat weak growth.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Amgen's return on invested capital is 18.89, and its cost of capital is 6.93.Is Amgen Inc (AMGN) Stock Fairly Valued?ConclusionOverall, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock appears to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is poor, but its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks worse than 62.42% of companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.

Over the past decade, this ratio ranged from a low of 3.14 to a high of 27.08. Currently, it is at a competitive 10.09. This ratio reflects how the market values the company against its earnings.

When matched against the industry median of 3.49%, it is clear the company operates more efficiently than many of its competitors.Future prospectsEven though Foot Locker received two downgrades after the earnings report, it is important to remember the stock market is not always predictable. Difficulties can lead to rebounds, and this situation might pave the way for a resurgence. After all, every challenge offers an opportunity.Macy'sMacy's Inc. (NYSE:M) might be another great pick.

111,595c18f0-a52d-3a4a-bfcc-c9a922657b6b,GD,2023-08-09,General Dynamics Corporation's (NYSE:GD) Stock Has Shown A Decent Performance: Have Financials A Role To Play?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-corporations-nyse-gd-110053888.html,1691578853,STORY,['GD'],"[Most readers would already know that General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) stock increased by 7.9% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on General Dynamics'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is:17% = US$3.4b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of General Dynamics' Earnings Growth And 17% ROETo start with, General Dynamics' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Despite this, General Dynamics' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that General Dynamics' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 6.1% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is GD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is General Dynamics Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 41% (meaning the company retains59% of profits) in the last three-year period, General Dynamics' earnings growth was more or les flat. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Moreover, General Dynamics has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 38%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 20%.ConclusionIn total, it does look like General Dynamics has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The biotech company's results got a lift from Covid vaccine sales, but it was forced to cut its revenue guidance. Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the report.Video Transcript- Want to switch gears and look at the health care sector. Novavax is out with a surprise profit in the second quarter. The company also beating on the top line, but trimming back its full year revenue forecast for 2023. Here with the details on Novavax's latest quarterly results, we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Anje.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hey. Yeah. Thanks so much. You know, Novavax really is an interesting story, and I think definitely interest has waned in over time. But they really came out with a momentary surprise with that beat in revenue, and that comes from an advance purchase agreement with Canada that then came back to them in the total of $350 million. And that's what gave them that $58 million profit this time for this quarter alone.And you know, they do have that boost in revenue quarter over quarter. They did have to, though, downgrade their guidance for the year. And that's something that investors are definitely looking at, that downward guidance of about 100 million. They do still anticipate that they will have a decent commercialized market this fall. So they're looking at Q4 and saying that things are pretty much set when it comes to what the company needs to do.I got a chance to speak to the chief business officer as and executive Vice President John Trizzino about what has happened and pretty much what they expect, looking out for the year, what their thoughts are about, you know, the quarter and its strong results. And he told me, quote, ""I think we find ourselves in a much stronger financial position that we have than we have for the last two quarters.""And that's, you know, saying something in terms of not just the results now, but also what the company has been doing since the turnover, since the new CEO stepped in place, as well as that sort of revitalized relationship that they have with the FDA. So things are looking positive for the first time in a while for this company.]"

Yahoo Finance Live anchor Julie Hyman takes a look at several trending stocks in the morning trading session.Video Transcript- And we're a little more than 30 minutes into the trading day, so let's take a look at how stocks are moving. We are seeing the major averages in the red. That's due in part to the downgrade that we saw from Moody's for a slew of regional banks. Several big lenders also now on downgrade watch. The banking sector has been combating higher deposit and borrowing costs thanks to rising interest rates. So we are seeing the major averages under some pressure, although it is tech that is feeling the most pressure today.Shares of Novavax jumping this morning after the vaccine maker reported a surprise second quarter profit from its new COVID-19 vaccine. CEO John Jacobs tempering expectations for the near future though, noting there would be little to no sales of the shot in the next quarter. Novavax can only start rolling out vaccines once the FDA makes a decision on the new shot that's expected to come in late September.Hims &amp; Hers shares also on the up today after surging revenue led to narrowed losses in the second quarter. The company saw its subscribers jump from 748,000 to 1.3 million and also raised its full year revenue guidance as it announced the launch of its weight loss management business that's to come by the end of this year.And we are also watching Olaplex shares here those shares down by 17.5% after the company cut its full year guidance amid slumping demand.

We also appreciated your questions and the ongoing dialogue about the issues most important to you. As you know, we shared more detail about our growth strategy, innovative pipeline and the key franchises, capabilities and investments we are making to build on our competitive advantages as the world leader in animal health. The four tenets of our value proposition were affirmed and expanded on throughout the day, and you can expect us to revisit that framework and provide progress updates in future investor interactions. Our goal is always to ensure that you understand how we are positioned to deliver on our value proposition, the revenue growth, strategic investments, margin expansion and capital returns. With that covered, let's turn now to the second quarter financial results. Today, we reported strong second quarter results of 9% operational growth in revenue and 12% operational growth in adjusted net income based on our diverse portfolio across markets and species. As expected, we returned to a more balanced segment growth this quarter with 11% operational growth internationally and 7% growth in the U.S. Our companion animal portfolio grew 11% operationally, driven by our major franchises in dermatology, osteoarthritis pain and pet parasiticides. The second quarter results and drivers were more in line with our performance trends in recent years with innovations and strength in our companion animal portfolio leading the way. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 4% operationally in the second quarter, driven by sales of poultry, cattle and fish products, and continue to demonstrate the benefits of our diversified portfolio across species and geographies with a strong first half. Overall, the first half of 2023 has played out much as we expected. We have grown revenue 6% operationally in the first half, driven by strong results from our international markets and livestock performance, which were partially offset by the distributor destocking we explained in the first quarter. As expected, the impact of distributor destocking in our U.S. companion animal portfolio has stabilized and was not a significant factor in the second quarter. We continue to see strong customer demand for our companion animal portfolio. For the first half of 2023, companion animal grew 5% operationally. We believe companion animal should be a bigger driver of performance for the remainder of the year with a stronger second half driven by our key franchises. While we are monitoring how inflationary pressures may impact pet care spending in markets around the world, the underlying demand has remained steady and resilient to date, and this is what we have seen historically. In the U.S., veterinary clinic visits continue to stabilize, staying relatively flat through the first half of the year, and clinic revenue and spend per visit were both up about 9% in the U.S. in the first half. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally in the first half of 2023, reflecting strong growth internationally and continued supply recovery in our U.S. cattle products. We expect livestock growth for the full year to be in the low single digits operationally, reflecting tougher comparisons in the second half of the year for U.S. portfolio. With the first half of the year playing out largely as expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income. In our companion animal portfolio, we expect Librela and Solensia to continue to ramp up in various markets as we build our franchise for osteoarthritis pain. One way we are supporting growth for both products is increased use of direct-to-consumer campaigns in launch markets. These campaigns are building disease and product awareness, creating conversations among vets and pet owners and accelerating our efforts in markets where DTC is available. We're also pleased to have received U.S. regulatory approvals in the second quarter for Librela and for Apoquel chewable. Both have been performing well in markets outside the U.S. to date. Librela is expected to launch in the U.S. in November with an early experience trial beginning in September. As you look at the second half, we continue to expect strong growth even as we factor in uncertainty around the macroeconomic conditions and droughts that exist in certain countries around the globe, particularly Asia Pacific, and tougher comparisons for U.S. livestock portfolio in the U.S. As we have seen historically in these type of environments, our global footprint and diverse portfolio provide more stability to our business during uncertain times and we remain ready to pivot resources and investments to the greatest opportunity areas that it can ensure we continue to deliver on our commitments. For example, we continue to expand in large and growing product areas such as parasiticides, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies for pain, vaccines and diagnostics and invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, many of which we discussed at Investor Day. Before I wrap up, three quick points around our colleagues. First, I want to welcome Ester Banque to our Zoetis executive team as EVP and President of U.S. Operations. Ester joined us in July coming most recently from Bristol-Myers Squibb and having spent a major part of her career at Novartis as well. She brings diverse global experience in healthcare and an impressive track record of driving results to Zoetis and I'm happy to say she is already off and running with the U.S. business. I also wanted to call out the recent publication of our 2022 sustainability report. This year's report captures how sustainability is integrated across the business and shares the progress we are making toward our driven to care aspirations. This report honors our outstanding Zoetis colleagues who champion our purpose and work every day to make us the world's most trusted and valued animal health company. And finally, I wanted to mention a recent recognition from [Fast] Company, which named Zoetis as one of the best workplaces for innovators. Shaping animal care through innovation is something we have always done across the company and has been a key element of our success. This is a well-deserved honor for our culture and our people who continuously strive to solve critical unmet medical needs in animal health from chronic illnesses like osteoarthritis pain and allergic dermatitis for pets to emerging infectious diseases threatening the food supply. I'm truly proud of our colleagues for receiving this recognition.In conclusion, with a solid first half behind us, I remain very positive about achieving our full year guidance, thanks to the purpose-driven colleagues, innovation-driven culture and diverse portfolio that continues to drive our success. Thank you, and now let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny?Wetteny N. JosephThank you, Kristin, and good morning. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with balanced growth across both our companion animal and livestock portfolios as well as our U.S. and International segments. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $652 million grew 15% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth 4% is price and 5% is on volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from other in-line products, 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio. Companion animal products are the primary driver of growth this quarter, growing 11% operationally with lifestyle growing 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. For companion animal, our key dermatology portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting $355 million in revenue, our largest quarter ever and representing 14% growth on an operational basis. We saw double-digit operational growth in both international and the U.S. driven by strong growth in Cytopoint as well as growth driven by Apoquel and the conversion to (inaudible) in certain international markets. Our monocolantibodies, phosphatase pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia posted $69 million in revenue globally in the quarter with strong demand for both products as well as the impact of the launch of Librela in several new international markets. Our companion animal parasiticides also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by our well solution franchise, which had $103 million in revenue and grew 22% operationally. Simparica Trio also contributed to the parasiticides growth with $248 million of revenue and growth of 5% operationally. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $92 million in revenue in Q2, growing 12% operationally. We saw double-digit growth in the U.S. driven by high instrument placements in the quarter and disruptions from the implementation of our new field force model that impacted the prior year. Sales of our livestock products grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw growth across both our U.S. and international segments driven by poultry, cattle and fish. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal products growing 7% and livestock sales growing 5%. As Kristin mentioned, our companion animal performance in the quarter reflected the stabilization of the distributor inventory levels that were a headwind to our growth in Q1. U.S. vet visits were flat in the quarter. [Linked] revenue growth and average revenue per visit were both up 8%. These trends are in line with expectations and continue to reflect the stabilization post-COVID. Turning to U.S. product performance. Our key dermatology product sales were $241 million for the quarter, growing 10% and benefited from higher periodic patient visits in the quarter. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth with vets and pet owners showing a preference for injectables. Our U.S. small animal vaccines revenue grew 20% in the quarter, driven by higher sales of our canine influenza virus vaccine due in part to a competitor back order as well as higher sales into certain corporate and strategic accounts. The (inaudible) posted sales of [$213] million in the quarter, growing 2%. Growth was driven by inpatient demand across all channels, partially offset by a difficult comparison period given the timing of distributor shipments from last year during our supply challenges as well as aggressive competitive promotion in the current quarter. Our growth cadence for Trio across the year will be impacted by the timing of supply recovery in 2022, and we expect growth rate improvement in the second half. As expected, we received FDA approval for Librela in the U.S. in May. We look forward to starting our early experience program in late Q3 with an expected November launch. Now turning to U.S. livestock. We saw 5% growth in our lifestyle portfolio in the quarter, primarily from our cattle business where we saw significant growth in Jackson, resulting from a favorable comparative quarter last year when an anticipated midyear price reduction limited sales in the quarter. Additional U.S. cattle growth came from Synovex, which benefited from our reimplementation label claim. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also contributed to growth of 11%, based on our vaccine portfolio and an increased focus on egg layer market. We also benefited from favorable MFA rotations at certain large producers. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue was $1 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally in the quarter, while livestock revenue grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our small animal parasiticides, our monoclonal antibodies for Osteoarthritis pain and our key dermatology products. Our international parasiticide portfolio growth was primarily driven by a revolution franchise with $57 million in revenue, growing 52% operationally driven by the lack of supply last year, which particularly impacted China in the second quarter of 2022. Our Simparica franchise also contributed to growth with continued market share expansion, especially in Latin America, Europe and Asia. We continue to see strong adoption of Librela and Solensia. Librela generated $48 million in revenue with 89% operational growth in the quarter driven by strong growth in Europe, supported by our direct-to-consumer advertising efforts in major markets and recent launches in various international markets, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan. Solensia delivered $11 million of second quarter sales internationally, driven by higher demand and supported by direct-to-consumer marketing efforts. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 22% operationally. We continue to see double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by growth from and conversion to Apoquel chewable as well as from Cytopoint with higher compliance and new patients. Our growth also benefited from a weak comparative quarter in Japan, which was impacted by prepriced buy-ups in Q1 of last year. Moving on to our International Lifestyle portfolio, which grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our poultry portfolio performed well with growth driven by key account penetration and MFA rotations in core poultry markets, including Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Our fish portfolio continues to perform well as a result of increased sales of vaccines across salmon markets in Norway and Chile. Lastly, [Ocado] portfolio saw gains in Turkey, Brazil and Argentina from strong price growth and the recovery of supply issues. Now moving on to the rest of the P&amp;L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 72.4% improved 260 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from favorable foreign exchange, price increases and favorable product mix. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally with both SG&amp;A and R&amp;D growing 8% operationally driven primarily by headcount-related compensation costs due to the timing of new hires in 2022 and the impact of annual salary increases. The lower growth in R&amp;D expenses this quarter is reflective of the timing of spend in project investments and not a reduction in our expected R&amp;D spend for the full year. Year-to-date, adjusted R&amp;D expenses has grown 13% operationally. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, an increase of 80 basis points, driven by higher net discrete tax expenses in the quarter, mainly related to changes to prior year's tax positions and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. And finally, adjusted net income grew 12% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% operationally in the quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $166 million and continue to be on track with our expectations for the year. In the quarter, we repurchased $324 million of Zoetis shares. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July, beginning with revenue for the full year due to unfavorable foreign exchange we are slightly lowering our revenue range while maintaining our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.50 billion and $8.65 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. With the approval of Librela in the U.S., we are now including our projected sales for November and December in our guidance, which are expected to be immaterial to our overall operational growth rate. Their impact on the full year revenue is largely offset by potential uncertainty in China as well as broader macroeconomic conditions in certain markets. Operationally, the first half has played out largely as we expected with 6% operational revenue growth. We expect stronger growth in the second half of the year overall, especially in our U.S. companion animal business. In livestock, which has grown 8% year-to-date on an operational basis. We anticipate unfavorable comparisons in the second half, driven by the timing of price decreases in Jackson in the U.S. last year, and the resumption of supply of several products after outages in the first half of 2022. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.50 billion to $2.55 billion, slightly above our previous guidance while maintaining our previous guidance of operational growth of 7% to 9%, driven by foreign exchange favorability in cost of sales and expenses, which were partially offset by unfavorability in revenue. Reported diluted EPS increases to a range of $5.15 to $5.27, which is impacted by foreign exchange and a onetime gain from a business development deal. And finally, due to the impact of foreign exchange, we are increasing adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.37 to $5.47. Just to summarize before we go to Q&amp;A. We saw strong well based growth in the second quarter, growing in both companion animal and livestock as well as in the U.S. and internationally, with contributions from price and volume. We expect stronger growth as we move into the second half. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our operational full year guidance commitments. We continue to see improving fundamentals in the overall industry and remain committed to delivering on our value proposition to grow revenue faster than the market and to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.Michael Leonidovich RyskinI want to start with Trio real quickly. We've seen -- we finally see NexGard PLUS approved in the U.S. from Bonerngeheim. I just want to ask, how do you see this market playing out? There's a lot of debate on the label differences Trio versus NexGard PLUS, the 6 month versus 1 month warm detail as well as how it's going to be priced with the promotions being put out at the start of the launch. So what are your expectations for Trio now that the competition is finally here both for second half and for 2024. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up. I want to ask on Librela. It continues to be really well OUS, I think it's on track for over $200 million this year from OUS alone. Any learnings or changes to your assumptions now that you can take that into the U.S. launch. Fair to say that it could be incremental $75 million, $100 million for revenues next year?Kristin C. PeckSure. Thanks, Mike. I'll start with the first question and let Wetteny follow up on Librela. Yes, as we saw the -- this was the label for NexGard PLUS was largely what we expected. I think Simparica Trio clearly has a superior label, and it was first to market. Right now Simparica Trio is #1 in companion animal pairs in the U.S. As you look at where we are, we've had 3 years of demonstrated efficacy and experience with this product. And we'll clearly leverage our retail auto ship to continue that. As you look at your NexGard PLUS, it obviously does not, as you saw, have heartworm from first dose -- it has 4 ticks versus 5. It doesn't yet have a label to prevent line. It has a lower minimum weight. So we really do think we have a strength in our Simparica Trio label -- will be aggressive, obviously, in competing against them. We are expecting a much stronger Q3 for the product based on comparable. So we expect a strong second half for us. We are expecting significant promos. We watch them do this before. This is something BI does often. So beyond the promos, we think we can be very competitive with our product based on the strength of our label, the strength of the experience with the product. Our relationships clearly with the corporates and really with a very pleased head owner who's on this product. So obviously, we're ready for some significant competition, but we remain very confident overall and our strength in Paris, and we see a stronger growth obviously in the next quarter and the second half for Paris overall. But Wetteny, do you want to take this question on Librela?Wetteny N. JosephSure. Mike, thanks for the question. Look, we remain really on track with EU performance, and we're very pleased to see $48 million of Librela revenues in the quarter, up 89% versus the prior year. We also launched a product in a number of new markets in our International segment including Japan, Australia, Brazil and Canada. Those contributed about $10 million for the quarter. So we continue to see really strong demand for the product, and we are starting to initiate DTC campaigns, which will continue to drive awareness across both Librela and Solensia in our markets. It is already, as we said last year, the #1 Osteoarthritis pain product in the EU. Look, we won't necessarily get into what the expectations are for next year. Obviously, we'll do that as we get into guidance for the year. We're expecting to continue to see strong growth for Librela on the balance of the year. I will note, last year, we did see a bit of an uptick in the third quarter. That was, as we released the allocations that we're on, and we [soft Lenox] order a bit more. That was offset in Q4. So just a little bit of a dynamic to Q3 and Q4. But really with the new markets as well as continued growth in EU, we're expecting very strong growth in the third quarter as well.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sense.Nathan Allen RichFirst, Wetteny, I wanted to start with the outlook for companion. I think you had talked about it improving in the back half of the year. Was that relative to the 5% growth in the first half? Or is that relative to the second quarter growth, which is obviously higher. Any context you can kind of provide as well on just kind of cadence through Q2 versus 4Q would be helpful. And then just a follow-up on the commentary on Trio. Could you maybe just talk about the 2% operational growth and the different factors that impacted that in the quarter and then the kind of type of growth that you would expect in the back half of the year, just given the competitive launch that you mentioned as well as maybe a normalization of supply.Wetteny N. JosephYes, I'd be happy to take this and see what Kristin wants to add. With respect to companion animal, as we said, and I think you saw us really reiterate our guidance from an operational perspective 6% to 8%. Now while livestock has seen about 8% growth in the first half. We saw 4% growth in livestock in the second quarter operationally. We are expecting -- as we said in the prepared commentary, livestock to come in, in the low single-digit range. So I think you can clearly see that the growth in the back half of the year is going to be significantly driven companion animal. And as we said also, given the timing of supply in 2022, we're facing -- relatively speaking, an easier comp in the U.S. companion animal business in the third quarter versus, say, the fourth quarter. So I think those will play out in terms of how you get -- how you map out to our guidance set on an operational perspective, being largely driven by companion animal in the back half of the year. I think overall, not just from a companion animal perspective, overall, I would expect the third quarter to be another strong quarter for us. I would expect us to come in somewhere between the mid and high end of our annual range. We said after last quarter, given the distributor destocking impact to think a normalized growth for the rest of the year which would translate to somewhere -- if you just pick the midpoint of our guidance, that will be around 8%. We came in slightly above that, really in line with our expectations on the quarter. And so you can map out what that means for the rest of the year, but I would expect Q3 to be slightly above Q4 given what I just shared from a companion animal perspective, versus less like that has a tougher comp in the third quarter, particularly in the U.S. Trio, like Kristin said, we're starting very strong quarter in third quarter despite the competitive launch, which we believe to be imminent here. Part of that is the cadence last year. I think the rhythm of supply last year clearly had an impact where we saw a bigger Q2 last year than in Q3. So I think you're going to see that play out with respect to Trio growth. And given the first-mover advantages that we have with Trio that's been in the market for over 3 years and our confidence in terms of our label, et cetera, we expect to see continued growth across Trio and a strong year for the year for sure.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel.Jonathan David BlockI'll [suppose] the front. I guess the first one, just any color on the gross margin. We I think the 2Q '23 gross margin, I believe, might have been the best in the company's history. So maybe you could talk about the drivers there and more importantly, are some of those drivers sustainable? And then the second question might build a little bit on a prior question, which is, is Trio the modest, call it, downside driver of the implied companion animal '23 growth? Because I think I've got it right. Essentially, livestock went from flattish to up low single digits. Obviously, overall operational stayed unchanged at 6% to 8%. So the implied CA came down a bit -- do we think about Trio being responsible for that? And maybe just a byproduct of some of the promotions that you called out earlier?Wetteny N. JosephYes. Look, with respect to gross margin, you saw 72.4% gross margin on the quarter up in Q2. That's up about 260 basis points versus last year. FX is about 200 basis points of that. And clearly, we've pegged our overall guidance on FX based on where rates were at the end of July. So I'm not going to venture to forecast what that might mean. But in terms of the other components that are driving our gross margin, price and mix, certainly were favorable for us. And as we've just discussed with respect to livestock having a tougher comp in the back half versus companion anal particularly into the third quarter. I expect price and mix to continue to contribute favorably here. The other element, of course, is really manufacturing, higher manufacturing costs. I think typically, what you see is this first half is a little bit higher for us than the second half. Part of that is the mix with respect to cattle run in the fall that tends to have a little bit of a mix down on us overall. But I would say the overall mix for the company, given the back half strength in companion animal is going to be -- continue to be favorable. So we see that being something that will consistently sustain. And again, we won't get into next year's element until we get there. With respect to the second half, look, clearly, our expectations which will remain that we'll see strong growth contribution for Trio and we're going to see a very strong third quarter. I think some of the -- and by the way, the year has played out, as we said, we gave a range of 6% to 8% operationally, sitting here today after delivering a very strong second quarter, we remain in line with our expectations for the year at 6% to 8%. I think if you look at some of the areas that we're watching from a macro perspective, China is one of them. I think if you look at the data coming out of China, confidence levels from consumers are low, the savings rates are very high. And so we're watching that as well as the impact it has on the Southeast Asia region given the tourism impact that China has on that region. That's one of the areas. Certainly, we're watching here in terms of what goes into our -- our thinking with respect to the balance of the year.Kristin C. PeckYes. I just want to reiterate, it is not -- I would not call it Trio what is driving any change in the second half. I really want to emphasize with what you said and what we said in our remarks. It really is, as we're looking at uncertainties with China, Southeast Asia, Australia with the drought. So I mean, as always, when you run a large global company, I think the advantage of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio and the durability. And that's by market, that's by species, and that's by therapeutic area. So we are obviously seeing a strength in a lot of areas, but obviously, uncertainties remain in China, Southeast Asia and certainly in some other markets around the world, certain ones such as if you look at, say, Spain, et cetera, which has got high inflation and weather issues as well. So I would say, I just want to be very clear. I don't think your characterization of Trio specifically repairs is the concern in the second half. It is much more around some of these macroeconomic and geopolitical and weather uncertainties that we're seeing in certain markets.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Westenberg with Piper Sandler.David Michael WestenbergSo can you talk about the [derm] market in 2024? I'm not talking necessarily, but you're specifically, but how you expect growth in monoclonals versus growth in small molecule with an incoming competitor. And if I could just squeeze in one really short one. Just want to confirm, Librela U.S. is not in the 2023 guidance.Kristin C. PeckSure. I can start with your second. Yes, Librela U.S. is in, as we did note, obviously, in Wetteny's remarks. But to get to your question on Derm and when, you can certainly follow up with you once on the derm (inaudible) Librela question. But we have led the way, as you know, in dermatology with both a small molecule and large molecule. We've been driving awareness through DTC. We still think there's significant market potential here in developed and emerging markets. There's still plenty of dogs that are untreated here. We're really focusing on investing in direct-to-consumer branded in the U.S. and in some markets and unbranded outside. With that, if you're seeing this year, we're looking at double-digit growth. In Q2, we had 14% growth with double-digit growth in both products in the quarter, so real strength. And we're continuing to innovate here. I think you saw also approval for Apoquel-2 in the U.S. We'll look for long-acting Cytopoint, look at species we are expecting obviously competition. We've been expecting it for a while. We'll say again, we're expecting it in 2024, and we'll see what happens. But we really are seeing more of a preference from both the vet and the pet owner moving more to Cytopoint for compliance reasons, obviously, for [E]. So I think we'll continue to see that. So we're seeing very strong growth in dermatology. Again, we're expecting double digits for the year. In the quarter, we had great strength against both, but I would like to be clear that as we're seeing do we think will grow faster. We're seeing greater focus from the vet and the pet owner on Cytopoint being a greater driver of our overall dermatology franchise, but really expect to follow that up with strong innovation continuing in what we think is a really important space, Wetteny do you want to add anything on Derma's question or Librela?Wetteny N. JosephYes. Look, I think clearly, a really strong quarter for us in derm in the second quarter, and we are expecting another strong quarter and strong back half for Derm across and Cytopoint driving that as well. And just with respect to Librela, I just wanted to add a little bit of color in terms of our thinking there. Certainly, very pleased to have received approval in May. But really, consistent with our expectations, we've been sharing for the last, I think, 2 or 3 quarters, we've been expecting an approval to be -- to come in the first half of this year followed by an early experience program and then the launch late in the year is what we've been saying. We remain on track with that. We are planning to begin the early experience program next month with the launch of [Polo] somewhere in the November time frame. Given the holidays and what's typically a little bit slower time frame with respect to clinics, et cetera, we're not expecting the contribution here to be significant to the growth for the year. And look, we continue to see great performance outside the U.S., and we're launching in other markets as well in line with our expectations as I shared a little bit earlier with an 89% growth rate on Librela on the quarter. And so we have factored that into the guidance here, but again, not a significant contribution.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.Brandon VazquezJust first on EPS and guidance. I just wanted to clarify the beat was pretty strong in the quarter, I think about [$0.09] relative to (inaudible) . EPS at the midpoint for guidance came up 3 points and just clarify, is that entirely the delta between those two is that entirely FX? Or is there anything else there we should be keeping in mind? And then as we think of the rest of the year kind of following up on that guidance, I think you said 4% pricing in the quarter. Can you just remind us when some of these pricing increases came in, does the benefit of pricing kind of slow down in the back half? And does that imply any improvements in volume and guidance?Wetteny N. JosephYes, happy to answer. Look, as we said, we really reflected two things in our guidance today is, as you said, in fact, last quarter, FX was an area that we're watching, given the volatility that we're seeing across certain currencies that we operate in and so we've updated guidance for FX both at the revenue line, which is negative. About -- it's about 75 basis points of growth essentially on a reported basis, that's just impacting FX. So we reflected that here but it's actually a positive contribution when you come down to EPS to the tune of about $0.03. So what you're seeing there from an adjusted basis is really all FX. From a reported standpoint, we're also reflecting some gains that we saw from a couple of BD deals that are elevating the reported rate from an EPS perspective. The only other color I would ask -- add here with respect to the second half from the cadence is, again, we're expecting a very strong second half from a companion animal perspective, versus lifestyle of the comps. I think if you look at the third quarter, we probably saw a bit lower OpEx in the prior year versus the fourth quarter. So I would expect OpEx will also be a little bit higher in Q3 versus Q4 as you look at the balance of the year. But other than that, I think price is something we typically do early in the year. There are certain markets where we may do a midyear price increase as well. But overall, price is something that happens fairly early in the year and pretty consistent with what you've seen in our numbers today.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.Christopher Thomas SchottThis is Katerina on for Chris. So first question, on dermatology, can you just remind us where you are in terms of life cycle management, any additional color that you kind of see with the dermatology portfolio kind of evolving over the next several years in terms of maybe potential new mechanisms or mode of administration and then the second question is on Europe. You obviously had a very strong quarter for companion ex U.S. this quarter. Can you just elaborate a bit on the trends that you're seeing there and how you see them holding up in the second half of the year?Kristin C. PeckSure. Thanks, Katerina. I'll take your questions and see if Wetteny wants to build on it. Life cycle innovation, obviously, is critical in dermatology -- we're quite focused on it in a number of areas. I think you saw approval in May of -- or in the quarter of Apoquel Chewable which we had approved outside the U.S., but now got approved in the U.S. This is really important for a lot of pet owners who have trouble getting their dogs to take pills. So a chewable has real value there. We're also looking at monoclonal antibodies, looking at more long acting in that space. We're also looking at life cycle innovation around other species. Clearly, dermatology is a significant issue amongst many companion animals. So we'll continue to look for opportunities there. It is a big market. We will continue to lead in innovation and in life cycle innovation across a number of different areas. I said, from small molecules to monoclonal antibodies to additional species. So we are really focused there. As you look at Europe, I mean, I think for most companies that we say, the growth in Europe was ahead of what many of us expected for the year, mostly because I think we were expecting energy to be a much bigger issue certainly through the winter, et cetera. But we've seen a great strength, particularly in Northern Europe. But I would say that if you look at Southern Europe, I don't think it's performing as well as Northern Europe. They've got greater inflationary markets there as well as a number of weather issues with severe heat waves and drought across markets like Spain. But we really see the underlying demand in Europe and Northern Europe remaining strong, and we're seeing strong growth there. So I'm not sure, Wetteny, what new way if you want to build on any of those comments.Wetteny N. JosephYes. Look, I think just stepping back from a companion animal performance perspective, we've continued to see strength there across our international markets. Even in emerging markets, I was just in Poland recently. You're seeing a real uptick in terms of companion animal continuing to take hold. I think some of the innovation that we have may take some time to take hold in other markets outside the U.S. and it takes longer to get to those peak sales. We're continuing to see really strong derm growth across our international markets and so on. So we believe that is sustainable. The first half, we've seen really strong growth there in terms of companion animal. Across international, we saw 17% operational growth in companion animal in the quarter following a 10% growth in Q1. I would continue to expect double-digit growth, maybe not at the level we saw in Q2 in the back half for international, we continue to see double-digit growth there.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor.Louise Alesandra ChenSo I want to ask you some of the pushes and pulls to your commitment to the mid- to high single-digit revenue growth that you've talked about over the next 3 to 5 years?Kristin C. PeckSure. Thanks, Louise. We remain committed to the guidance we provided at Investor Day back in May. We really -- I would start with just the resiliency of the animal health industry. The industry itself, historically, as you know, grows at 4% to 6%. We see really strong tailwinds driving the industry over the next medium to long term, increasing medicalization, especially in emerging markets, increases in population, really, the strength of the human animal bond. We're seeing increasing willingness to pay with 86% of pet owners say they'll pay whatever it takes to take care of their pet. But really where I think it differentiates Zoetis' innovation. Our innovation across chronic diseases. We look at -- what we can do as we talked about some of our new franchises that we think we'll build over that time period as well. We look at an increasing global population, which is obviously driving the need for more sustainable ways of producing agriculture and meats and proteins, so we really think Zoetis will continue to outperform a market growing 4% to 6%. Historically, we've outperformed close to 3%. And Zoetis is well diversified, and we're the innovation leader. We've got strong franchises today that are continuing to grow. Dermatology to be set, again this year are growing double digit, parasiticides, OA pain. We've got strong diagnostics, emerging markets. So we really believe the industry is very attractive and very resilient. But most importantly, I think Zoetis as a leader in innovation will continue to drive this important space.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays.Unidentified AnalystGood morning. This is [Shah] on for Balaji. A quick one on the global parasiticides market. On the Investor Day, you expect the global parasiticides market to expand from $6.3 billion in 2022 to around $10 billion to $12 billion by 2032, which implies a CAGR of around 6%. You also mentioned that Zoetis expect to grow faster than the market in this segment. So would you give us above half range of the market share of Zoetis's parasiticide business in the next 3 to 5 years? How much your future growth in this segment will be supported by new product launch and how much will be supported by revenue growth of Trio and Revolution [Plus]?Kristin C. PeckSure. Thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll let obviously Wetteny build there. We are the leader in parasiticides. We're really proud of that. We really see this as an important franchise. We have a broad set of products from Revolution to ProHeart to Simparica to Simparica Trio. We will be continuing to innovate in this important area. It is, by far, as you talked about, the largest therapeutic area in animal health. We really see a few things. Obviously, we're going to lead with innovation. We're going to lead with innovation in products that are easy to use, that really meet the customer demand as well as what our veterinarians are looking for. And we believe there's continued innovation in the space. We're looking at long actives, we're looking at injectables. We're looking at other combinations. Controlling parasites is critical to the overall health of the animal because if you don't, it creates lots of other issues for animals. So we'll continue to grow in this important space. We think it will continue to be a major contributor to Zoetis' growth over the time period. So I don't know Wetteny, you want to add anything there?Wetteny N. JosephYes. Look, what I would say is parasiticide is the biggest sort of market segment within Animal Health. It's also a very competitive space. Now if you look at Trio combination, all medications, these are relatively new standard of care, and we're going to continue to see those expand the market with respect to the number of doses as well as from a price perspective. And this is the area that we play we play in the oral space largely. And so I would expect us to grow faster than the market. But again, it's a competitive space, and we'll continue to innovate as others do as well.Kristin C. PeckYes. The only thing I'd also add there is that the one other growth that we haven't talked about much today is increase in compliance. I think if you look at retail and auto ship and injectables, I think right now, if you believe that the research will show you the average pet is really on at [bed] 6 to 7 months, when they should be on 12 months for many of these products. So I think if we can do a better job of driving compliance either through auto ship, on e-commerce or home delivery through the vet or as well as injectables where you can guarantee compliance. So we think there's lots of potential growth drivers for Zoetis to continue to drive this market and take share.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.Unidentified AnalystThis is Chris on for Steve. We had two questions. First, on the U.S. pet health market. You mentioned U.S. that visits were flat. In the quarter, is this capacity driven? Or is it more related to demand and weakening new patient visits and wellness visits? And then second, do you expect any headwind from the restart of student loan repayments this fall?Kristin C. PeckSure. Thanks. As you look at the vet visits, they -- we really have seen them, on average, be flattish for the first half of the year. But to be clear, they're still ahead of where they were pre-pandemic, we do not see that as a demand issue. As we've talked about on previous calls, it's really more of a supply issue in the sense of the veterinary workforce challenges. We're working hard to partner with vets to help address this. Certainly, we're finding new efficiencies in their clinic helping to support as we can, adding more vet tech, et cetera, financial support, you name it, to support it. But we are not seeing any concerns around demand for veterinary healthcare. We're really focused on making sure that the supply is there. So no, we are not seeing , we don't look at the flat bit visits and have a cause for concern. Historically, just so you know, that visits have been, give or take, flat to 1-ish historically. So this is not really concerning. And if you look at the first half of the year, saw a 9% increase in both average revenue per visit and revenue overall in the clinic. So we're continuing to see really strong demand for veterinary care and for our product, and we don't really see that changing. And now on your second question on headwinds from student loan, we're not expecting that to be a significant driver for us in the back half of this year or 2024. Thank you.OperatorAt this time, we have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the floor over to Kristin Peck for any additional or closing remarks.Kristin C. PeckGreat. Thank you all for your questions today, and importantly, for your continued interest in Zoetis. Looking ahead, we really want to underscore that we remain confident in our full year guidance really because of sustainable underlying demand for animal health, as we just talked about, especially in uncertain times. We believe that the enduring strength of the human animal bond, their willingness to spend on pet health and the essential need for a safe and affordable food supply are all fundamental drivers of our growth. And I believe no one in the industry has a stronger set of capabilities and colleagues when it comes to meeting these customer needs, to advancing animal care and to creating shareholder value. So we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, and thank you for your time today. Have a great day.OperatorThis does conclude the Zoetis Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.]"

In the year-ago quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.20 per share.Total revenues grew 6% year over year to $2.2 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 billion, in the reported quarter.Shares of Zoetis have gained 23.3% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s 3.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly HighlightsZoetis derives the majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. The company reports business results under two geographical operating segments — the United States and International.Revenues from the U.S. segment increased 7% year over year to $1.165 billion in the second quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.174 billion. The reported figure beat our estimate of $1.156 billion in total U.S. revenues.Sales of companion animal products in the U.S. region rose 7% from the prior-year quarter’s level due to increased sales of the company’s key dermatology portfolio, including Apoqueland Cytopoint. Growth in the sales of Zoetis’ vaccine portfolio and Solensia, a monoclonal antibody product for osteoarthritis pain in cats, also contributed to the increased revenues in the second quarter.Sales of livestock products surged 5% year over year in the reported quarter, fueled by an increase in cattle product sales like Draxxin and implant product Synovex. Revenues from poultry products also increased, driven by the sales growth of vaccines and medicated feed additives.However, the growth trend in revenues was partially offset by a decline in swine product revenues due to lower disease prevalence.Revenues in the International segment improved 6% year over year and 11% on an operational basis to $995 million in the second quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $980 million. The reported figure missed our estimate of $998 million in total International revenues.Story continuesSales of companion animal products grew 13% on a reported basis and 17% on an operational basis, driven by growth in several key products. These include monoclonal antibody products for osteoarthritis pain— Librela for dogs and Solensia for cats, dermatology products – Apoquel and Cytopoint as well as Zoetis’ new parasiticide products – Revolution/Stronghold and the Simparica Trio.On a year-over-year basis, livestock product sales declined 1% on a reported basis and 4% operationally. Growth in the cattle portfolio was driven by expansion as well as rotating medicated feed additives into core poultry markets like Latin America, the European Union and the Middle East.In the second quarter, Zoetis’ fish portfolio also witnessed an uptick in sales on the back of increased sales of vaccines across key salmon markets, primarily Norway and Chile. Livestock product sales in this segment increased during the quarter due to pricing in hyperinflationary markets and supply recovery, partially offset by pricing in hyperinflationary markets and supply recovery.Swine product sales suffered a decline in the International segment as well, owing to supply constraints in Western Europe.2023 Financial GuidanceZoetis updated its previously issued guidance for 2023.Revenues are now projected in the range of $8.500-$8.650 billion (previously $8.575-$8.725 billion), adjusting the impact of foreign exchange rates, although maintaining expected operational growth of 6-8%.The company now expects adjusted earnings in the band of $5.37-$5.47 per share (previously $5.34-$5.44 per share) for full-year 2023.Our TakeZoetis’ earnings exceeded both earnings and revenue estimates in the reported quarter.The bottom-line performance can be attributed to the strong uptake of livestock products. ZTS expects to continue witnessing growth due to the persistent strength of the pet care portfolio, key dermatology products and the company’s efforts to penetrate new markets.During the quarter, the FDA approved Apoquel Chewable tablets in the United States for controlling pruritus related to allergic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis in dogs at least 12 months of age. Apoquel chewable is the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs in the United States. This has likely contributed to the strong performance of the drug during the reported quarter.Zoetis Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZoetis Inc.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions are other members of our management team, including the heads of Home, Smart Home Business and Policy. Just over a month ago, we held our Investor Day, where we provided an update on our long-term consumer strategy. We outlined the strength of our core energy business, how the acquisition of Vivint further enhances our energy platform and position us to capitalize on the convergence of electricity and smart technologies in the home. Today, I am going to focus on the results for the second quarter, starting on Slide 4 with our 3 key messages. First, our business delivered strong quarterly results, and we are now trending towards the end -- the high end of our 2023 EBITDA guidance range. Next, the Vivint Smart Home integration is well underway, and we are realizing early wins in our combined sales efforts. Finally, we are executing on our consumer strategy to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Moving to the second quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered top decile safety performance and $819 million of adjusted EBITDA, a 112% increase from the same period last year, driven by excellent performance on our core energy business and the addition of Vivint Smart Home. Bruce will provide additional details on specific drivers, but our business benefited from strong plant operations, our enhanced supply strategy, customer growth and favorable market conditions. During the quarter, we began the integration of Vivint Smart Home, which has yielded solid early results. Our revenue and cost synergy programs are well underway, and we are reaffirming the full plan targets. As a result of early wins in our growth initiatives, we are increasing our 2023 growth target to $60 million, doubling our previous expectation. Finally, we hosted our Investor Day in June, which included our 5-year strategic plan and an update on our capital allocation framework. As a result of the sale of South Texas Project and our revised capital allocation plan, we are executing on a $2.7 billion share repurchase authorization and a $2.6 billion debt reduction plan. Through July, we were able to complete $50 million of share repurchases and $200 million of debt reduction. As a result of the strong quarterly results and our position for the rest of the year, we are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance, with our EBITDA currently trading at the higher end of the range. Now turning to Slide 6 for an update on our Energy business. ERCOT has experienced record peak demand this summer, demonstrating robust load growth in our core Texas region on a weather-normalized basis. The electric grid has been stable through these record demand. During the quarter, thermal and wind generation performed close to expected levels, which kept our prices relatively muted. As I mentioned during Investor Day, we implemented changes to our supply strategy that have worked well for us. We were more conservative on our plant operations and took additional maintenance outages that resulted in better performance from our fleet. We also purchased additional power above our expected low to give us more cushion against extreme weather. All of these have positioned us well this summer and for balance of the year. Parish Unit 8 is in testing mode and expected to come back to full service by the end of this month. On the regulatory front, the PUCT last week approved a much discussed bridge solution, which establishes positive price floors at various levels of operating reserves. This eliminates negative pricing during many hours and should help existing dispatchable units. Looking forward, ERCOT and the PUCT are moving ahead with the market design changes stemming from the recent legislative session. These changes were meant to increase reliability and incentivize new dispatchable generation. Key among these programs is PCM, the Performance Credit Mechanism, which will now go through our rule-making process prior to being implemented. Another major program coming from the legislator was the Texas Energy Fund, a program of low interest rate loans and completion bonuses for new generation. Prior to its implementation, the Texas Energy Fund must first be approved as a ballot measure by the public in November election. On Slide 7, we are introducing our new scorecard for the growth and cost initiatives. These will be updated on a quarterly basis with our progress. I have been very impressed with the level of collaboration and integration between our Energy and Smart Home teams. During the Investor Day, we discussed the makeup of our $300 million growth program, 50% coming from organic growth at historical levels and 50% from cross-sell activities. For the quarter, Energy and Smart Home grew at historical target levels and in line with our plan. For the cross-sell activities, we have seen some early successes. As such, we are increasing our growth target in 2023 from $30 million to $60 million. Our Energy and Smart Home call centers have begun transferring more leads to each other, and we are seeing positive customer conversion rates on qualified leads of around 6%. And with the addition of the DIY system introduced during the quarter, conversion rates are now moving closer to 10%, as this system is a good entry point to upsell and create more stickiness with the customer. One of the best examples of cross-selling and leveraging capabilities across NRG is the Vivint Protection Plan. This is an equipment protection plan that leverages NRG's current capabilities. Vivint launched this program in the second quarter, and we are already at 120,000 plans sold. This is a new revenue stream with very little cost. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to continue testing different bundles and offers before we scale it up in 2024. We are very encouraged on what we're seeing across the 2 businesses and the opportunities that are arising inside the home. One of the commitments during our Investor Day was to provide additional disclosures on our Vivint Smart Home business. On Slide 8, we have provided key performance indicators comparing quarter-over-quarter. As you can see, we have performed exceptionally well during the quarter, with subscribers growing 7% and recurring service margins up 9%. Our customers are engaging more with our platform and are staying for a longer period of time. Acquisition costs are higher due to the impact of higher interest rates and more products being sold, but they were more than offset by higher revenue on new subscribers. Overall, the profitability of the business is very strong. On the right-hand side is our Vivint Smart Home pro forma free cash flow projection through 2025. Our target is to grow customer count in line with historical performance around 7%, while we continue to increase margin contribution and reduce overall cost of acquiring and servicing customers. We expect to more than triple the cash flow generator from the business over the next 3 years. It will provide NRG an earnings stream that is stable, predictable over a long period of time, and importantly, diversified from our current Energy business. Turning to Slide 9. Our Investor Day focused on our commitment to operating excellence, disciplined growth and maximizing shareholder returns. I want to provide you some of the key highlights of the event: We outlined a 3-part strategic plan to optimize our Integrated Energy model, grow Energy and Smart Home and increased return of capital while achieving an investment-grade balance sheet. Our Integrated Energy model has evolved in the last 7 years, providing more durable earnings. We have strengthened our supply portfolio with the right mix of assets to better serve our customer load. The recent sale of our interest in South Texas Project is a great example of our ability to optimize our platform and maximize shareholder value through monetizing an asset whose attributes can be readily replicated and replaced in the market. At the same time, we are signing renewable PPAs and evaluating dispatchable capacity development projects that better match our hedging needs. We outlined our growth program for Energy and Smart Home, capitalizing on the convergence of electricity and smart technologies inside the home. We are going to use Vivint Smart Home technology platform to connect all of our products and services into a seamless experience for our customers. These will result in higher customer lifetime value. Finally, we announced an update to our capital allocation framework, with 80% of capital available for allocation now returned to shareholders. With the acquisition of Vivint complete, we have line of sight to the investment needs of the company going forward with growth investments using only 20% of capital available for allocation. Consistent with this change, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $2.7 billion to be completed through 2025. We also accelerated the achievement of our investment-grade credit metrics targets to 2025. I will pass it over to Bruce for the financial review.Bruce ChungThank you, Mauricio. NRG built on a solid first quarter, with strong results in the second quarter that materially exceeded performance from last year. The company generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $819 million in the quarter, which is $433 million higher than the second quarter of 2022. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, legacy NRG results once again included the impact of asset sales and retirements in the second quarter of 2022, totaling $30 million. The quarter also reflected $60 million of benefit compared to 2Q 2022 from the reversal of transitory items such as coal constraints and increased ancillary expenses. Strong performance in our core Energy business resulted in $186 million of uplift from the prior year. That uplift was driven by lower supply costs and improved plant performance relative to 2022. Finally, the remaining year-over-year increase to consolidated results is attributable to Vivint EBITDA of $217 million, which was not included in our 2022 results. Looking at our segments, and starting with Texas, adjusted EBITDA increased by $241 million versus the prior year on the back of higher gross margin of $273 million. As outlined earlier, meaningful unit margin expansion from lower supply costs, coupled with improved plant performance, were the primary drivers for the increase in gross margin. This increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased OpEx from the timing of planned outages and higher insurance premiums. In the East/West segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $25 million versus last year, driven primarily by asset sales and retirements. Similar to Texas, gross margin increased year-over-year and lower power supply costs more than offset the negative impact of volume declines due to mild weather. In Q2, Vivint continued to deliver strong financial results, contributing $217 million in adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew 12% year-over-year driven by favorable retention and higher recurring monthly revenue per subscriber, which combined with reductions in monthly service cost per customer, drove a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to Q2 2022. Lastly, with average subscriber growth of 7% year-over-year, Vivint recently achieved a key milestone, surpassing 2 million customers. NRG's free cash flow before growth for the quarter was $425 million, a year-over-year increase of $328 million, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted EBITDA. In addition to improved EBITDA, falling gas prices have reduced cash outflows for gas inventory that is typically built in the second quarter. Finally, building on our strong year-to-date results, we are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance for 2023. Now turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on our 2023 allocation, capital allocation. You will notice that the numbers shown on this slide align with the guidance we gave during our June Investor Day presentation. I would call your attention to the progress we have made so far on debt reduction and share repurchases. Through July 31, we have paid down $200 million of debt and remain on track to complete our target of $1.4 billion in debt reduction for 2023. Additionally, we executed $50 million of share repurchases in July as part of our $2.7 billion share repurchase authorization through 2025. Quickly turning to Slide 13. Our credit profile has not changed meaningfully since our last earnings call. As a result, this slide has not substantially changed since our last update, except for an update to the adjustments to capture the noncash fulfillment amortization costs that are included in adjusted EBITDA as a result of the EBITDA harmonization we did last quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 2023 targeted leverage ratio, and we reiterate our commitment to achieving investment-grade credit metrics by the end of 2025. Before turning it back to Mauricio, I wanted to be sure to augment his earlier comments regarding our commitment to enhance disclosure, especially with respect to Vivint. As part of that commitment, you will see in the appendix of the presentation some new disclosure providing key metrics related to Vivint. We will continue to provide these key metrics on a quarterly basis, and we look forward to working with you to help you understand how these metrics drive the financial results of the business. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Mauricio.Mauricio GutierrezThank you, Bruce. Turning to Slide 15, I want to provide a few closing thoughts on our 2023 priority score card. As you can see, our team has remained focused on execution as evidenced by our strong results for the quarter. Our core Energy business is well positioned for the summer. The integration of Vivint is off to a good start, and we're working towards closing the sale of STP by the end of the year. We will remain focused on executing our strategic plan that creates significant shareholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. [Jana], we're now ready to open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorAt this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of BofA.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithMaybe just first off, just -- thank you for all the details on Vivint. Can you talk a little bit about your 6% conversion rate in terms of [rates] here? Just how does that compare versus expectations? And just perhaps provide a little bit of context?Mauricio GutierrezSure. Julien. So --Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithIn conversion of KPIs.Mauricio GutierrezRight. So Julien, in terms of the conversion rates, this is what we've been able to achieve on qualified leads so far. This is higher than what we expected. If you recall, our cross-sell target was around a 3% penetration, so this is above that. Obviously, this is early, but we're very encouraged by the success that we've had so far. This is Smart Home customers buying Energy and Energy buying Smart Home. With the addition of the DIY system that Vivent introduced, we're actually seeing an increase on those conversion rates because it allows us to have an entry point, a cheaper entry point that we can use to up-sell and create more stickiness with the customers. So we're very, very encouraged by what we're seeing so far. At the same time, some of the secondary products like the Protection Plan from Vivint had tremendous success. And that's why when you combine all these with our organic growth, we -- I felt compelled to increase our targets for 2023. So we are seeing results faster than what we expected initially. Very, very encouraging.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithExcellent. And then related, can you talk a little bit about your commitment to building new generation in Texas? I mean, obviously, you want to see this corresponding support from the state here. Just where do we stand on that investment follow through? As well as just the ROFR or any potential commentary around the petition from your coders on STP?Mauricio GutierrezSo let me start with the development projects. As you know, we have 3 development projects that are in late stages of development. I mean, 1 of them is shovel-ready. We have positioned ourselves to capitalize on the market design changes that ERCOT has put forward, both in PCM and the new loan program. As I mentioned, we need more clarity on both of these fronts before we can actually move forward with these projects, but I am very pleased with how the team has positioned these projects, and they're ready. This is exactly the type of generation, exactly the right attributes that we need to manage our loan. This is mid-merit and peaking capacity, so loan following type of attributes. And I'm just very pleased that the team has put us in this position to be able to make that decision. I think your second question was around the claims of our partners at STP. Let me be very clear. We believe that the claims are without merit, and we expect to close the sale of our interest in STP by the end of the year.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. And just to clarify, it says you're not committed yet on making the repowering investments here?Mauricio GutierrezNo, not yet.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAll right. Fair enough. I will leave it there.OperatorOur next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaJust 1 on STP, just a quick follow-up on Julien's question. If -- for instance, if there is a delay and we have to book in this, right? I mean, obviously, there's a level of confidence. We heard the prepared remarks. Could a delay impact anything on the capital allocation slide as we're thinking about it? So even on the buyback side, assuming there could be a delay?Mauricio GutierrezWell, I mean, I'm not going to speculate on that. Like I said, the claims are without merit. Our plan is to close by the end of the year. I think is -- and as we have done in the past, we will deploy capital when we have it, right? So right now, our focus is on the share buyback and the debt reduction program that we have for 2023. As you saw, since we overperformed during the second quarter, we were able to allocate $50 million to share buybacks. If that whole performance continues, we will continue to allocate in capital to share buybacks until we have the -- until we close the sale of STP, which is really an event that will increase substantially the capital that we have available to deploy.Shahriar PourrezaGot it. Okay. Perfect. And then, Mauricio, you guys obviously booked some significant margin expansion this quarter. Could we just dig a little bit further into the $186 million you're calling out? Maybe just both geographically, Texas versus East and/or by function. So does that also include near-term portfolio optimization with trading? Or is it really true longer-term margin expansion? So put it all together, how durable is that?Mauricio GutierrezYes. Let me start, and then I'll pass it over to Bruce for the specifics. I think the team did just a fantastic job in managing margins, both in terms of revenue optimization and also the enhanced supply -- diversified supply strategy that we have on our commercial team, allowed us to realize lower supply cost. So really, really good management all around and our plants performed as expected, which I think that's what we expect going forward. But Bruce, any other additional details?Bruce ChungYes, sure. So when you think about the $186 million, the preponderance of that really came out of Texas, not surprisingly, as you think about year-over-year. With the improved plant performance, that's going to translate into a much better setup for us to be able to service our supply obligations appropriately. Just to give you a little bit of context, as you look at the power price landscape year-over-year between the 2 quarters, you'll see that around-the-clock prices in ERCOT were about 50% lower, which really helped us optimize how we service our load. And then to your point about the question on durability, look. The reality is as long as our plants perform, our margins should be durable, and so that's what we continue to intend to do and continue to plan around. So on the East, there was a little bit of -- there was some margin expansion as well on the C&amp;I side. We have seen C&amp;I customers sign up contracts at better margins for us alongside the optimization activities that Mauricio had referred to. So overall, preponderance of it came from Texas, but some amount in the East as well.Shahriar PourrezaPerfect. Fantastic. I appreciate it. Have a good morning.Mauricio GutierrezThank you, Shar.OperatorOur next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiSo you guys maintained the guidance range, but is it fair to assume that you are tracking above the midpoint, both from the EBITDA and free cash flow perspective?Mauricio GutierrezYes. Angie. So yes, we are keeping -- we're affirming our guidance ranges at this point. I have indicated that we're trending toward the high end of the guidance. Obviously, the third quarter is a very important quarter. We are well positioned for it, our plants are performing well, our supply strategy is working well for us, but we'll have an opportunity to update you on our results in the third quarter call. So far, I am very pleased with how the business has performed across all business segments: Generation, Retail, Smart Home. And -- but third quarter, the summer is very important. Thus you appreciate, given the the extreme weather that we have seen. But so far, the business is performing very well.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. Moving on to the margin expansion on the retail side, and I appreciate that most of it comes from Texas. But we've heard from some other retailers comments about the particular margin expansion for full requirement contracts. Remind us, please, if you actually have any of those? Probably more in the East, but again, just -- I don't even recall.Mauricio GutierrezI mean we have -- remember, the full requirement is really C&amp;I. We share C&amp;I customers across Texas and the East. I think Bruce already mentioned that what we are seeing is higher margins because there is greater volatility in the market, right, both in Texas and in the East. So greater volatility means higher load following premiums, which means higher margins on the customers. This is a trend that we are also seeing in our business, and again, the changes that we made to our diversified supply strategy are working really well both for C&amp;I, but also for residential customers.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And then on Vivint, why is there such a meaningful increase in the acquisition costs for customers?Mauricio GutierrezYes. So I mean, the increase is twofold. Number one, you have higher interest rates. And then number two, the customers are buying more products, and that's a really good thing. Now what you also should be able to see on the KPIs that we're providing you, our revenues are also higher. And by the way, much higher than that increase, so net-net is an increase on profitability. But Rasesh, perhaps you want to just provide a little bit more color?Rasesh PatelYes. Thank you, Mauricio. You said it well. What we're seeing is customers are more engaged in buying more services in the home. I think you can see through the KPIs that the monthly recurring service margin per customer is up 9%, and that's 9% across the entire customer base. When we look at our customer acquisition cohort, it's up more substantively than that, and so you can think of this as the increased acquisition cost will drive over $250 of incremental revenue over the life of the customer. And so we feel very good about the engagement level and the margin expansion in the base.OperatorYour next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraYou've answered all the other questions I had. Just maybe real quick, obviously, you're very confident in 2023 here. So Parish Unit 8, probably you don't see that as a meaningful impact but the in-service is getting pushed. I think the last target was end of July, you moved it slightly to this month. Just can you talk to that, what's going on there?Mauricio GutierrezYes. So I mean we seeing top the unit in middle of July. We are working right now through additional testing, and as you can appreciate, this was basically a rebuild of the entire generator. And -- but I'm confident that we're going to come back end of August. In terms of planning, you're correct. We actually took all the necessary steps to manage our low in the market at really good economics. So I feel that even if Parish comes back at the end of the month, it's not going to have an impact on the guidance that we provided you today.Durgesh ChopraOkay. That's all I had. I appreciate the color.OperatorYour next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroOn the Smart Home business, I was wondering if you could speak to what the free cash flow before growth was for the quarter there? Or any color on the free cash flow conversion you're seeing from EBITDA? Wondering how you're trending versus the full year $140 million pro forma target there?Mauricio GutierrezSure. Bruce?Bruce ChungYes, David. So as you know, we don't report free cash flow before growth for any individual segment of the company. But based on what we are seeing, given the outperformance on the EBITDA side, we would expect to achieve the free cash flow before growth guidance that we had provided in our first quarter earnings call.David Keith ArcaroOkay. Great. And then on the retail side of the -- Retail Energy side of the business, wondering if you could give an update on how customer retention and overall customer additions were trending in the quarter? And curious if you've seen any new entrants start to pop up, particularly in ERCOT? And any kind of change in the competitive landscape there recently?Mauricio GutierrezSure. I'll pass it over to Elizabeth, but I will say that our KPIs on our Retail Energy business are pretty much in line with our expectation, including customer growth. But Elizabeth, can you provide more details?Elizabeth KillingerSure. Thanks, David. We actually saw really strong customer retention rates consistent with last year's performance, consistent with what we expected in the budget. And for customer acquisition, we have a little bit of overperformance for the quarter, and we're really building that momentum to achieve that low single-digit customer growth between year-end 2022 and 2023. As far as competitive landscape, we see a normal, healthy, competitive market in Texas. It's pretty consistent that every year, we'll see a new player add billboards in the market or start doing something different, but there isn't anything materially different. We do see competitors like Shell and others that are larger competitors, which we appreciate because overall, that strengthens the market. But our performance is strong, and our leading digital experience and leading customer acquisition and retention help us win in the marketplace.OperatorOur final question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi.Ryan Michael LevineWhat drove the monthly recurring net service cost per subscriber reduction by 22%? And was that largely in line with what you were anticipating? Or is there any outsized movements this quarter?Bruce ChungYes, Ryan. So the primary drivers of that reduction, about 50% of that really is a function of fewer truck rolls and reduced supply chain constraints. We probably realized about 25% fewer truck rolls than we had in the past. The other 50% or the other 50% of the favorability really results from the ending of our payments to Alarm.com, which had started towards the -- towards the second half of last year.Ryan Michael LevineIs Q2 '23 number more likely to continue on a go-forward basis? Or are there any trends that we should look for as we look into forecast factors?Mauricio GutierrezYes. So Rasesh, why don't you take that one?Rasesh PatelYes, you bet. We feel very good about where net service cost per subscriber is and we would expect the current rate at which we are to continue. The favorability we've seen is durable, and it's a perfect thing when you see customers buying more products and you see higher penetration of your service while simultaneously, you see the cost to serve going down, and that's exactly what's driving the margin expansion. And so we feel really good about the trends, and we think that is sustainable.Ryan Michael LevineSo if I'm hearing you correctly, you continue to see fewer truck rolls and decreasing number of truck rolls on a go-forward basis as a driver? Or am I misinterpreting that?Rasesh PatelThat's right. So you can see, if we think -- when you look at this on a per customer basis, and we would expect to see this lower rate that we have achieved for both contact rate calls as well as truck rolls to continue. We've recently started a virtual technician pilot, which really allows us to serve the customers' needs without ever rolling a truck, and we're seeing very promising results from that. And so this is sort of a new benchmark for the business.OperatorI would now like to turn the call back to Mauricio Gutierrez, President and CEO, for closing remarks.Mauricio GutierrezThank you, [Jana]. And thank you, everyone, for your interest and your time today, and I look forward to speaking with all of you in the days and weeks to come. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.]"

If you want to skip out on our introduction about the utility sector and how it became quite important last year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 2023. The utility industry became one of the most important sectors of the market last year due to the shock of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on global energy markets. The worst hit markets were those in Europe, which had come to rely on large amounts of Russian crude oil and even larger amounts of natural gas. As the war started, and these supplies became risky and contributed to funding the Russian war effort, Europe started to diversify its energy supply chain.The crisis also caused energy and crude oil prices to jump to record high levels in early 2022. While naturally this was a good thing for the oil companies, especially since the petro giants such as TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) made record profits, the reality is a little bit more complex since not all companies were able to earn billions of dollars in revenue from elevated oil prices. Research from economists at the Bank of Italy shows that Russia accounted for 29% of the EU's crude and 43% of its natural gas imports in 2020 - a sizeable reliance that is not easy to break away from.The research shows that when we take a look at two proxies for the financial performance of non-financial European companies part of STOXX Ltd.'s Eurostoxx 600 index, their equity returns drop inversely to their energy intensity while their default risk grows. Energy intensity is the extent that a firm relies on energy for its operations, for example, a large manufacturing company is likely to have a higher energy intensity than a retailing or hospitality company.Narrowing our focus down to the utility industry, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) measured market sentiment in July 2022 when the initial shock of the invasion was at its highest and investors were looking at ways to balance the high interest rate environment with a disruption to the stock market that had hit technology and high growth stocks but boosted the prices of oil companies. Their research, dated November 2022, shows that historically, only 22% of the largest power and utility (P&amp;U) companies had delivered higher shareholder returns than you would expect from a typical S&amp;P 500 company. However, by July 2022, this had grown by more than three times to sit at a whopping 68% - indicating the sudden boost in the fortunes of utility companies was similar to their oil peers as both were bathing in share price growth and higher revenues.Story continuesMoving forward to the current climate, 2023 has seen energy prices stabilize which has also led to a drop in inflation in developed and advanced economies. And naturally, this slowdown in their markets has also impacted the share prices of utility companies. The S&amp;P 500 Utilities index is down by 9.4% year to date and the Dow Jones Utility Average lags this fall by one percent since its year to date performance is negative 8.4%.We've also taken a look at the biggest utility companies in the world to find out that the top three firms as of last year were PJSC Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and China Yangtze Power Co Ltd (SSE:600900). As to the outlook for the rest of this year and what's currently happening in the sector, here's what the management of NextEra had to say during the firm's second quarter of 2023 earnings call:After a period of underlying commodity price inflation, supply chain disruption and trade policy risk premiums, we are finally seeing signs of stability, which will be helpful in our customer conversations. We believe renewables remain economically attractive to alternative forms of generation, and position ourselves to meet long-term customer demand by expanding our significant pipeline of renewable projects. Today, we have a pipeline of roughly 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects in various stages of development. This includes projects in early stage diligence in our current backlog, and is supported by roughly 145 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions. When you combine our significant competitive advantages with our renewable pipeline, we believe Energy Resources is well positioned for growth and our renewable business for years to come.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the worst performing utility stocks in 2023 so far, with the top ones being Via Renewables, Inc.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File)Stocks of many of these banks closed down by more than 1%. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) and the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) both dropped more than 1% as well.Moody’s attributed its decisions to a series of pressures making life more difficult for mid-sized financial institutions across the country, from higher deposit costs and eroding profitability to new capital requirements and a commercial real estate slump.The trigger for many of these issues is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to cool inflation with higher interest rates. Moody's said that campaign ""continues to have a material impact on the US banking system’s funding and its economic capital.""""I don't think that the ratings downgrades suggest that there's more weakness coming that we didn't already see,"" JPMorgan US equity strategist Abby Yoder told Yahoo Finance Live, describing what happened as a ""rearview mirror"" look at the sector.The move downward in many regional bank stocks, she added, had more to do with the fact that many of these stocks had rallied in recent weeks.In fact, many investors pushed stocks higher following a series of second quarter earnings that appeared to ease any lingering fears that mid-sized financial institutions faced the sort of existential threat that surfaced in the spring when the failures of three sizable banks triggered outflows across the banking system.Story continuesDeposits were up at most smaller banks, even those that suffered outflows during the first quarter.But there was one troublesome trend that emerged from those second quarter results. Namely, most regional banks attracted more deposits during the quarter by paying a lot more for them, thus cutting into a key measure of profitability.Many, as a result, revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year, including PNC and Truist.Fifth Third also trimmed its full-year forecast range for net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and what they pay for their deposits.""We're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well, and if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings,"" Fifth Third chief executive Tim Spence said last month.The fresh volatility introduced by Moody's may come in handy for regulators as the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency try to sell a complex overhaul of new capital standards for banks.They argue the changes are needed to make lenders stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for shocks like the crisis of this spring.The new capital proposals are expected to face pushback from the banking industry, which argues that lenders are much more resilient than they were during the 2008-09 financial crisis and that higher requirements could restrict lending.Many midsize banks that could be part of these new rules are already making adjustments by holding back on any increases in dividends or share buybacks. Several also are selling assets to reduce the risks on their balance sheets or examining a pullback in certain types of lending.Banks are ""doing the right things,"" Yoder, the JPMorgan equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live, citing the restructuring of balance sheets ahead of new regulatory requirements.Banks will probably be less profitable, but in the long term, she added, ""they will be in better shape.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Revenue guidance now at around $93 billion this year. That is down from a prior forecast of roughly $97 billion. Much of the hit being put down to the impact of labor negotiations.The UPS and the Teamsters Union reached a tentative deal on a new contract at the end of July. Union members are yet to approve it, however. These results won't come as a huge shock to investors. At the end of April, UPS warned that volume would remain under pressure due to current macro conditions.Moody's has cut its rating on 10 small and mid-sized US banks and warned it could downgrade bigger lenders as well. There were official downgrades for the likes of M&amp;T Bank, Pinnacle, Webster Financial. 11 banks in total were put on a negative outlook including larger lenders like PNC, Capital One and, Citizen's. Those are all falling in premarket trading. Bigger plays like Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp, and State Street are all under review for a potential downgrade.And the good times keep rolling for Eli Lilly. Thanks to a strong drug pipeline, the pharma company upping its full-year guidance after second quarter profit rocketed 85% from a year ago. It now sees full-year revenue landing between $33.4 billion and $33.9 billion, much of the tailwind coming from its type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro which, of course, is also being used off-label for weight reduction and breast cancer pill Verzenio.

Now I'll turn the call over to Donnie.Donnie King: Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we review the results, I'd like to start out by discussing my vision for Tyson and the decisive actions that we're taking to successfully navigate the current market environment. We remain fully committed to our vision of delivering sustainable top-line growth and margin improvement over the long run. With our leadership team, we're executing a multi-point plan focused on efficiency and modernization, including taking a much closer look at our cost structure across the business to drive operational excellence. We are already seeing tangible benefits of our efforts. We've been through market cycles before and I'm confident that we have the right strategy, seasoned leadership and team members in place to emerge stronger from this one.We're making good progress and saw sequential improvements in our results in Q3. We're not yet where we need to be, so we continue to focus on what we can control. Earlier today, we announced our intention to close four more of our chicken facilities demonstrating our commitment to taking bold actions to improve performance. Beyond these important actions, I remain optimistic about our future. We are a leader in our industry and we continue to innovate and take market share in most of our categories. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy, and we are leaving no stone unturned to maximize value for shareholders. Diving into our results, we continue to compare against strong performance across our segments last year. However, I am encouraged by the sequential improvements we made in Q3.Let me start with Chicken. Market conditions in Chicken are still challenged with commodity prices across most cuts remaining significantly lower, compared to last year. However, adjusted operating income improved by more than a $100 million of one choice without any material benefits as market tailwinds, these sequential increase was primarily due to internal actions we took. For example, in our fiscal Q2, we decided to close two of our plants convert two others to boneless and rationalized our SKUs, inventory, and other assets. In Q3, the team made significant improvements in yield, spend and efficiency, leading to strong improvement in profitability in just one quarter. As we become more productive with automation and team member engagement, we can further optimize our footprint and reallocate resources to more efficient plants, while still having ample capacity to service and grow with our customers.This enabled us to announce today that we plan to close four additional chicken facilities bringing the total announced closures to six this year. We also recently made the decision to transition away from the “no antibiotics ever” for Tyson branded chicken to a no antibiotics ever important for human medicine approach. Data suggests the use of ionophores can lead to more uniform birds with consistent weight. In turn, we can more accurately forecast supply and demand helping to meet the needs of our customers and consumers. And I want to emphasize that we will continue to evaluate all options including more actions like these across all of our businesses. And beef, we perform better than expected. Our results were driven by our disciplined approach to balancing supply with customer demands, while taking the advantage of seasonal increases in cutout values.However, the beef industry will likely continue facing headwinds. As you may have seen in the latest USDA cattle inventory report, herd liquidation continues to tighten supply, leading to higher cattle cost, narrowing spreads and difficult export market conditions. Pork remains under pressure across the industry and we continue to see headwinds there with both our internal live production and our external sourced hog supply, increased feed costs and low cut out Stroh spread compression through our results. We also had incremental negative impacts in Q3 from a fire at one of our processing facilities. Finally, to Prepared Foods, which is a key growth pillar for the future. The business performed well in Q3. In Retail, our core business lines saw strong volume growth in the quarter and continue to gain pound and dollar share.In Broadline Foodservice, Tyson Focus 6 continues to outpace the industry in volume growth. This led to better than anticipated margins in Prepared Foods. In short, our results this quarter demonstrates that Chicken is gaining momentum and our branded Foods business remains an area of strength. Let me add some further color on the performance of our branded business versus our top peers. As I mentioned earlier, our Tyson core business lines, including the iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park continue to outpace total food and beverage, and our peers in volume growth up 5% versus a year ago. We believe this points to the strength of our core brands and sets us up well for the future. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories, in which we compete, delivering both dollar and pound share growth in the aggregate and across day parts.Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farms and Ballpark, all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin. Our share performance and brand strength demonstrates the momentum we've gained with consumers and they will continue to spend on brands they know and trust. Likewise, we will continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands. While we are pleased with our brand strength and share performance, we're constantly building new innovations to expand the appeal and market opportunities for our products. Over the past few years, our innovations have generated roughly $2 billion in annual sales. Let me highlight a few products we've launched this fiscal year that I'm most excited about.Earlier this year, we announced that Tyson Original Chicken Breast Sandwich for retail channels, which won the People Magazine Food Award for Best Frozen Sandwich. Furthermore, we were excited to see that more than 70% of the buyers were new to the Tyson brand and more than 20% were new to the category. We also launched Tyson Chicken Sandwiches in Food Service space where our sandwiches won awards from Food and Beverage Industry, National Agri-Marketing Association, and National Association of Convenience Stores. As you can see, our innovation in chicken is able to be deployed across channels and occasions highlighting the power of our scale. Moving to Jimmy Dean, which is already a clear leader in the breakfast meal occasion, we're expanding with differentiated capability-based innovation by launching handheld breakfast items.Chicken, fast foodbrian-chan-NbXjZomyNEM-unsplashFor instance, this year, we launched the Jimmy Dean biscuit roll-ups in Food Service channel and Maple Grill Cakes and Toaster Pop-Ups in retail. We're seeing strong customer adoption of these products and promising early consumer demand. In Hillshire Farm, one area of focus in retail has been the trend towards healthy snacking. For instance, we launched Hillshire Farms Snack Kids with 100% real premium meats, cheeses and crackers, all ready to eat on the go. If you haven’t already, I encourage you to try our Snack Kids like Oven-Roasted Turkey Breast, Cheddar Cheese and Wheat Crackers. We launched these products at attractive price points and have already seen strong acceptance with major retail customers. In the food service channel, we are now participating in the fast-growing Cupping Pepperoni category with our very own Hillshire branded Cupping Pepperoni product.We are always on the lookout for how to keep our brands on trend across channels. Now, I'll turn things over to John to review our financial results for the quarter in more detail.John Tyson: Thank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results and then review our individual segments. Our sales were down 2.6% year-over-year, driven by pork and chicken where we saw a reduction in price per pound. More than 90% of the decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in our Beef and Chicken segments. Higher input cost per pound was primarily due to the increase in cattle costs along with unfavorable derivative impacts and higher labor costs. But these were partially offset by lower hog costs, reduced outside purchase of meat in our Chicken segment and lower raw material costs in Prepared Foods. While profit was down substantially versus last year, it's important to note that it improved meaningfully versus last quarter and adjusted EPS increased $0.19 on a sequential basis.Challenges remain, but we continue to improve efficiencies by controlling what we can and believe we're heading in the right direction. Now, on to the individual segments results, starting with Beef. In Beef, revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with lower head throughput offset by higher pricing. Operating profit was down primarily reflecting higher cattle costs, which increased $610 million on a lines per pound basis. Operating margin of 1.6% was down from the historically strong, margins of more than 10% in Q3 last year. On a sequential basis, disciplined yield and procurement benefits along with seasonal cutout improvement help drive better than expected operating profits. Beef is likely to continue to face headwinds and we don't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until herd rebuilding is well underway.Now moving to Pork, revenue was down 18% driven, primarily by lower pricing due to software demand. The operating loss at the quarter was $70 million as spread compression continued to pressure our margins. This was exacerbated by market pressures in our live operations, lower exports and the operational impact of a fire at our Madison facility. Moving on to Chicken now. Sales declined 3.5% year-on-year, driven by lower pricing, partially offset by volume growth. The decrease in pricing reflects the challenging commodity market. While volume grew modestly versus last year, it decreased more than 4% on a sequential basis. This sequential decline is more than historical seasonality reflecting steps we took to allow an internal production to consumer demand, while also reducing finished goods inventory by $70 million.Year-over-year profitability was negatively impacted by market conditions and higher feed cost and a $65 million net derivative loss in the current quarter, compared to a $23 million loss in the prior year period. On a sequential basis, it's worth noting the AOI improved by more than a $100 million. In Prepared Foods, sales declined 2.6% driven by both volume and price. The volume decline was driven by Food Service, as the trajectory of this channel’s recovery remains a little uneven. As Donnie mentioned, our Focus 6 categories are outpacing broad line industry and maintaining their share. Our lower foodservice volumes were partially offset by continued growth in retail, highlighting the strength of our brands. Lower pricing was primarily driven by lower bacon prices, reflecting the underlying cutout values for bellies.Compared to the prior year period, operating profit was up $34 million due to lower raw material cost and productivity gains, which was partially offset by lower sales, higher packaging cost and increased mass investments. Despite increased spending and brand building efforts, we were pleased with our operating margin of 9.2%, particularly so given the challenging retail food environment. Our Prepare Food segment remains key to our strategy providing a high margin, stable business with many growth opportunities ahead helping to offset the pressures and volatility in commodity prices. Before moving on to balance sheet items, I want to provide some context on the goodwill impairment charge that impacted our reported numbers on a GAAP basis, the details of which will be provided in our 10-Q when we file it later this week.The interim impairment testing we did this quarter resulted in non-cash charges in the reporting units that we have been disclosing is at risk in our filings going back to last fiscal year. The impacts of the charges are not shown in our presentation this morning as they are not reflected in our adjusted results, but all reconciliations to reported results can be found at the appendix. Now, to our financial position and capital priorities, we’re building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. Q3 operating cash flow is $660 million, in line with expectations with prudent working capital management, partially offsetting lower profitability. Inventory reduction was the primary driver of improved core working capital.We still see some opportunity to improve inventory days and drive better cash flow. Year-to-date CapEx is roughly $1.6 billion and we continue to moderate our pace of spending. Based on this pace, we don't expect CapEx to exceed $2.1 billion below our prior guidance of $2.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion of liquidity and net leverage of 3.2 x. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged, as we are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and targeting net leverage of at or below 2 x net debt to EBITDA for the long term. During Q3, we returned $167 million to shareholders via dividends and $11 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.Now, let's review our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. We're maintaining our total company sales guidance range of $53 billion to $54 billion and we expect to be at the lower end with roughly flat sales growth for the year. Turning to AOI, in beef, based on our year-to-date results, offset by anticipated live cattle cutout spread compression, we expect full year margins to be at the higher end of our range of between a loss of 1$ and a gain of 1%. For Pork, due to ongoing market dynamics impacting our Pork segment, we now expect full year margins to be between a loss of 4% and a loss of 2%, but at the higher end of that range. In Chicken, we're gaining momentum, but with our results year-to-date, including net derivative losses, we expect full year margins to be at the lower end of our range, but between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%.Prepared Foods generated strong margins throughout the year with continued investment to support our brands, we expect margins to be at the higher end of the 8% to 10% range for fiscal 2023. And as I mentioned earlier, we're reducing our expectations for CapEx of approximately $2.1 billion. Our expectations for net interest expense and tax rate remained unchanged at around $340 million and 22% respectively. So, in summary, while the current operating environment is difficult in several of our businesses, we are making improvements across our operations and we are optimistic on our long-term growth opportunities. We have great teams across our segments. We've got growing demand for our products and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace.So, now, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&amp;A instructions.Sean Cornett: Thanks John. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall, our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following QA.

V, Mastercard Inc. MA, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. FIS, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2133601/5-financial-transaction-stocks-in-focus-amid-steady-consumer-spendingThe Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from expanding transaction volumes resulting from the widespread adoption of digital means. An advanced digital solutions suite, built on mergers and acquisitions as well as tech investments, equips players to capitalize on a booming digital era. Signs of subsiding inflation might pave the way for increased consumer spending in the days ahead.Recovery in travel is likely to drive cross-border volumes. Companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and Equifax Inc. are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe, facilitating the switching of transactions and permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryA Booming Digital Environment: The pandemic made people aware of the hassle-free and affordable nature of contactless payments. Even after the pandemic receded, the digitization trend showed no sign of slowing down across the globe. A higher Internet penetration rate and increased usage of smartphones contribute to the increased uptake of digital payments.In light of the prevailing scenario, it has become inevitable to build an enhanced contactless payments suite or upgrade the existing ones. For this, financial transaction services players have to often resort to technology investments that might escalate costs for them. However, owing to the long-term benefits that such investments provide, the industry players have come up with diversified contactless payment options such as mobile wallets, biometrics and QR codes.Such initiatives will enable the players to solidify their presence in the global digital payments market, boost their customer base and diversify income streams. To counter the growing number of cybercrimes that are often associated with online payments, industry participants remain equipped with fraud prevention solutions.Steady Rise in Consumer Spending: Improved consumer spending implies greater utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction services players. This, in turn, offers an opportunity for industry players to process higher transaction volumes. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market add to the purchasing power of consumers and subsiding inflationary headwinds boost hopes for continually rising consumer spending in the days ahead.Also, the ease with which e-commerce shopping can be done within the comfort of one’s home is likely to provide an impetus to growth in consumer spending. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in the January-June 2023 period, consumer spending in each of the months has witnessed an uptick sequentially.Improved Cross-Border Volumes: Increased travel, whether for business or recreation, will likely boost cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. With industrial and business activities back on track, the demand for international travel is likely to remain steady in the days ahead. Industry participants often come up with efficient business travel solutions that make flight bookings simpler. The ease of digital payments transcends the barrier between borders. Platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise aid in the seamless processing of digital payments.A Prudent M&amp;A Strategy: In addition to tech investments, a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy often becomes the means for building an efficient digital suite. The strategy also gives an opportunity to financial transaction services players to foray into new markets, expand their foothold in existing ones, broaden partner networks and increase customer base. However, interest rate hikes by the Fed to tame inflation result in higher borrowing costs.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

143,cb6be91f-5acc-32bc-a1ca-70302a2d9bac,MA,2023-08-09,5 Financial Transaction Stocks in Focus Amid Steady Consumer Spending,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-financial-transaction-stocks-focus-140000783.html,1691503200,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'MA', 'GPN', 'V', 'EFX', 'FIS']","[The Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from expanding transaction volumes resulting from the widespread adoption of digital means. An advanced digital solutions suite, built on mergers and acquisitions as well as tech investments, equips players to capitalize on a booming digital era. Signs of subsiding inflation might pave the way for increased consumer spending in the days ahead. Recovery in travel is likely to drive cross-border volumes. Companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. FIS, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.About the Industry The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors. The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe, facilitating the switching of transactions and permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryA Booming Digital Environment: The pandemic made people aware of the hassle-free and affordable nature of contactless payments. Even after the pandemic receded, the digitization trend showed no sign of slowing down across the globe. A higher Internet penetration rate and increased usage of smartphones contribute to the increased uptake of digital payments. In light of the prevailing scenario, it has become inevitable to build an enhanced contactless payments suite or upgrade the existing ones. For this, financial transaction services players have to often resort to technology investments that might escalate costs for them. However, owing to the long-term benefits that such investments provide, the industry players have come up with diversified contactless payment options such as mobile wallets, biometrics and QR codes. Such initiatives will enable the players to solidify their presence in the global digital payments market, boost their customer base and diversify income streams. To counter the growing number of cybercrimes that are often associated with online payments, industry participants remain equipped with fraud prevention solutions.Story continuesSteady Rise in Consumer Spending: Improved consumer spending implies greater utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction services players. This, in turn, offers an opportunity for industry players to process higher transaction volumes. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market add to the purchasing power of consumers and subsiding inflationary headwinds boost hopes for continually rising consumer spending in the days ahead. Also, the ease with which e-commerce shopping can be done within the comfort of one’s home is likely to provide an impetus to growth in consumer spending. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in the January-June 2023 period, consumer spending in each of the months has witnessed an uptick sequentially.Improved Cross-Border Volumes: Increased travel, whether for business or recreation, will likely boost cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. With industrial and business activities back on track, the demand for international travel is likely to remain steady in the days ahead. Industry participants often come up with efficient business travel solutions that make flight bookings simpler. The ease of digital payments transcends the barrier between borders. Platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise aid in the seamless processing of digital payments.A Prudent M&amp;A Strategy: In addition to tech investments, a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy often becomes the means for building an efficient digital suite. The strategy also gives an opportunity to financial transaction services players to foray into new markets, expand their foothold in existing ones, broaden partner networks and increase customer base. However, interest rate hikes by the Fed to tame inflation result in higher borrowing costs.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to GLOBALFOUNDRIES Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Dr. Thomas Caulfield, CEO; David Reeder, CFO; and Niels Anderskouv, Chief Business Officer. A short while ago, we released GF's second quarter financial results, which are available on our website at investors.gf.com along with today's accompanying slide presentation.

We will then open the call for questions with Tom, Dave and Niels. We request that you please limit your questions to one with one follow-up. I'll now turn the call over to Tom for his prepared remarks.Story continuesThomas H. CaulfieldThank you, Sam, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report second quarter results that are at the high end of the guidance we provided in our first quarter update as we continue to deliver consistent financial performance against the backdrop of prolonged macroeconomic and cyclical uncertainty facing our industry. Let me start by providing a brief update on the current business environment. Similar to others in the industry, we believe that semiconductor inventory levels across several end markets are coming down more slowly than previously expected. Certain end markets that we service, such as smart mobile devices, communications infrastructure and data center as well as the lower end of the consumer and home electronics markets are being impacted by a combination of increased inventory levels and lower year-over-year demand.Consistent with the discussion in our first quarter update, we continue to believe that the return to more normalized inventory levels in the consumer-centric end markets is forecast to happen more slowly than previously anticipated and based on our discussions with our customers, will at best occur towards the end of 2023. So we still expect sequential quarter-on-quarter revenue growth throughout 2023. We believe that the rebalancing of demand for these markets will also extend later into the year and will continue to be impacted while the global macroeconomic and consumer demand outlook remain challenged. Now despite these headwinds, we continue to see healthy demand in faster growing end markets such as automotive, industrial IoT, and aerospace and defense. We have announced some exciting partnerships, which I will comment on shortly, and we are working closely with our customers to support these critical important markets. Let me now touch briefly on our results, which Dave will discuss in more detail later in his commentary. Revenue in the second quarter increased sequentially to $1.845 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range. We reported adjusted gross margin of 29.6% in the quarter, which exceeded our guidance range. This better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by the favorable timing of positive manufacturing variance, which is expected to moderate in the second half of 2023. I'm also pleased to report that we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.53, which as well was at the high end of our guidance range.Let me now provide you with a brief update on some of our recent customer and partnership activity. Starting with automotive, we remain highly committed to supporting the transition of the industry from internal combustion engine models to ACE, autonomous, connected, electrified vehicles. In addition, our product portfolio is well placed to support the faster pace of uptake from automotive manufacturers seeking to compete on differentiated driver experiences and features as well as on the electronics architecture to comply with evolving safety and security standards.In smart mobile devices, we continue to drive leadership products to remix our business towards the premium tier handset market, where we've seen greater resilience in demand. We also delivered a comprehensive set of features on our [ASW] platform, our leading RF silicon-on-insulator based product line for front-end module components. Finally, we delivered enhancements to our 28-nanometer High-K/Metal Gate platform, which is purpose built for the image sensing and processing segment, where we continue to see content growth associated with the trend towards more cameras and pixel processing in mobile devices. Meanwhile, in IoT, we continue to innovate our differentiated technologies, focused on enhanced power efficiency and embedded memory for secure intelligent solutions at the edge. We are also proud to have collaborated with Cadence Design Systems to support the development of the industry's first binaural hearing aid systems-on-chip prototype to create the smart hearing aid processor, which will utilize GF's 22FDX platform.In communications infrastructure and data center, our customers have indicated they are working through limitary levels more slowly than anticipated, which we expect will continue well into the second half of the year. As a result, we've been able to remix some of our capacity service demand in more durable and growing segments such as automotive.In June, we also announced a strategic collaboration with Lockheed Martin to advance U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and innovation and to increase the security, reliability and resiliency of domestic supply chains for national security systems. Collaborating with GF will enable Lockheed Martin to more quickly and affordably produce secure solutions that increase the capability and national security of the United States. We are proud to collaborate with Lockheed Martin to address the growing need for a reliable supply of trusted feature-rich semiconductors for mission-critical security systems.Additionally, our 300-millimeter Fab in Malta, New York was recently accredited as a Category 1A Trusted Supplier by the U.S. government with the ability to manufacture secure semiconductors for a range of critical aerospace and defense applications. This week also marks the 1-year anniversary of the signing of the CHIPS Act, and our collaboration with Lockheed Martin directly supports the Act's objectives of increasing traceability, provenance and onshore production of critical semiconductor technologies to strengthen national and economic security and domestic supply chains.To summarize, I am pleased to report financial performance at the upper end of our guidance range as our dedicated teams around the world continue to execute on the targets that we set out to deliver for our customers and all our stakeholders. With that, over to you, Dave.David W. ReederThank you, Tom, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. For the remainder of the call, including guidance, I will reference adjusted metrics, which exclude stock-based compensation and restructuring charges. As Tom noted, our second quarter results were at the upper end of the guidance range we provided in our last quarterly update. Second quarter revenue grew sequentially to approximately $1.845 billion, a decrease of 7% year-over-year. We shipped approximately 573,000 300-millimeter equivalent wafers in the quarter, a 9% decrease from the prior year period. ASP, where average selling price per wafer declined approximately 1% year-over-year, mainly driven by the changes in the product mix shipped during the quarter. Our LTAs, or long-term customer agreements, are helping to provide us with greater visibility on pricing dynamics, and we believe that ASPs for the full year will be flat to slightly up compared to 2022. Wafer revenue from our end markets accounted for approximately 89% of total revenue. Non-wafer revenue, which includes revenue from reticles, nonrecurring engineering, expedite fees and other items accounted for approximately 11% of total revenue for the second quarter. Let me now provide an update on our revenues by end markets. Smart mobile devices represented approximately 42% of the quarter's total revenue. Second quarter revenue increased approximately 13% sequentially, but declined roughly 19% from the prior year period principally driven by reduced volumes in the low to mid-tier smartphone segments and a continuation of the well-publicized inventory correction within the broader smart mobile market. Despite these reduced volumes, ASP and mix was flat year-over-year, which can be partially attributed to the framework and pricing certainty provided under our LTAs. During the second quarter, shipment volumes increased sequentially, which was primarily due to increased demand for our RF transceiver stand-alone and SoC solutions into premium tier handsets. Based on the conversations with our customers, we believe that inventory levels across smart mobile devices will remain elevated going into the third quarter as the rate and pace of demand growth is slower than previously anticipated. In the second quarter, revenue for the home and industrial IoT markets represented approximately 19% of the quarter's total revenue. Second quarter revenue increased approximately 4% sequentially and 3% from the year prior period. Year-over-year growth in this end market was primarily driven by improvements in ASP and mix, which helped to offset a modest decline in volumes stemming from the consumer-centric portion of home IoT.The demand for our smart card technology has continued to grow as applications expand beyond digital payments and into areas such as transportation, government, health, security and access control. As Tom noted in his prepared remarks, aerospace and defense is a segment of growing importance within IoT, where we continue to grow design wins and establish new partnerships to deliver best-in-class semiconductor manufacturing security and traceability. As a result, we expect increasing customer demand for our next-generation analog and mixed signal technologies into these end markets to largely offset the midterm inventory correction and market softness and the more consumer-centric portions of the IoT market. Automotive continues to be a strong growth segment for us and represented approximately 13% of the quarter's total revenue. Second quarter revenue increased approximately 36% sequentially and roughly 199% from the year prior period, driven by healthy growth in volumes, ASP and mix as we have continued to ramp production across automotive processing, sensing, vehicle infrastructure and safety applications.The designs we won several years ago are now ramping into production and the success of these products across automotive applications, along with our customers' focus on supply chain assurance, has allowed us to invest in significant capacity. As we continue to allocate more capacity to support the continued growth of silicon content across the vehicle architecture, our automotive business is on track to deliver approximately $1 billion of revenue in 2023, consistent with what we communicated at the start of this year.Next, moving on to our communications infrastructure and data center end market, which represented approximately 12% of the quarter's total revenue. Second quarter revenue declined approximately 40% sequentially and roughly 38% year-over-year as a result of declining volumes, principally driven by the prolonged levels of data center inventory and demand softening for enterprise wired infrastructure. We expect to see a decline in revenues for this end market through the second half of 2023. And as mentioned by Tom, we will continue to allocate manufacturing capacity into more durable and accretive markets, such as automotive. Finally, our personal computing end market represented approximately 3% of the quarter's total revenue. Second quarter revenue increased approximately 44% sequentially, but declined roughly 45% year-over-year, principally driven by declining volume in this segment. We expect this end market to remain at approximately 3% of total 2023 revenue. Moving next to gross profit. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted gross profit of $546 million which was at the high end of our guided range and translates into approximately 29.6% adjusted gross margin. As Tom alluded to, the 160 basis points year-over-year improvement was slightly above the guidance range indicated, which can primarily be attributed to better-than-forecast manufacturing cost and utilization benefits within the second quarter. We expect the benefit of these items to moderate in the second half of 2023 and have guided our third quarter accordingly.Operating expenses for the second quarter represented approximately 11% of total revenue. R&amp;D for the quarter declined sequentially to $100 million and SG&amp;A increased sequentially to $108 million. Total operating expenses were $208 million, and we continue to prudently manage our costs. We delivered operating profit of $338 million for the quarter, which translates into an approximately 18% adjusted operating margin, roughly 70 bps better than the year ago period and above the high end of our guided range. Second quarter net interest and other expense was $10 million, and we incurred a tax expense of $31 million in the quarter. We delivered second quarter adjusted net income of approximately $297 million a decrease of approximately $20 million from the year ago period. As a result, we reported adjusted diluted earnings of $0.53 per share for the second quarter. Let me now provide some key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $546 million, CapEx for the quarter was $400 million or roughly 22% of revenue. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets as set out on the statement of cash flows, was $146 million. At the end of the second quarter, our combined total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities stood at approximately $3.303 billion. We also have a $1 billion revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. Next, let me provide you with our outlook for the third quarter. We expect total GF revenue to be between $1.825 billion and $1.87 billion. Of this, we expect non-wafer revenue to be approximately 11% of total revenue. We expect adjusted gross profit to be between $502 million and $542 million. We expect adjusted operating profit to be between $277 million and $327 million. Excluding share-based compensation for the third quarter, we expect total OpEx to be between $215 million and $225 million. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect share-based compensation to be approximately $45 million, of which roughly $16 million is related to cost of goods sold and approximately $29 million is related to OpEx. We expect net interest and other expense for the quarter to be between $7 million and $13 million and tax expense to be between $10 million and $18 million. We expect adjusted net income to be between $254 million and $302 million on a fully diluted share count of approximately 556 million shares. We expect adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter to be between $0.46 and $0.54. As previously communicated during our May earnings call, we anticipated that utilization would run in the mid-80s for 2023. Included in our third quarter guidance is the expectation that utilization will be in the low to mid-80s for the full year 2023 as the well-publicized inventory correction flows through the supply chain. For the full year 2023, we now expect CapEx to be approximately $2 billion, which is a reduction from the guidance of $2.25 billion provided in our first quarter update. We anticipate that this CapEx profile will step down sequentially through the second half of the year. In summary, consistent operational performance from our 13,000 employees and continued efforts to expand our differentiated product offerings in key growth segments enabled us to achieve second quarter results at the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in our first quarter earnings update. Although we are not immune to the cyclical headwinds currently impacting the broader semiconductor industry, we are implementing initiatives to mitigate the impacts on our business, and we remain deeply focused on positioning GF for future growth opportunities. With that, let's open the call for Q&amp;A. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.Ross Clark SeymoreOne near-term question and one longer-term question for my follow-up. On the near-term side of things, Tom and David, you talked about -- in the last quarter about the total year revenues being down mid- to high single digits. So I wondered if there's any update on that. And perhaps more importantly, how are the LTSAs holding in? And if the inventory has to be burned, what are you guys getting in return for lowering the unit side of the equation per the LTSA agreements?David W. ReederRoss, I think I'll start with that question and then maybe, Tom, I'll pass it over to you to build on it with respect to the LTAs. Ross, in our prior earnings calls, we forecast that first quarter revenue in 2023, we believe would be our trough and then that quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter that we expected to grow from there sequentially. So we still expect that sequential profile.And as you mentioned, for the full year, we forecast that we expected revenue to decline in the mid- to high single digits. We still expect to be in that range. And with our first half results really now in the books and with our third quarter guidance, you can probably infer from that third quarter with the first half that we are expecting to be towards the high end of that year-over-year range.Tom, do you want to take the LTA question?Thomas H. CaulfieldYes, very good. Look, the premise of the LTAs was to create better balance through a down cycle. It wasn't just to have one side wins and the other side losses, it was to create balance and work through this trough. And I think you see it in our performance quarter-on-quarter, both in revenue and profitability that we've been able to manage inventory and manage underutilization fees in a very pragmatic way with our customers to get through this in partnership. And I dare to imagine what our world would look like if we didn't have those partnership agreements in place in the downturn with this.David W. ReederRoss, did you have a follow-up?Ross Clark SeymoreYes, I did. This morning, we also had an announcement on the competitive front, TSMC doing a JV with a handful of European either actual or potential customers for GF. Just wondered what your view on that. I can see the positive side is endorsed geographic diversification of manufacturing and the strength the end markets, et cetera. On the negative side, obviously, those are customers you guys would want. And so more competition in those regions, I could see lending some pressure to you guys. So how do you view that announcement from competing foundry?Thomas H. CaulfieldWell, we didn't wake up this morning and just see that happening. This has been in the press, in the news for a long time. I think you hit on one of the points, but let me comment on 3 elements of this. Building this capacity is consistent with the supply of the world we need in the next decade. This is an industry that's going to double. In fact, German automotive associations have talked about the need for 27 fabs alone in Europe to build capacity. TSMC is not -- GF is not going to go create this capacity and its own. TSMC needs to participate in a meaningful way as well. Yes, those are our customers, but they're also TSMC's customers. No one has a monopoly on any given customer, right? We -- these customers source for many of us on different platforms for different needs. I'd also add to that, that, to your point, is in the past, this industry is built on driving huge economies of scale by concentrating supply in one region, and it drove the ultimate in cost capability because of that economies of scale. But it created an unintended consequence of huge issues with supply chain resiliency. And so GF in 2009, when we were launched, we were there to create -- to begin that thesis of the world needed a more diverse geographic manufacturing capacity for semiconductors.We could all argue maybe that was a little bit ahead of its time. But today, it looks like it was a pretty good thought back then. And so what you're seeing is not only our competitors adding capacity that the world needs over the next decade, but they're putting it in a broader footprint to respond to the fact that we need resiliency and supply chain to your point. But the third thing is greenfield and being able to build in a high degree of concentration in one region and now taking that show on the road as it were to build another locations doesn't come very easy. It's very difficult to get the economies of scale to get the cost. And we see this is putting pressure on cost structures for others that are trying to build a geographically diverse footprint. And that just creates for GF, a better pricing environment going forward. So that's how we feel about it. This is not something that -- this isn't the first and last of something like this. The world, if we really believe, needs that kind of capacity. TSMC will need to do their part, not just you have to do own part. I hope that helps, Ross.Operator(Operator Instructions) This question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.Mark John LipacisComing back to the LTAs, I believe last quarter, you noted that you had 5 new LTAs and some of your customers are actually asking for increase in scope. And so I guess I'm wondering, are we -- can you give us an update on that pace? Are we kind of at the point where your customers are kind of putting a pause on signing up for new LTAs or are you still seeing that kind of extension of longer-term agreements from your customers?Thomas H. CaulfieldNo, great question. There's no pause going on. We are in active discussions with a number of customers. Timing is everything. And sometimes for more substantial ones takes a little bit more time for these things that come in place. Again, this comes back to my earlier commentary. It depends what you believe, if you think the industry is done and you have all the capacity you want, then you're not going to look forward, and you stay pat. There are plenty of our customers that see their growth opportunity in automotive, IoT and things of that nature, where they want to make sure they're booking today that certainty of supply for when this industry begins to grow again. And we're working with them in very serious discussions that will eventually come to a close. So LTAs are in our past, and they are certainly in our future. And I think this is the new norm for our industry. David, anything you'd add to that?David W. ReederYes, I can just build on that briefly. You're right, Mark, we didn't announce that we had signed any new material LTAs this quarter, but we are quite pleased with some of the partnerships that we've announced and that we've developed Lockheed Martin being one of those aerospace and defense being a key market in market for us on a go-forward basis and being a market along with industrial and home and industrial IoT that's performing quite well. We're also very pleased with the progression of our LTA funnel where we have ample opportunities, some of which are quite mature. So stay tuned for more LTAs in the future.Thomas H. CaulfieldGreat. Do you have a follow-up?Mark John LipacisYes, please. On the gross margin side, I don't think I fully understood the timing of the variances and how they will moderate going forward. I guess I assume that if you get some progress on your gross margins, you kind of get to keep them. So if you could just provide a little bit more color there, what kind of variances are we talking about? And from the standpoint of timing, where these variances you were expecting to hit in the next quarter, if you just give a little more color on that, that would be helpful.David W. ReederCan do, Mark. Let me give you some kind of specific second quarter commentary, and then maybe I'll broaden it out a bit as well. And as we mentioned in our prepared commentary, we did benefit a little in the second quarter from some better than expected, quite frankly, unforecasted manufacturing variance. So what is manufacturing variance. It could be anything from reduced input cost. It could be higher utilization. It could be better cost absorption. It could be better pricing that you receive from suppliers. Those would all kind of broadly fall under the category of manufacturing variance, and we received some better-than-expected manufacturing variance in the second quarter.So in the absence of that benefit, we would have been at the high end of our second quarter guidance range. So we don't really expect that manufacturing variance to kind of continue throughout the second half of this year, and so we reflected that in our guidance accordingly.But purely from a guidance perspective, when we think about third quarter -- to give third quarter gross margin, to give you some context, our midpoint guidance for third quarter and our upper range for the third quarter is actually higher than what we guided in second quarter. So if you just think about it from a purely guidance perspective, second quarter guidance versus third quarter, we're actually guiding you up guidance to guidance in the third quarter.And then if I could just touch briefly on our longer-term gross margin road map, which I know you remember well from both pre-IPO as well as Capital Markets Day. If you recall from those roadshows and from that Capital Markets Day, we put together a pretty specific model and a bridge to go from where we were at the time to our long-term gross margin model of 40%.And from a gross margin perspective, barring the current utilization headwinds that we're seeing today, we're actually ahead of that model. We're at about mid-80s in terms of utilization, which, as you know, from a sensitivity perspective, 5 points of utilization is roughly 2 points of gross margin. And yet we've been able to actually not only sustain gross margin, but slightly grow it on a year-over-year basis.So with respect to our long-term gross margin road map still on track, barring the underutilization actually ahead of schedule, but certainly on track to that long-term gross margin commitment that we had made.OperatorThis question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi.Christopher Brett DanelyJust another couple of questions on the gross margins going forward. Have your pricing assumptions changed at all in the last 3 months for 2023/2024? And if we keep the mid-50s utilization rate going forward, is there any risk that your inventory becomes too high because it jumped up sequentially? So wouldn't we have to have some sort of lowering of utilization rate going forward?David W. ReederSure. So let me address a couple of the points there. Let me start with the ASPs. First, let me reiterate that for the full year 2023, we still expect ASPs to be up slightly year-over-year. With respect to the second quarter, obviously, year-over-year ASP was down very slightly. That was really driven by a shift in our product mix as our core pricing has remained mostly contractual and unchanged. The mix shift in our business, it has produced a more accretive adjusted gross margin structure, as you saw with the number that we printed in the second quarter. But on a period basis, that mix shift did produce a slightly lower ASP year-over-year. And the other item I'd like to just talk about briefly before we talk about some of the inventory is that free cash flow. When you look at what we've been able to deliver, both from a gross margin perspective from cash from operations and from a capital efficiency perspective, we were able to deliver $146 million of free cash flow in the quarter. The higher gross margin structure, combined with that operational productivity and capital efficiency enabled us to produce that number despite, as you mentioned, some of the inventory growth that we saw in working capital. On the inventory growth, most of that is related to substrates. We have some agreements with some of our suppliers. And some of those agreements include the purchase of substrates, which we've been able to acquire at some favorable prices. Those substrates are good for many years. And as we look through this current inventory perturbation, we look through this cycle, having the ability in the balance sheet to be able to support acquiring some of -- for what -- what would be for us raw material substrates at some fairly attractive prices, it's a good long-term decision. Did you have a follow-up, Chris?Christopher Brett DanelyYes. Just talk about the 2024 expectations for pricing. Have you guys changed any of the terms of the LTAs for 2024 over the last 3 months?David W. ReederYes. So I won't delve too far deeply into 2024. But with respect to ASPs, look, we still have very good LTA coverage in 2024. And as you know, those contracts are fixed price, fixed volume, fixed duration. About 90% of our design wins are single sourced, and about 2/3 of our revenue today is also single source. So as we look through into '23, '24 and even into '25, we continue to see it's a relatively constructive pricing environment right now. That's our current expectation.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.Joseph Lawrence MooreI wonder if you could touch on some of the comments upfront about the pace of inventory reduction happening more slowly. I guess what's -- I'm not surprised at the characterization that there's still some correction going on, but the idea that's happening more slowly. Can you talk about what's driving that? Are the LTAs, are there situations where people are taking inventory that they might not take if the LTAs weren't there? And then how much of that is just maybe there's a permanently higher level of inventory, given anxiety about supply chain. Just kind of curious what's underlying that comment that you made.David W. ReederSure. So when we think about inventory, and we track it probably along similar lines as you do, Joe, we look at everything from distributor inventory to customer inventory to OEM inventory and then, of course, to GF as well as our peer inventory. So we look at inventory across a broad spectrum. And so when we say that inventory is depleting more slowly than we are expecting, we're primarily referring to inventory broadly across our customer set as well as across the disti and the OEM channels.When we look at that inventory, I think the glass half full view is that, that inventory is no longer growing. It looks like it has troughed, and it looks like the inventory is continuing to deplete now from this point going forward. We did expect that to happen a little earlier in the year, quite frankly, and it looks like it's pushed out. And so now we're no longer growing inventory in those channels that I just mentioned, but they haven't yet materially come down. And so that's pushed things to the right throughout 2023. So we expect that inventory to come down in the second half.Now in terms of why the inventory is currently where it is and what was the driver of it, it really is dependent on end market. I think there are some end markets that structurally will just carry higher inventory levels on a go-forward basis because the cost of that inventory is significantly less than their market opportunity loss. And so I think those markets, and I think the electrification of the automobile being an area where they still are unable to get enough inventory.And then I think when they do get enough inventory, they'll probably run a little bit heavier than perhaps just in time, which was kind of the traditional route. I think in some other markets like handsets, handsets we're expecting to decline on a year-over-year basis, total handsets kind of mid-ish single digits, I think that's a market where perhaps there was a little bit more inventory sold in 2022 than expected. It's carried into 2023. And while there's different areas within that market that are doing better or worse than others, I think that would be an example of the market uptick just taking a little bit longer. Did you have a follow-on, Joe?Joseph Lawrence MooreYes, just on the specific point of the LTAs. Are there -- I mean, it seems like you're working with customers to ensure that they're not taking inventory that they don't want, but like is there any -- are there situations where that causes the inventory position to be a little stickier?Thomas H. CaulfieldI think that -- I'll take that, Dave. I think that's the point. The point is, where do you trade off kind of settling up with an underutilization fee versus taking a little bit more inventory and getting that balance. And that's all part of the muting the amplitude of a cycle like this. You don't want to go down as deep. You want to be more balanced in the peak to trough, but that typically takes the frequency of the time horizon longer. And I don't think anybody is doing anything reckless in taking a lot of inventory not to pay underutilization fees, but it's one of the levers they have and that collective we make those judgments together.David W. ReederAnd if I could build on that, Tom, let me just maybe talk to a proof point. One of our customers that's in the smart mobile space, actually, when they announced over the last week or so, they actually mentioned GF, they mentioned their LTA with GF. And one of the things that they mentioned was the flexibility that exists within that LTA such that they were able to migrate out of a technology node or a product set that perhaps was not in as much demand to actually a product and add a technology node that was in much more demand where they needed incremental capacity.And so I think that's a great example of the framework, the LTA framework being incredibly productive because instead of fixating on one particular product or one particular variable of the engagement, we were able to sit down, have a discussion, identify areas where there are still market opportunities shift production and capacity to satisfy those for the customer, which ultimately helps them fulfill their LTA obligation in a much more comprehensive and collaborative way.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with BofA Securities.Vivek AryaFor my first one, I just wanted to clarify, could you give us a sense of which our end markets in Q3 could be up or down sequentially? And then as I look into Q4, I think your comments suggest sequential growth into Q4. And again, I'm curious what end markets would drive that given the inventory situation in some of your consumer and comms markets?David W. ReederThanks for the question, Vivek. I think I'll pass this over to Niels to maybe provide some color on 2 of the end markets, in particular, that not only grew in the second quarter, but that we expect to continue to support our enterprise revenue well into the second half both automotive and home and industrial IoT. Niels, do you want to provide some commentary on those end markets.Niels AnderskouvI could go a little bit deeper on maybe starting with automotive and maybe addressing it in 3 ways: First, actuals this year, our expectations for '23, but also maybe talk a little bit about our long-term expectations. So as of today, we're servicing demand from [de wins] that we had over the recent years. You can see from the numbers that we did approximately $425 million in automotive in the first half and get close to $250 million run rate in the second quarter, and we're expecting sequential growth in third quarter. So we talked about in previous calls achieving $1 billion this year, and we feel confident that we will do that in 2023.So in terms of looking at the future and the long-term growth, if you look at the silicon content in automotive, is expected to grow about 6x as you move from ICE to ACE, as Tom mentioned earlier. So probably an ICE about $300 on average to ACE $2,000 to $3,000 in average. So a substantial growth in silicon content. And when you look at that silicon content, what I think is really important to highlight is that the essential chip technologies that we have at GLOBALFOUNDRIES, they're a great fit for this. And I'd like to talk just to mention a few of them because I think the diversity and the broadness that you have of our technologies really talks to this long-term opportunity in a very good way. So some examples could be high-performance millimeter wave for radars or high dynamic range processes for the imaging sensing. Both of these 2 technologies are crucial to get good autonomous performance in the cars as we move forward. Low-power, nonvolatile memories for the MCUs, domain controllers, aggregators. We have a very comprehensive power portfolio that supports both the body control, LED lighting, battery management system, onboard charging, traction inverters. And then lastly, strong CMOS for the networking, [CAN, LIN], video, audio and [cluster] segments of the cars. So really, for us, it looks like a very, very broad future here, and we feel good about where we're going with the technologies longer term. With regards to longer term, we also continue to strengthen our partnership. GM exclusive production capacity that we announced in February '23 is a good example on that. And so really based on these partnerships and the de wins we have, we expect this business to more than double in the second half of this decade. So that will be a little bit of more content around our automotive position.David W. ReederMaybe just to round that out for you, Vivek. I think what you heard was you heard automotive has grown sequentially for us nicely also year-over-year. We're expecting that to continue to get to that kind of $1 billion revenue estimate that we had forecasted for the year. Home and industrial IoT, we're expecting it obviously, on a sequential basis, we're expecting it to continue to perform well. Smart mobile devices, we had some nice growth sequentially from first quarter to second quarter, but we're kind of expecting to kind of bump around this level.As we deplete inventory towards the end of the year, and that's probably a true statement, not only for the third quarter for smart mobile devices, but throughout the year. And then both comms infrastructure and data center and PC, we expect them, obviously, to then fill in the gap to the revenue guidance that we provided for third quarter and the full year. So that's how we think about it.Thomas H. CaulfieldAnd then the one thing we said just I'll pile on, if you don't mind, is aerospace and defense. We see that foundry portion of that market growing by the end of the decade to about $2.5 billion. And there's no reason we shouldn't get our ""fair share or disproportionate share"" in that market. And we intend to go do that. And part of the announcement in 2Q with Lockheed Martin is about going after that. Lockheed Martin announced that they acquired a design team. So now they can make their own ASICs, and they want a foundry partner, so who they select GLOBALFOUNDRIES. So [A&amp;D], a lot like automotive, it's you win sockets, they take many years to ramp in production, but they stick around many years. So a strategic play in A&amp;D feels a lot like our strategic play, we kicked off 3, 4 years ago in automotive to get to a growth engine for us. So stay tuned on that.David W. ReederVivek, did you have a follow-up?Vivek AryaYes, please. On pricing, I think from what I heard, it seems there is somewhat of a positive bias in the second half, and I'm Curious what's driving that. And I think as we look forward, I know you're not giving specific '24 or '25 outlook, but do your LTA suggest the pricing trend to be up, down, flat as we look over the next few years?David W. ReederSure. So we've stated really for a long time that our expectation is that pricing in '23 -- again, I'm talking about the full year 2023, we're expecting pricing to be up slightly from 2022. What you're hearing from us today is that we continue to expect that to occur, and that's our current forecast, and we feel quite good about that. And so kind of some product mix period by period aside, which will always make the decision to move to accretive product mix if it's accretive to gross margin versus purely focusing on ASP. But from a global statement with full year ASP in '23, we expect to be up slightly from 2022. With respect to pricing longer term, I think what you've seen happen is, one, you've seen customers sign a lot of LTAs. And as we've spoken about, those have fixed price, fixed volume, fixed duration. The pricing is very solid. I also think more broadly speaking, that you've seen the industry put on new capacity. And the economic models to support putting on new capacity require the higher ASPs and the ASPs to be quite sticky at those levels. And so that's not only a GF statement, that's kind of an industry statement. And so based on both the LTAs as well as the incremental capacity that's been added, we're expecting ASPs to be quite stable and to be in a pretty conducive environment to have stable ASPs through 2024.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.Harlan L. SurMaybe following up on Vivek's. So on your outlook for full year wafer pricing, you mentioned blended average pricing flat to slightly up. But on a like-for-like, is pricing up better than that? I just want to make sure that the team is maintaining its fairly strong pricing power profile.David W. ReederSure. Let me perhaps be a little bit more specific. And it depends on the period that you're looking at when you look back into 2022. And as we've spoken about before, and I know you know, Harlan, we put on a pretty fair amount of capacity in 2022. And with that incremental capacity came the ramp of specific LTAs and those LTAs ramped at higher prices.And so when you really look at the pricing for the second half of '22 versus the pricing in '23, that pricing is relatively flat year-over-year. But when you look at the pricing in the first half of 2022 versus 2023, that pricing, particularly in the first quarter, was significantly lower. And so the ramp of pricing was really tied with the capacity and the ramp of the LTAs.And so the short answer to your question is, on a like-for-like basis, as those LTAs kicked in, pricing is very flat. I think on a year-over-year basis, from a full year blended effect, you're going to see a slight increase in full year ASP in '22 versus '23. Hopefully, that answered the question. Did you have a follow-on?Harlan L. SurYes, it did. So your large secure smart card access business and RFID tagging business, right, that appears to be holding up relatively strong here through second half of the year. And I think you and your large customer are now able to sort of redirect their wafer starts to support the backlog of demand that I think was unmet in this segment over the prior 3 years. I assume other of your customers are able to redirect their wafer starts to product segments where capacity has been tight until just recently, right? It's a good reflection, I think, of the product diversity of your customers that's helping to sustain their business, your business, auto is another good example. Any other good examples of the product diversity helping to backfill some of the areas where there might be some excess customer inventories?Thomas H. CaulfieldYes. So I think that's a really good point. I'll take this one, David. So 2 pieces. One, you talked about a particular end market, smart cards. Well, if you think about smart cards, it's more than just your credit card when you wave it past a machine -- point of sales for transaction, touchless, it's not health -- it's health care. It's government security. It's credentials for your car. So it's a broadening market. But the bigger point you make is really important. It's -- you have to have 2 things. You have to have a diversity of technology platforms, and you have to have capacity that you can fund so that you can move for, hey, I need more 40-nanometer embedded memory versus a 55 solution because this customer wants to buy here. We've worked hard and long on creating that Fungibility within fabs and across our global network. And that allows us to respond to the some of the lumpiness in these market segments to some customer moving of their products as they see opportunities. And so you need both the platforms that you can address these markets and you need the fungible capacity. And that's something we'll continue to invest in across our 300- and 200-millimeter Fab network.David W. ReederAnd Harlan, to give you some proof points that you're looking for. Obviously, you mentioned smart card. On the automotive side, we've been able to move some of the comms infrastructure and data center capacity to support more of the automotive business. On the smart mobile device side, we had a customer that actually provided that example for us. I won't mention their name, but you could go back to those notes and look at them mentioning the GF LTA and how they were able to migrate from one product to another. And we have multiple other examples where we've been able to utilize that flexibility that Tom mentioned to be able to not only quickly move on customer demand, but also do it in a very capital efficient way, which is going to help us accelerate our path to free cash flow in the future.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.Mehdi HosseiniYes. The first one, last earning conference call, you talked about revenues for '23 flat to down high single digit. And I'm not asking for Q4 guide, but unless there is a significant improvement on a sequential basis in December, your '23 revenue would come at the low end. Is that a fair read through of what you reported on your guide for September in the context of the whole year?David W. ReederThat is, Mehdi. So what we reiterated was we still believe we'll be down mid- to high single digits for the year. And given that we've already kind of posted the first half and guided the third quarter that would imply that for the fourth quarter and the full year that we would be at the high end of that year-over-year decline range.Mehdi HosseiniSure. And then with their targeted gross margin of 40%, I just want to better understand if this is a gross or net or in other words, to what extent, it includes all the subsidies. And in that context, if there is any update on the CHIPS Act that would impact to gross margin looking into next year?Thomas H. CaulfieldDave, You take the CapEx. I'll take the CHIPS Act.David W. ReederSure. So when we originally contemplated our long-term gross margin of 40%, what that contemplated was capital intensity of about -- on an ongoing basis, steady-state basis, if you will, of 20%. And so that in other words, D&amp;A would be about 20% of the P&amp;L there. I think what you're hearing from us and potentially from others is that the capital intensity should be slightly offset by some of the various government support around the world. And so we haven't updated our long-term gross margin model, but the assumptions that went into it were 20% capital intensity.Tom, did you want to...Thomas H. CaulfieldAnd part of that -- and 20% is a net number. And so that's why these co-investments or incentives by governments around the world, including the U.S., are important. Remember, just for way of context, there's 2 ways you qualify for incentives is the ITC, which is already in flight, which is $0.25 on the dollar for capital investment in semiconductor. And then the CHIPS billed and beginning of 2022 was the year of creating the need and the program, and 2023 is the year of vetting applicants and beginning the allocation for execution.But look, for us, nothing has changed. It's not about our capital allocation. It's all about how we approach the market with certainty, durability and profitability. We will never put capacity on independent of how many subsidies they are there to help us if we don't have certainty to demand by our customers. And we're not -- this isn't a game of chasing dollars, it's a game about certainty of demand. And when we add that capacity, we want to do it in durable markets, markets that we talked about earlier today that have long view into the future and stability and then of course, profitability. We're not going to invest if we can't get competitive returns on investment. Now bills like the CHIPS Act and ITC help close that economic equation, which helps. But it doesn't -- if there's no demand, there's no reason to leverage all that. So the key here is to get customers lined up to leverage that capacity we could put on for their products for their needs over the longer term and then use government incentives to create that capacity in our global footprint.David W. ReederAnd Mehdi, let me just provide you an additional contextual point related specifically to CHIPS Act, specifically the ITC. So in 2022, in the U.S., we believe that we've got about $450 million of investment that qualifies for the ITC that would imply -- at about 25% rate, that would imply something like about $120 million of potential benefit on that $450 million of qualified investment.And so the way that would flow through the P&amp;L, if you assumed a steady state 10-year depreciation, the $450 million of investment would be [D&amp;A] of about $45 million a year, but you would net out the $120 million benefit. And so instead of being $45 million a year hitting the P&amp;L, you'd get something more like $33 million a year that would hit the P&amp;L. So that would be a real life proof point, both of the benefit from ITC as well as how it would flow through the P&amp;L.Sam FranklinKathy, we'll take one more question.OperatorThis question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.Krish SankarI have 2 of them. Dave, you mentioned about ASPs down 1% in June quarter year-over-year, mainly due to product mix. I'm just wondering how to think about ASP trends within different verticals, like smart mobile, IoT, auto, et cetera, given the fact that we do seem to have a positive bias on ASPs into next year, should the mix shift change into next year? And then I have a follow-up.David W. ReederSure, sure. Look, I think, broadly speaking, ASPs are primarily predicated on how much GF kind of differentiated technology and content is kind of included in the product set or the solution. So you could go literally within any end market, and you could find products that either average you up or average you down with respect to pure ASP. What we really focus on is, we really focus on the product mix that is most accretive to us from a profitability perspective. And while globally, I think you could probably make a statement like on average comms infrastructure and data center, on average, probably has a slightly higher ASP than maybe an end market like automotive.Obviously, you've seen comm infrastructure and data center kind of decline for us given some of the inventory challenges in that particular end market, and you've seen automotive grow in a really meaningful way at globally, probably at slightly lower ASP, but yet you've seen us accrete from a gross margin perspective.And so I think, in general, ASP largely tied to how much total content is in the solution. Does it have nonvolatile memory? Does it have BCD? Is it on an FDX or an SOI-type of wafer? So I think, obviously, that plays an important role, but even more important role is the product accretive miss from a gross margin perspective.Sam FranklinDo you a quick follow-up?Krish SankarYes. I had a quick follow-up. How much of your 2024 capacity is covered by LTAs?David W. ReederYes. So with respect to 2024 capacity, I'll just -- let me provide some brief context. Originally, we committed that we were going to increase our capacity from about 2 million wafers in 2020 to about 2.4 million wafers in '21, about 2.6 million wafers in '22 to about 2.8 million wafers this year to north of 3 million wafers in 2024. We're very much on track to deliver on that plan, although obviously, we've slowed some of the installation of that capacity based on some of the well-known challenges with respect to channel inventory in the market. If you go back to our Capital Markets Day presentation, you'll see how much of that capacity plan was reflected and covered by LTAs. And I would say that we're still largely consistent with what we showed at Capital Markets Day.Sam FranklinAll right. Thanks, Cathy. Appreciate it, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

In fact, the average U.S. physician earns $350,000 a year, with top doctors making ten times that amount, according to a study based on 10 million tax records from 965,000 physicians over 13 years. In their prime earning years (40 to 55), the average physician made $405,000 in 2017, with the top 10 percent earning $1.3 million and the top 1 percent averaging $4 million. Certain specialties, like neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and radiation oncologists, earned even more. In fact, neurosurgeons are considered among the highest-paid doctors in the world. They are also known to be among the highest-paid surgeons in the world. Keep readnig the article to find out where we rank neurosurgeons. Moreover, according to PhysiciansWeekly, the United States was the highest-paying country for doctors in 2021.However, the high salaries stirred controversy among some physicians in the US, who felt it implied that they chose medicine purely for financial benefits. Data also reveals that the United States has a doctor shortage, with fewer physicians per person compared to other economically advanced nations. The shortage resulted from limiting medical school enrollment and residencies, which were cut back in response to a perceived physician surplus in the past.This shortage led to higher incomes for U.S. physicians, who earn about 50 percent more than German physicians and more than twice as much as U.K. physicians. While physician earnings do contribute to healthcare costs, they account for only 8.6% of overall health spending.22 Highest Paid Medical Specialties in the WorldMinerva Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo list the highest-paid medical specialties in the world, we studied a total of 30 high-paying medical specialties in the US.

Earnings were up 46.5% year over year.

Excluding the negative currency impact, sales rose 6.6%. The upside was driven by strategic pricing actions undertaken by management during the quarter, sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma and the acquisition of the U.S. &amp; Canadian Good Start infant formula brand. Unfavorable currency movements partially offset these. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 0.8% year over year.Shares of Perrigo were up 1.3% in pre-market trading on Aug 8, likely due to the better-than-expected earnings results.

At constant-currency (cc) rates, sales were up 12.8% year over year. Organically, sales increased 7.1%.

The strong growth prospects within the Neurosurgery portfolio look encouraging. Upbeat fiscal 2024 guidance buoys optimism on the stock. However, forex woes and stiff rivalry do not bode well for MDT.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has increased 3.1% compared with the industry’s 0.1% fall and a 12.9% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $112.71 billion. Medtronic has an earnings yield of 6.00% against the industry’s yield of -2.37%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 1.57%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsMarket Share Gain Within Cardiovascular to Continue: Investors are optimistic about Medtronic’s strongly expanding global foothold within the company’s Cardiovascular business (consisting of more than 37% of the company’s total revenues in fiscal 2023). Within Cardiovascular, cardiac rhythm management, one of Medtronic’s largest businesses, continued to build on the company’s category leadership. Within cardiac rhythm management, Medtronic’s pacing business continued outperforming the market, banking on strong global growth of its Micra leadless pacemaker family as it enters new geographies and expands in existing markets.In May 2023, Medtronic received FDA approval for Micra AV2 and VR2, which extend the battery life by 40% to a projected 16 and 17 years, respectively. Further, ICDs (Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) within cardiac rhythm management are gaining market share following the latest CE Mark for the Aurora Extravascular ICD. In May, Medtronic released favorable data on the enhanced EV-ICD algorithm and is preparing to launch the Aurora Extravascular ICD in the United States later this year.Neurosurgery Portfolio Shows Strong Growth Prospects: Medtronic’s Neuroscience portfolio, the Cranial, Spinal technologies business has been registering strong growth in recent quarters, raising investors' optimism on the stock. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company's acquisition of Intersect ENT within the Specialty Therapies division in the Neuroscience portfolio contributed positively. Within the Cranial &amp; Spinal business, there has been 5% growth with 6% growth in U.S. Core Spine.Story continuesThe company has launched new spine implants that enhance the overall value of its ecosystem of preoperative planning software, imaging, navigation, and robotic systems as well as powered surgical instruments, all of which are transforming care in spine surgery. These include the ecosystem of Aible-enabling technology and the associated pull-through of Medtronic’s best-in-class spinal implants.Upbeat Guidance: Medtronic’s upbeat fiscal 2024 guidance instils investors' confidence on the stock. The company’s organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 4-4.5%. Per the FX rate as of the beginning of May, fiscal 2024 revenues would be positively affected by approximately $110 million to $210 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2024 worldwide revenues is pegged at $32.30 billion.The full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected in the range of $5.00 to $5.10, including an estimated 6% negative impact from foreign exchange beginning in May. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.18.DownsidesExposure to Currency Movement: With Medtronic recording a significant portion of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a significant dampener over the last few quarters, as in the case of other important MedTech players. During the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, Medtronic noted that fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings would be negatively impacted by approximately 6% from adverse currency translation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCompetitive Landscape: The presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. Medtronic earns the majority of revenues from CRDM, Spinal and Cardio Vascular segments. The company faces intense competition in the CRDM segment from players such as Boston Scientific Corporation. Players such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Stryker Corporation, Zimmer and NuVasive have intensified competition, particularly in the Spinal segment.Estimate TrendMedtronic has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings per share (EPS) has moved from $5.23 to $5.04 in the past 90 days.The consensus estimate for the company’s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $32.16 billion.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts Are Bullish on These 5 Stocks with Increasing Price Targets.Stock futures on August 9 were pointing to an upward trajectory after Tuesday's decline triggered by concerns over the financial system and the economy. Additionally, the Italian government's commitment to imposing a cap on a new windfall tax provided a sense of comfort. The upcoming US inflation report, scheduled for release on Thursday, is taking center stage in the market, reported Bloomberg. The anticipated data is expected to reveal a 3.3% growth in consumer prices in July compared to the previous year. While this marks a slight increase from the previous month, it remains close to the slowest rate seen in the last two years. The yield on the 10-year Treasury notes, an important benchmark, held steady at around 4%. This stability followed a well-received auction of three-year Treasury notes on Tuesday. The auction's lower-than-expected yield signaled stronger demand than initially projected. Meanwhile, China's recent inflation figures demonstrated a 0.3% decline in consumer prices for July compared to the previous year. Although this drop was less severe than expected, it still indicated a move toward deflation.According to Wells Fargo Advisors, investors are urged to exercise patience and adopt a cautious approach to navigating the current market landscape. While the stock market may present opportunities in the coming quarters, it's crucial to emphasize capital preservation given the market's sentiment-driven overextension. Instead of chasing after the technology sectors that have fueled the recent rally, it's prudent to resist the temptation and consider a more measured strategy. Despite projecting a higher year-end target range for the S&amp;P 500 Index, it's important to acknowledge that valuations are currently stretched, making the risk-reward balance less favorable.Story continuesOn the banking side, Moody's recently downgraded credit ratings for many small- and mid-sized U.S. banks and put several major Wall Street names on a negative review, as reported by CNBC. The ratings of 10 banks were lowered, and significant lenders like Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Truist Financial, Cullen/Frost Bankers, and Northern Trust are being considered for potential downgrades. Moody's also shifted its outlook to negative for 11 banks, including Capital One, Citizens Financial, and Fifth Third Bancorp. The reasons behind this are concerns related to interest rates and managing assets and liabilities. This has implications for their available funds and financial strength. Smaller banks like M&amp;T Bank, Pinnacle Financial, BOK Financial, and Webster Financial also experienced official downgrades. Moody's analysts Jill Cetina and Ana Arsov noted that U.S. banks face risks due to interest rates and asset-liability management challenges, affecting their liquidity and capital.On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on tech stocks such as DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC) and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI).

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Upside Potential: 11%On August 8, RBC Capital increased Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) price target from $490 to $580.

The report highlights a notable increase in revenue growth and significant advancements in its pipeline projects. In the second quarter of 2023, earnings per share (EPS) increased by 86% to $1.95 on a reported basis and by 69% to $2.11 on a non-GAAP basis. These numbers include earnings from the sale of rights for Baqsimi ($0.43 EPS) and acquired IPR&amp;D charges ($0.09 EPS).For the full year 2023, the expected EPS has been raised. The reported EPS guidance now predicts a range of $9.20 to $9.40 (increased by $1.02), and the non-GAAP EPS guidance suggests a range of $9.70 to $9.90 (raised by $1.05). This adjustment reflects the company's positive outlook for its financial performance in the coming months.08. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Upside Potential: 13%On August 8, Wells Fargo increased the target price for The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) shares from $250 to $270 per share. They also maintained an Overweight rating on the stock. According to analysts, Yiping Ke, the Executive Director at CMIG Aviation Capital, a leasing company, mentioned in a webinar that deliveries of the 737 MAX aircraft to China are expected to restart later this year. Ke, who directly works with Chinese airlines, indicated that some airlines are getting ready for these deliveries between September and November, as mentioned by the analysts.The analysts also pointed out that while there isn't a single specific event driving this change, Ke highlighted recent interactions between The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) executive VP Stan Deal and the head of China's aviation authority, along with ongoing high-level discussions. The analysts summarized Ke's perspective by saying that it's possible The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) could deliver the remaining approximately 85 737 aircraft already built for China by 2024.07. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Upside Potential: 16%On August 7, DA Davidson's Tom White decided to increase their price projection for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) by 15.7%, marking a shift from the previous target of $140 to a new target of $162. This upward revision in the price target indicates the positive outlook that White holds for the company's performance in the foreseeable future. Notably, White has reaffirmed their endorsement of a Strong Buy rating for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock, suggesting a high level of confidence in its potential. In a comprehensive research commentary, Tom White underlined the robustness of Airbnb's financial performance during the second quarter of 2023. This impressive financial report was officially disclosed on August 3. White's recognition of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) strong Q2 2023 earnings underscores the company's effective execution of its business strategy and its ability to adapt to evolving market conditions.Artisan Developing World Fund had this to say about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included online travel marketplace Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Airbnb outperformed on the resilience of the travel category including for long-term stays, and on operating leverage as cost optimization is met with revenue increases. Notably, our top four holdings entering the quarter (Sea, Meli, Nvidia, Airbnb) which represented 24.37% of capital on December 31, 2022, increased an average of 64.42% during the quarter.”06. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)Upside Potential: 21%On August 8, following an in-line quarter and guidance raise, Bernstein opted to raise its price target for Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) from $568 per share to $599 per share. This upward revision underscores Bernstein's positive reassessment of Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) potential stock value, implying a more favorable outlook for the company's market performance. While increasing the price target, Bernstein maintains its ""Market Perform"" rating, which essentially translates to a ""hold"" recommendation. This suggests that while Bernstein recognizes Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) potential, they don't anticipate significant outperformance compared to the broader market.Notably, the analysts at Bernstein highlight the strong performance of Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) Medicare Advantage, a Medicare program that provides comprehensive coverage beyond the original Medicare. This acknowledgment could indicate that Bernstein sees positive growth potential in this particular area of Humana's business, which might have contributed to their decision to raise the price target.Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“These positive effects were somewhat offset by adverse stock selection in managed health care, where the Fund’s investments in health insurance leaders Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) and Elevance Health, Inc. were a modest drag on performance. Humana and Elevance Health were down during the quarter because of commentary from UnitedHealth Group Incorporated management indicating that medical cost trends were running at the high end of their guidance driven by higher levels of outpatient medical activity, particularly among Medicare patients. We think UnitedHealth, Humana, and Elevance will be able to manage through an uptick in medical cost trends, but we modestly reduced our positions in Humana and Elevance due to the potential impact on earnings.We continue to own UnitedHealth, Humana Inc., and Elevance Health, Inc. because we believe these companies will be able to manage through this period without a material earnings impact, but we did modestly reduce our positions in Humana and Elevance Health.” Click to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts Are Bullish on These 5 Stocks with Increasing Price Targets. Suggested articles:12 Best Places to Retire in Ireland10 Oversold Growth Stocks To Buy11 Jim Cramer Stock Picks this WeekDisclosure: None.

If we don't start that SAF process very soon, we won't reach this ambitious 2050 goal.""(Reporting by Gabriel Araujo; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

167,0fcdcbf7-112e-3001-b69b-90dd9f80f862,BA,2023-08-09,FAA warns of safety hazard from overheating engine housing on Boeing Max jets during anti-icing,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/faa-warns-safety-hazard-overheating-123537080.html,1691498137,STORY,['BA'],"[U.S. regulators are warning airlines to limit the use of an anti-icing system on Boeing 737 Max jets in dry air to avoid overheating engine-housing parts, which could cause them to break away from the plane.The Federal Aviation Administration says the risk to the flying public is serious enough that it will put the order into effect in just 15 days, and without allowing public comment first.The FAA said if the engine inlet gets too hot, parts of the housing could come off and strike a window, causing decompression and a hazard to passengers in window seats.The finding affects LEAP-1B engines used on all versions of the Max. The engines are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran.In 2018, a Southwest Airlines passenger died after part of the engine housing on an older version of Boeing's 737 jet flew off and broke the window next to her seat. That engine failure started with a broken fan blade.The FAA said there have been no reports of the overheating problem occurring on Max flights. It said the potential for damage was discovered during flight testing and analysis in June.Boeing said overheating of the inlets — which are made by Boeing, not CFM — can only happen under “very specific"" conditions and wasn't known until recently.“Boeing has identified measures to mitigate the potential issue and (is) working with our customers to deploy those measures while a permanent fix is developed,” the company said in a statement.The problem highlighted by the FAA involves something called engine anti-ice, in which hot air from the engine is used to heat the housing and prevent the formation of ice that could be sucked into the engines.The FAA is dictating that flight manuals tell pilots and airlines not to use engine anti-ice in dry air for more than five minutes. Otherwise, the FAA said, “during certain combinations of altitude, total air temperature” and engine settings, the engine inlet inner barrel could be heated beyond its design limit. That could cause the inlet barrel to fail and damage a piece of housing called the inlet cowl.Story continuesIf parts break off from engine housing, it could not only break a window but might hit other key parts of the plane, causing pilots to lose control, the FAA said.The FAA indicated it will publish the rule in the Federal Register on Thursday.Two Boeing Max jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. Investigations focused on an automated flight-control system that pushed the nose of the plane down based on faulty sensor readings. Boeing did not tell pilots and airlines about the system until after the first crash.]"

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Southern The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SouthernOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Kimberly Greene, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$69.78 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$68.02. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Southern didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Southern better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Southern Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Southern shares. In total, insiders sold US$5.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Southern Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Southern insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$174m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Southern Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Southern stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To help with this, we've discovered 4 warning signs (2 make us uncomfortable!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Southern.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Kris Sennesael, Chief Financial Officer for Skyworks. Thank you. Please go ahead.Kris Sennesael : Thank you, Lina. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' third fiscal quarter 2023 conference call. With me today is Liam Griffin, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussions will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.Liam Griffin : Thanks, Kris, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team continued to execute well during the third fiscal quarter despite macro headwinds, delivering in line revenue, along with solid profitability and strong cash flow. Specifically, we delivered revenue of $1.071 billion, posted earnings per share of $1.73, and generated $306 million of operating cash flow. During the quarter, we continued to advance our technology roadmap and introduced new high-performance connectivity and analog solutions while supporting product launches at an expanding set of mobile and broad market customers. As a result, we expect double-digit sequential revenue and earnings growth in the September quarter. Turning to our quarterly business highlights.Story continuesIn mobile and IoT, we secured 5G content for Android smartphones across all tiers. We delivered Sky5 platforms for broadband CPEs of leading North American carriers. We supported Wi-Fi 7 launches, our tri-band routers for NETGEAR and TP-Link and Powered Bell's Wi-Fi 6E home gateway. In addition, we continue to gain design win momentum with our 5 gigahertz cognitive wireless audio solutions, supporting Samsung's Q-Symphony soundbars. Across infrastructure and industrial, we enabled 5G small cell deployments with a top North American operator and ramped timing solutions for AI data centers at a leading cloud provider. In automotive, we continue to post double-digit year-over-year revenue growth while capturing design for telematics applications across a broad range of manufacturers.And we extended our engagements by leveraging our power isolation portfolio with a North American EV supplier. These highlights demonstrate Skyworks' technology leadership in mobile, while executing on a diversification strategy in high-growth end markets. Additionally, several disruptive market trends are now unleashing new meaningful growth opportunities for Skyworks. For example, generative AI is proliferating on a global scale with rapid adoption, sparking exponential growth in the amount of data accessed from the network edge to the cloud. In turn, this will further drive complexity in wireless infrastructure networks as AI will require higher throughput, more secure connections, lower latency and improved power management. Skyworks is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends with our advanced integrated solutions, supporting wireless infrastructure, cellular connectivity for mobile devices as well as other leading wireless protocols used in billions of IoT products.With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q4.Semiconductor, Technology, ComponentPhoto by Umberto on UnsplashKris Sennesael : Thanks, Liam. Skyworks' revenue for the third fiscal quarter of 2023 was $1.071 billion, slightly above the midpoint of our outlook. Mobile was approximately 59% of total revenue with broad content gains across our largest customer product portfolio, offset by ongoing weakness in demand from the Android ecosystem as these OEMs continue to reduce inventories. Broad markets were approximately 41% of total revenue. We have another strong contribution from the automotive, infrastructure and industrial markets. Gross profit was $509 million, resulting in a gross margin of 47.5%, in line with expectations. Gross margin was down 370 basis points year-over-year, mostly driven by temporary factory underutilization as we right-size our inventory levels.Operating expenses of $182 million declined 4% sequentially and year-over-year, given our ongoing focus on managing discretionary expenses. We generated $327 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 30.5%. We incurred $8 million of other expense and our effective tax rate was 13.2%, driving net income of $276 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.73, exceeding the guidance that we provided during the last earnings call. Now turning to cash flow. Skyworks' business model continues to deliver very strong cash generation. Third fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $306 million and capital expenditures were $31 million, resulting in free cash flow of $274 million. In fact, for the first three quarters of the fiscal year, we've generated record free cash flow of $1.350 billion and record free cash flow margin of 38%.Also during fiscal Q3, we paid $99 million in dividends and repaid $500 million of our 2023 notes at maturity. Now let's move on to our outlook for Q4 of fiscal 2023. We expect to deliver double-digit sequential revenue and earnings per share growth in the September quarter. Specifically, we anticipate revenue between $1.190 billion and $1.240 billion, at the midpoint of $1.215 billion, revenue for the quarter is expected to increase 13% sequentially. This outlook considers the seasonal impact from major product launches, leveraging our technology leadership, deep customer engagements and world-class in-house manufacturing capabilities. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 47% to 48%, reflecting the cyclical impact of lower factory utilization, while we are reducing our internal inventories.We expect operating expenses in the range of $178 million to $182 million, down 6.5% year-over-year at the midpoint as we continue to optimize operating efficiencies while making the necessary investments in technology and product development to further enhance our leadership position in mobile and drive diversification and growth in our broad markets business. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $8 million in other expense and an effective tax rate of 13.5% to 14%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 160 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range of $1.215 billion, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $2.10, an increase of 21% sequentially. Lastly, given our conviction in Skyworks' long-term strategic outlook and consistent strong cash generation, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.68 per share.And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.Liam Griffin: Thanks, Kris. Skyworks continues to deliver solid financial results despite a challenging macro environment. At the same time, we have further advanced our cutting-edge technologies and product road maps, targeting leading market segments that allow us to both expand and diversify our customer base. In addition, we are well positioned to benefit from powerful market trends, including the electrification and automation of vehicles, the expansion of the Internet of Things, the emergence of augmented and virtual reality and the rise of artificial intelligence, just to name a few. Looking ahead, we expect to capitalize on these opportunities and deliver growth in our highly profitable business with sustainable strong cash generation.

One such stock that has recently piqued interest is VF Corp (NYSE:VFC). Currently priced at $19.06, the stock recorded a single-day loss of 1.75% and a three-month dip of 12.54%. However, according to its Fair Value (GF Value), the stock's fair valuation stands at a promising $66.82.Deciphering the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with VFC. Click here to check it out. VFC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VFCThe GF Value is a unique calculation that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. The GF Value Line, visible on our summary page, provides a snapshot of the stock's fair trade value. This value is determined based on historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow), a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates.Unmasking the Value Trap: A Deep Dive Into VF Corp (VFC)However, a deeper analysis is crucial before making an investment decision. Despite VF's seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors should not be overlooked. These risks are particularly evident in its low Piotroski F-score of 2 and Altman Z-score of 1.38. These indicators suggest that VF, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underscores the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding Piotroski F-Score and Altman Z-ScoreThe Piotroski F-score, developed by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess a company's financial health. The score is based on nine criteria divided into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/source of funds, and operating efficiency. The overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating healthier financials. VF's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Story continuesOn the other hand, the Altman Z-score, invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Overview: VF Corp (NYSE:VFC)VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its portfolio includes renowned brands like Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. VF markets its products in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through wholesale sales to retailers, e-commerce, and branded stores owned by the company and partners. The company has grown through multiple acquisitions and traces its roots to 1899.Unmasking the Value Trap: A Deep Dive Into VF Corp (VFC)Analysis of VF's ProfitabilityDelving deeper into VF's financial health, we observe a decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates 2020: 3.07%; 2021: 7.66%; 2022: 7.45%; 2023: 0.84%. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in VF.Observing VF's financials, it's crucial to note that the cash flow from operations over the trailing twelve months (TTM) stands at $-133.9 million, whereas the net income in the same period is significantly higher at $117.12 million. The Piotroski F-score considers this discrepancy as a potential red flag. The rationale behind this is that a company's operating cash flow is a more direct and less manipulated measure of its cash-generating ability than net income. Net income, while important, is susceptible to accounting treatments and non-cash items which can distort the true cash profitability of the company. If a company consistently shows lower cash flows from operations relative to its net income, it could indicate that the earnings quality is poor and the company might have difficulties sustaining its operations or financing its obligations, a fact which could negatively impact its financial stability and investor confidence.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendAssessing the aspect of leverage, liquidity, and sources of funds, VF demonstrates an alarming rise in its debt-to-total assets ratio over the past three years. The provided data shows 2020: 0.54; 2021: 0.51; 2022: 0.48; 2023: 0.56, expressed as percentages. A higher debt ratio suggests that VF is increasingly financing its assets through debt, thereby escalating its financial risk. The Piotroski F-Score views this as a negative indicator, further cautioning investors about VF.Unmasking the Value Trap: A Deep Dive Into VF Corp (VFC)Examining VF's financial stability, there's a notable decrease in its current ratio over the past three years, as shown by the data 2020: 3.65; 2021: 1.49; 2022: 1.33; 2023: 1.37, which is expressed as percentages. The current ratio is a key indicator of a company's short-term financial health, as it gauges the ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. A declining current ratio suggests that VF's liquidity and capability to manage immediate financial obligations are deteriorating.Operating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, VF follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2020: 54.79%; 2021: 53.47%; 2022: 54.04%; 2023: 52.28%. This contraction in gross margin suggests that VF is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.In terms of operational efficiency, another key indicator, VF has unfortunately reported a declining trend in asset turnover over the past three years, as evidenced by the data: 2020: 0.85; 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82. Asset turnover measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales, and a decrease in this ratio can indicate a drop in efficiency. This could be due to various factors, such as underutilization of assets or a decline in the market demand for the company's products or services. Consequently, this downward trend in asset turnover implies that VF may need to revisit its operational strategies to improve the utilization of its assets and boost its sales volume.While the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for VF, its current score suggests potential troubles.VF's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of VF's Altman Z-score reveals VF's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating VF's historical data, 2020: -0.02; 2021: 0.02; 2022: 0.01; 2023: 0.00, we observe a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. This downward movement indicates VF's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of VF's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2020: 0.03; 2021: 0.08; 2022: 0.11; 2023: 0.02) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that VF might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for VF is its asset turnover. The data: 2020: 0.85; 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 from the past three years suggests a decreasing trend in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in VF's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.Conclusion: VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) - A Potential Value TrapDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, the combination of a low Piotroski F-score and a low Altman Z-score suggests that VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) may be a potential value trap. The company's declining ROA, increasing debt ratio, and decreasing gross margin and asset turnover all signal potential financial distress. Therefore, investors are advised to exercise caution before investing in VF.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Piotroski F-score using the following Screener: Piotroski F-score screener .GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the followingThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Spokespeople for the other companies either declined to comment, or did not respond to requests for comment.Since late 2021, the SEC and CFTC have been probing broker dealers over the record-keeping failures. JPMorgan Chase and Co, Barclays, Bank of America and others have shelled out more than $2 billion in related fines.""The regulators are clearly trying to send a message to Wall Street with the scale of the fines,"" said Christine Lombardo, a partner with Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius law firm. ""I do not think it's going away. Part of the problem is that this is a truly hard issue for firms to navigate.""Story continuesWhile it is standard practice at most banks to maintain records of employees' email communications, firms have struggled to get employees to reliably use approved channels for more spontaneous or casual communications.After announcing a wave of actions against big Wall Street banks last September, regulators launched a new investigative sweep into investment advisers, Reuters was first to report.We ""know that other SEC-regulated entities have committed similar violations, and so our work to enforce industry-wide compliance continues,"" SEC deputy enforcement director Sanjay Wadhwa said in a statement.Spokespeople for BNP, which agreed to pay a combined $110 million; Societe Generale SA, which agreed to pay a combined $110 million; Mizuho, which agreed to pay $25 million to the SEC; Houlihan Lokey, which agreed to pay $15 million to the SEC; SMBC Nikko Securities, which will pay $9 million to the SEC, and Moelis, which agreed to pay $10 million to the SEC, all declined to comment.Representatives for Wedbush, which agreed to pay $16 million to the regulators, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.(Reporting Chris Prentice in New York; Additional reporting by Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu in Washington, Nivedita Balu in Toronto and Nupur Anand, Lananh Nguyen, Saeed Azhar in New York; Editing by Michelle Price, Bernadette Baum, Jason Neely and Aurora Ellis)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the place with the most expensive weed in the world, the global cannabis industry, the budding cannabis-based pharmaceutical industry and the interest of big pharma, and the rise of e-commerce in the cannabis industry, and go directly to 5 Cities with the Cheapest Weed in the World. Before the war on drugs put marijuana farmers firmly in its crosshairs, cannabis was being grown openly and with commercial success on every continent on earth, much as it had been for centuries. However, with the passage of time, marijuana came to be perceived as a threat to the order of society, and stamping it out naturally began with laws on prohibition. Most Expensive Weed in the World: Before we step into the realm of cheap ganja, let’s talk about the place where indulging in marijuana will put a serious dent in your wallet. According to Price of Weed – a website that uses self-reporting to aggregate prices in various countries – Bermuda is the place with the most expensive weed in the world, where a gram of the herb will set you back by over $50. Global Cannabis Industry: As we mentioned in our article – 20 Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in the World– the global cannabis market was valued at $47.32 billion in 2022, and is projected to grow from $57.18 billion in 2023 to $444.34 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 34% during the forecast period. North America dominates the market and is projected to be the fastest growing region. Marijuana legalization is gaining momentum around the globe, driven primarily by the increasing recognition that the product may have a range of legitimate medicinal benefits and therapeutic applications. It is the most widely cultivated, trafficked, and consumed drug worldwide. Cannabis-based Pharmaceutical Industry: The FDA understands that there is increasing interest in the potential utility of cannabis for a variety of medical conditions. In 2018, the federal watchdog approved the country’s first-ever drug derived from marijuana – Epidiolex. Produced by GW Pharmaceuticals, the drug is used to treat two rare forms of epilepsy. Story continuesThe $7.2 billion acquisition of GW Pharmaceuticals by the global biopharma giant Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ) in 2021 is the latest sign of the growing legitimacy and increased receptivity of cannabis-based drugs in the pharma industry. With the new purchase, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ) – which has focused primarily on sleep medications and oncology – has augmented its neuroscience portfolio. Net product sales of Epidiolex reached $746.4 million in 2022 – an increase of 12% from the previous year – according to an announcement by Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ). Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has also entered the medical cannabis industry, betting on a promising cannabinoid-based bowel disease treatment. In December 2021, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced the acquisition of the clinical-stage company Arena Pharmaceuticals for a total equity value of around $6.7 billion. By acquiring all the shares of Arena for $100 per share in an all-cash transition, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has joined other big pharma companies in the cannabis space. E-Commerce in the Cannabis Industry: Demand for online ordering, e-commerce, and delivery options spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic and many businesses were forced to evolve. As an essential business during the lockdowns, cannabis dispensaries and brands needed to take steps towards e-commerce platforms to meet growing consumer demands. Ultimately, this pandemic-driven shift in e-commerce sales motivated many cannabis brands to implement online dispensary management software and management systems. Jane Technologies is a California-based startup building the backends for dispensaries that are quickly taking their offerings online, and the platform accounted for 20% of all legal cannabis sales in the U.S. in 2021. The company announced a $100 million Series C financing round in August 2021, bringing the total amount raised since its founding in 2015 to $130 million. According to Jane Technologies, online sales account for 38% of all legal cannabis sales. In 2020, the company powered more than 17 million orders totaling over $2 billion in transactional volume. The retail tech company launched its first iOS app in 2022 and even launched an innovative point-of-sale platform for cannabis dispensaries last month. With that said, here are the Cities with the Lowest Prices of Weed in the World. 20 Cities with the Cheapest Weed in the WorldMethodology: To collect data for this article, we have referred to the 2023 Cannabis Price Index by the CFAH, looking for the Cities with the Cheapest Weed in the World. To keep our list relevant, we have only selected larger cities with populations of 200,000 or more. When two cities had the same price of weed, we ranked them by their annual cannabis consumption instead. If you also wish to invest in the cannabis industry, here are the 11 Best Marijuana Stocks to Buy Now. 20. Northampton, UKPrice of Weed per Gram: $9.1Recreational cannabis has been illegal in the U.K. since 1928 and today, cannabis is classified as a Class B – or middle risk – substance. In theory, possession of cannabis can still land you with five years in prison. However, if you’re a first-time offender and have only a small amount on you, then you are more likely to get off with just a cannabis warning. 19. Boise, ID, USAPrice of Weed per Gram: $9.1While its neighboring states allow recreational and medical marijuana use, Idaho remains strictly bud-free. This causes hundreds of customers and workers to make the pilgrimage from Idaho to the neighboring town of Ontario (OR), which is home to 11 dispensaries. According to Debbie Folden – the mayor of Ontario – the city’s cannabis market caters almost exclusively to Idaho residents. 18. Glasgow, UKPrice of Weed per Gram: $9Weed is the most popular illegal drug in Scotland. Though recreational weed is banned in the country, the medical use of cannabis became legal in 2018. In June, 2021 Scotland prescribed its first dose of cannabis to treat medical conditions, namely chronic pain. Polls have shown that around 47% of the people living in Scotland supported weed legalization. 17. Albuquerque, NM, USAPrice of Weed per Gram: $9Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced in April that the state of New Mexico saw $300 million in adult-use cannabis sales in its first year, which began in April 2022. New Mexico’s relatively low prices are the result of a competitive market that reflects low barriers to entry for licenses, which is in contrast to many other states. Albuquerque is among the U.S. Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in 2023. 16. Novi Sad, Serbia Price of Weed per Gram: $8.9Cannabis is illegal for recreational purposes in Serbia but the country has a limited medical marijuana program. Serbia is among the countries with low cannabis prices, lower than its surrounding countries. 15. Las Vegas, NV, USAPrice of Weed per Gram: $8.9Since Nevada legalized weed in 2017, the Las Vegas Strip generally smells like marijuana and that’s not really the image that the city’s various hotels and casino operators want. But a new Nevada law allowing consumption lounges will change that and the first legal cannabis lounges have been approved.Las Vegas ranks 15th in our List of Cities with the Cheapest Weed.  14. Adelaide, AustraliaPrice of Weed per Gram: $8.6Adelaide is home to the cheapest recreational weed in Australia. When compared to legal medical marijuana, the price of illegal weed is less than half of what you would pay for prescription buds. 13. Los Angeles, CA, USAPrice of Weed per Gram: $8.3The price per pound of cannabis fell in 2021 because of massive overproduction across California. The tough competition from the black market also forces retailers to keep prices low, as 2 out of every 3 cannabis purchases are made in the illicit market. With $5.3 billion in legal sales last year, the Sunshine State is the Largest Cannabis Market in the World. 12. Bristol, UKPrice of Weed per Gram: $8.2Bristol was named as the ‘Weed Smoking Capital of the U.K.’ in 2017. A government report into ‘drug misuse’ found that more people in the ‘West Country’ reported smoking cannabis than anywhere else in the U.K., with 8.4% of the population having used it in the previous year. 11. Denver, CO, USAPrice of Weed per Gram: $7.8In July 2022, price per pound of flower fell to $709 in Colorado, the lowest since the state revenue department started reporting prices in 2014. That’s nearly half of what it cost to get high in 2020.Colorado is the cheapest place to live with weed in the U.S., as it has a relatively high median household income and a lower cost of living. 10. Saskatoon, CanadaPrice of Weed per Gram: $7.7Though there are no official numbers on street drugs, research suggests that legal cannabis pricing has even become competitive with that of illicit cannabis in Saskatchewan. After the province dropped the cap on cannabis retail stores in 2020, Saskatoon alone ballooned from six retailers to more than 30 in just a year. 9. Calgary, Canada Price of Weed per Gram: $7.4Calgary is home to SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL), one of the largest private-sector liquor and cannabis companies in Canada. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) develops and distributes liquor and cannabis products through its banner businesses. The company was formerly known as Sundial Growers Inc. and changed its name to SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) in July 2022. Calgary ranks among the top 10 cities with the cheapest weed in the world. 8. Toronto, CanadaPrice of Weed per Gram: $7.3Inflation may be at multi-decade highs, but the Canadian marijuana producers are slashing prices to fight for market share, resulting in Canada being one of the countries with the cheapest weed in the world. Prices for recreational and medical cannabis in 2022 were 8.3% and 10.2% lower respectively, as compared to the previous year. Toronto is one of the most weed-friendly cities in the world. 7. Portland, OR, USAPrice of Weed per Gram: $7At $7 per gram, marijuana prices in Portland are lower than they’ve ever been because the market is saturated with product and the demand isn’t growing. Portland was declared the ‘Best Weed City’ of 2023, according to a study by Real Estate Witch and Leafly. 6. Madrid, SpainPrice of Weed per Gram: $6.8In Madrid, cannabis clubs aren’t strictly legal. Instead, they operate in a legal gray area in which ‘members’ join clubs and ‘share’ cannabis that they grow. ‘Donations’ are exchanged for tokens, which are then used to purchase products. The Spanish capital ranks 6th among the Cities with the Most Affordable Weed in the World. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Cities with the Cheapest Weed in the World.Suggested Articles:26 Biggest Marijuana Companies in the World30 Drunkest Cities in America in 2023Top 20 Alcohol Drinking Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 20 Cities with the Cheapest Weed in the World  is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Analysts at Jefferies said its full year guidance could be seen as conservative as it implied a 1% upgrade to consensus after a bigger beat in the first half.Analysts at JPMorgan also noted a more cautious outlook on Australia, where Flutter's first half revenues fell by 1%.The Paddy Power, Betfair and PokerStars owner has accrued investment-driven losses in the U.S. since the 2018 lifting of a nationwide ban on sports betting in the belief that its revenues there will grow five-fold to around $15 billion long term.Flutter's U.S. revenue overtook that of its most profitable UK and Ireland market in 2022 and it recorded adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) there of 49 million pounds ($62.5 million) to June 30 versus a 132 million pound loss a year ago.The U.S. profits contributed to reported EBITDA of 765 million pounds across the group, versus the 731 million pounds forecast by eight analyst polled by Refinitiv.FanDuel, which contributed 98% of the 1.8 billion pounds of first half U.S. revenue, generated a 79 million pound profit in the period with the overall U.S. earnings dragged lower by the FOX Bet and PokerStars businesses.Flutter and broadcaster Fox Corporation said last month it would close the FOX Bet sports betting platform.A recovery in its UK and Irish business drove first half earnings there 24% higher, while its leading share of the U.S. sports betting market was 47% versus 50% in the first quarter with its slice of U.S. iGaming steady at 23%.Flutter said it expects full year adjusted U.S. earnings of 90 million to 190 million pounds, as it invests further in the second half, and earnings in the rest of the group to be between 1.44 billion and 1.6 billion pounds.That would eclipse the record full year earnings of 1.4 billion pounds Flutter posted during the COVID-19 online betting boom of 2020.

A Deep Dive into its Valuation,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-corp-foxa-modestly-undervalued-163421491.html,1691512461,STORY,"['FOXA', 'VALU']","[Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) stock has seen a daily gain of 5.56% and a 3-month gain of 8.28%. With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 2.13, the question arises: is the stock modestly undervalued? This article aims to answer this question by conducting a comprehensive valuation analysis. Read on for an in-depth exploration of Fox's intrinsic value.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FOXA. Click here to check it out. FOXA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FOXAFox represents the assets not sold to Disney by predecessor firm, Twenty First Century Fox in 2019. The remaining assets include Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, Big Ten Network, 28 owned and operated local television stations of which 17 are affiliated with the Fox Network, Tubi, and the Fox Studios lot. Since the Disney sale, Fox has acquired other related and unrelated assets including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The Murdoch family continues to control the successor firm, which represents a large-scale bet on the value of live sports and news in the U.S. market.Comparing the stock price to the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, provides a snapshot of the company's potential value. This approach paves the way for a more profound exploration of the company's value, ingeniously integrating financial assessment with essential company details.Is Fox Corp (FOXA) Modestly Undervalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from GuruFocus' exclusive method. The GF Value Line gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesThe stock of Fox gives every indication of being modestly undervalued based on GuruFocus' valuation method. GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $34.92 per share, Fox stock gives every indication of being modestly undervalued.Because Fox is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Is Fox Corp (FOXA) Modestly Undervalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthIt is always important to check the financial strength of a company before buying its stock. Investing in companies with poor financial strength have a higher risk of permanent loss. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great way to understand the financial strength of a company. Fox has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.51, which is worse than 64.4% of companies in the Media - Diversified industry. The overall financial strength of Fox is 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Fox is fair.Is Fox Corp (FOXA) Modestly Undervalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Fox has been profitable 7 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $14.90 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $2.13. Its operating margin is 18.79%, which ranks better than 89.39% of companies in the Media - Diversified industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Fox at 8 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Fox is 10.2%, which ranks better than 77.22% of companies in the Media - Diversified industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0.2%, which ranks worse than 56.02% of companies in the Media - Diversified industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets.

Meta's, then Facebook, 2019 plans to launch a stablecoin, Libra, were foiled after regulators raised fears it could upset global financial stability.For banks to receive a written nonobjection to be able to engage with stabelcoins, banks should demonstrate appropriate risk management, including having systems in place to identify and monitor any potential risks, including cybersecurity and illicit finance threats, according to the Fed.After receiving a written nonobjection, state member banks engaging in dollar token-related activities will continue to be subject to supervisory review as well as heightened monitoring of those activities, the Fed said.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 10 Most Important Entrepreneurs of All Time. Entrepreneurship Trends in 2023AI has become a disruptive force in the world of entrepreneurship, one of the most profitable professions in the world, which is yielding remarkable outcomes as there is statistical evidence of its impact. The rapid adoption of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, which garnered over 1 billion visits within three months of release, speaks volumes about its versatility in tasks such as copywriting and cash flow forecasting. Startups are embracing AI to stay ahead of market demand, with over 40% of failures attributed to misreading the market.The cost-saving potential of AI is also evident, as it enables startups to automate tasks which reduces the heavy burden of payroll expenses. As AI continues to grow, it empowers entrepreneurs with better marketing budget allocation, improved decision-making, and enhanced data-driven strategies, creating a dynamic workforce that anticipates future AI trends. By prioritizing AI proficiency and harnessing its capabilities, entrepreneurs can position themselves for success in the AI-driven future of business.On the other hand, startups and small businesses are gaining momentum, fueled by a global passion for problem-solving and a burgeoning spirit of entrepreneurship. Governments around the world are recognizing the crucial role entrepreneurs play in driving economic growth and are increasingly fostering environments conducive to innovation, with policies aimed at supporting startups and facilitating access to capital.For example, over its 70-year history, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has played a vital role in supporting small American businesses, which constitute 99.9% of all businesses and employ 46.4% of private sector employees. Under President Biden, there has been record job growth and a historic small business boom as entrepreneurs have applied to start 12.2 million new small businesses.Story continuesMoreover, the SBA has expanded its programs to meet the changing needs of small businesses while addressing issues of capital access gaps for rural, veteran, women, and minority-owned businesses. During the pandemic, the SBA became even more critical, to prevent the devastating impact seen during the 2008 financial crisis on minority and women-owned businesses. As a result of government, corporate, and philanthropic support, Black/African American- and Hispanic/Latino-owned businesses have shown remarkable growth, with average revenues increasing by 32.7% and 17.1%, respectively, compared to 2019.Entrepreneurs with a LegacyIn the vast tapestry of human history, few figures have left an indelible mark on the world like entrepreneurs have. Those pioneers of innovation and risk-takers have reshaped industries, revolutionized economies, and catapulted society into new eras of progress.However, to truly understand the essence of entrepreneurship, we must journey back to its historical roots. Ancient merchants and traders paved the way for the entrepreneurs of today, and challenged national borders to exchange goodsand thus set the foundation for global commerce.One such iconic figure was Andrew Carnegie, a 19th-century industrialist who revolutionized the steel industry and truly set the stage for the America’s industrial might. If his net worth from then is adjusted according to the inflation today, it would be around $372 billion which would make him the richest entrepreneur of all time, even richer than Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, who are two of the most famous entrepreneurs in the world.Another legend, Thomas Edison, was a game changing prolific inventor and entrepreneur whose inventions, like the phonograph and the electric light bulb, transformed modern living. Edison's pursuit of innovation and his belief in the power of research and development laid the groundwork for future generations of inventors. He is considered one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. Speaking of legendary entrepreneurship, one of the most prime examples of influential entrepreneurship that has shaped the world on a global scale is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) revolutionized personal computing and later transformed industries formusic, smartphones, and tablets. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s innovative products, like the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, redefined user experiences and set new standards for design and functionality.While it is true that legendary entrepreneurs are rare, when it comes to wealth-building, the newer generations have challenged the notion of toiling away for years to become wealthy.

202,5c23061a-e905-3079-9806-3705bd7bda9a,PYPL,2023-08-09,PayPal’s New Stablecoin and the ‘2 Wolves’ Inside Crypto,CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-stablecoin-2-wolves-inside-174532005.html,1691516732,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Here’s some confirmation that crypto isn’t entirely toxic: In the hours after internet payments pioneer PayPal announced a stablecoin on Ethereum, the company’s stock rallied 2%. That may seem a tiny rally for anyone used to triple-digit gains on s**tcoins, but is respectable in the world of late-stage, slow-growth tech companies that have just about reached peak market saturation (PayPal reports having more than 400 million active users, and accounts for ~70% of eBay transactions).Of course, as ever in the world of crypto, it’s not all sunshine and roses: After the surprise PYUSD stablecoin announcement, a bevy of imposter tokens like “pepeyieldunibotsatoshidoge” (aka PYUSD) have launched on Ethereum, various layer 2s and BNB Smart Chain looking to capitalize on post-announcement ignorance and buzz. The largest of these saw nearly $3 million in trading volume in mere hours, and almost assuredly more than a few will turn out to be rug pulls.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.But this isn’t new for crypto, an industry racked by competing visions, contradictory strategies and occasional moral scruples. As the meme goes: inside crypto are two wolves. There’s money crypto and tech crypto. Regulation wanters and law-avoiders. The build-and-break-things contingent and those who go slow and steady.It’s enough headbutting and disagreement to wonder how exactly crypto made it this far – that one of the most used payments companies is tapping the Ethereum mainnet, high fees be damned, for its next rung of expansion.And so PayPal’s stablecoin is no different: PYUSD, which to begin with is U.S.-only, will eventually be a near-universally accessible payments option that is subject to just as much surveillance and “censorship” as PayPal or its subsidiary Venmo today. It’s crypto, sans crypto – or fintech with the benefit of blockchain. It’s the two wolves in conflict.Story continuesIt should be no surprise which wolf is dominant in PayPal, the side that wants to work from within the system, rather than outside. The publicly-traded company, which launched the careers of Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and the rest of the “PayPal Mafia,” learned pretty quickly that its initial vision for a stateless, global payments system would be beaten into submission by banks and governments. PayPal has been an active and consistent supporter of crypto since it expressed interest in Bitcoin in 2013, but it gave up on the cypherpunk ideal of a “new world currency.”PayPal’s stablecoin may come with restrictions (no self-respecting extropian coder has ever signed a “terms of use” contract), but the company should be commended on its apparent commitment to transparency. As ex-PayPal comms director and typewriter aficionado James Wester says, “so long as freeze and seize is in the t’s and c’s” (terms and conditions) then there’s no real reason to complain that the PYUSD smart contract code has functions to confiscate and burn tokens.I mean, freezing tokens is standard practice among the major, corporate-backed stablecoins including USDC and USDT – as is the commitment from Paxos, the actual issuer of PayPal USD, to publish a monthly “reserve report” starting in September. Does all this also cut against the idea that crypto should break free from third-party financial companies that control who people can transact with online, who can access an account and collect data about clients’ transaction history. Indubitably, my good man, welcome to the era of Censored Crypto; it started 10 years ago and is only picking up.(To be fair to Tether, it did say it wouldn’t always abide by the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions program.)But when big news like this comes along from big brands outside the world of crypto, all of the industry’s political commitments seem to matter less. A “Bankless” podcast co-host was saying this the biggest deal since PayPal announced in 2020 it would allow users to transact in crypto, largely because PayPal is like training wheels for the heavier stuff like decentralized finance (DeFi). In fact, as hardly noted anywhere, it’s not PayPal’s entire 435 million strong customer base that has access to the stablecoin, but only the U.S. residents who have already purchased crypto on PayPal.That restriction will likely lift in time, and PayPal may ultimately onboard more people into crypto than Coinbase (108 million at last count). And even if only a fraction of those customers ever interact with Web3 beyond PayPal this doesn’t have to cheapen crypto’s purity (which frankly has already been tainted). It’s not like the existence of PYUSD means bitcoin or ether or dai will disappear. And as Austin Campbell, who formerly managed the BUSD stablecoin reserves at Paxos, wrote: “A player like PayPal entering the field is material, for credibility, for access, for public education and to force everyone else to start grappling with the reality of blockchains and the types of commercial applications they enable.”See also: Is PayPal Going to Fine You for Your Opinions? | OpinionBut it is interesting to imagine exactly what Web3 would look like if a company like PayPal was a major crypto services provider, or even what the company’s own vision for Web3 in five years will be. There is little doubt that PayPal will have to abide by U.S. sanctions, develop lengthy blacklists and use automated software to (sometimes erroneously) freeze accounts; that it will likely have underpaid comms people doing its crypto customer service. More people will be in crypto, but like the internet after the “Eternal September” that brought a critical mass of people online (and necessitated the need for digital-first payments options like PayPal), crypto may become unrecognizable to today’s users.Saying whether that is good or bad is like picking a preference in a wolf fight, a futile attempt to apply human morals to nature.

ALB.5 Lucrative Value Picks Based on Discounted PEGIn a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register more than 20% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2022. This favorably compares with a 10% rise of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period.Several other stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here we discuss five such stocks — Alibaba Group, Encompass Health, Molson Coors Beverage, Ford Motor and Albemarle Corp.More on Value InvestingWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales and price/book value (P/B).This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.Story continuesThe PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the five out of the 27 stocks that qualified the screening:Alibaba: It is one of the leading e-commerce giants in China. Over the last few years, the company has transformed itself from being a traditional e-commerce company to a conglomerate that has businesses ranging from logistics and food delivery to cloud computing.Alibaba Group is currently represented by three businesses — Alibaba.com, Taobao and Tmall.Alibaba currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of A.

212,3a400028-3f8b-382f-b80c-b905dbf97c2d,AES,2023-08-09,15 Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-worst-performing-utility-stocks-104807279.html,1691578087,STORY,"['NEE', 'KEN.TA', 'BNRG.TA', 'NFE', 'MNTK', 'ES', 'AESC', 'HTOOW', 'ARTNB', 'CWEN-A', 'UGIC']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 worst performing utility stocks in 2023. If you want to skip out on our introduction about the utility sector and how it became quite important last year, then head on over to 5 Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 2023. The utility industry became one of the most important sectors of the market last year due to the shock of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on global energy markets. The worst hit markets were those in Europe, which had come to rely on large amounts of Russian crude oil and even larger amounts of natural gas. As the war started, and these supplies became risky and contributed to funding the Russian war effort, Europe started to diversify its energy supply chain.The crisis also caused energy and crude oil prices to jump to record high levels in early 2022. While naturally this was a good thing for the oil companies, especially since the petro giants such as TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) made record profits, the reality is a little bit more complex since not all companies were able to earn billions of dollars in revenue from elevated oil prices. Research from economists at the Bank of Italy shows that Russia accounted for 29% of the EU's crude and 43% of its natural gas imports in 2020 - a sizeable reliance that is not easy to break away from.The research shows that when we take a look at two proxies for the financial performance of non-financial European companies part of STOXX Ltd.'s Eurostoxx 600 index, their equity returns drop inversely to their energy intensity while their default risk grows. Energy intensity is the extent that a firm relies on energy for its operations, for example, a large manufacturing company is likely to have a higher energy intensity than a retailing or hospitality company.Narrowing our focus down to the utility industry, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) measured market sentiment in July 2022 when the initial shock of the invasion was at its highest and investors were looking at ways to balance the high interest rate environment with a disruption to the stock market that had hit technology and high growth stocks but boosted the prices of oil companies. Their research, dated November 2022, shows that historically, only 22% of the largest power and utility (P&amp;U) companies had delivered higher shareholder returns than you would expect from a typical S&amp;P 500 company. However, by July 2022, this had grown by more than three times to sit at a whopping 68% - indicating the sudden boost in the fortunes of utility companies was similar to their oil peers as both were bathing in share price growth and higher revenues.Story continuesMoving forward to the current climate, 2023 has seen energy prices stabilize which has also led to a drop in inflation in developed and advanced economies. And naturally, this slowdown in their markets has also impacted the share prices of utility companies. The S&amp;P 500 Utilities index is down by 9.4% year to date and the Dow Jones Utility Average lags this fall by one percent since its year to date performance is negative 8.4%.We've also taken a look at the biggest utility companies in the world to find out that the top three firms as of last year were PJSC Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and China Yangtze Power Co Ltd (SSE:600900). As to the outlook for the rest of this year and what's currently happening in the sector, here's what the management of NextEra had to say during the firm's second quarter of 2023 earnings call:After a period of underlying commodity price inflation, supply chain disruption and trade policy risk premiums, we are finally seeing signs of stability, which will be helpful in our customer conversations. We believe renewables remain economically attractive to alternative forms of generation, and position ourselves to meet long-term customer demand by expanding our significant pipeline of renewable projects. Today, we have a pipeline of roughly 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects in various stages of development. This includes projects in early stage diligence in our current backlog, and is supported by roughly 145 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions. When you combine our significant competitive advantages with our renewable pipeline, we believe Energy Resources is well positioned for growth and our renewable business for years to come.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the worst performing utility stocks in 2023 so far, with the top ones being Via Renewables, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIA), Heliogen, Inc. (NYSE:HLGN), and Fusion Fuel Green PLC (NASDAQ:HTOO).15 Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 2023Photo by Max Bender on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the worst performing utility stocks this year, we simply compiled and ranked all utility companies by their year to date returns and listed the ten worst performing stocks right now.Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 202315.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Stocks of many of these banks closed down by more than 1%. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) and the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) both dropped more than 1% as well.Moody’s attributed its decisions to a series of pressures making life more difficult for mid-sized financial institutions across the country, from higher deposit costs and eroding profitability to new capital requirements and a commercial real estate slump.The trigger for many of these issues is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to cool inflation with higher interest rates. Moody's said that campaign ""continues to have a material impact on the US banking system’s funding and its economic capital.""""I don't think that the ratings downgrades suggest that there's more weakness coming that we didn't already see,"" JPMorgan US equity strategist Abby Yoder told Yahoo Finance Live, describing what happened as a ""rearview mirror"" look at the sector.The move downward in many regional bank stocks, she added, had more to do with the fact that many of these stocks had rallied in recent weeks.In fact, many investors pushed stocks higher following a series of second quarter earnings that appeared to ease any lingering fears that mid-sized financial institutions faced the sort of existential threat that surfaced in the spring when the failures of three sizable banks triggered outflows across the banking system.Story continuesDeposits were up at most smaller banks, even those that suffered outflows during the first quarter.But there was one troublesome trend that emerged from those second quarter results. Namely, most regional banks attracted more deposits during the quarter by paying a lot more for them, thus cutting into a key measure of profitability.Many, as a result, revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year, including PNC and Truist.Fifth Third also trimmed its full-year forecast range for net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and what they pay for their deposits.""We're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well, and if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings,"" Fifth Third chief executive Tim Spence said last month.The fresh volatility introduced by Moody's may come in handy for regulators as the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency try to sell a complex overhaul of new capital standards for banks.They argue the changes are needed to make lenders stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for shocks like the crisis of this spring.The new capital proposals are expected to face pushback from the banking industry, which argues that lenders are much more resilient than they were during the 2008-09 financial crisis and that higher requirements could restrict lending.Many midsize banks that could be part of these new rules are already making adjustments by holding back on any increases in dividends or share buybacks. Several also are selling assets to reduce the risks on their balance sheets or examining a pullback in certain types of lending.Banks are ""doing the right things,"" Yoder, the JPMorgan equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live, citing the restructuring of balance sheets ahead of new regulatory requirements.Banks will probably be less profitable, but in the long term, she added, ""they will be in better shape.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

There were official downgrades for the likes of M&amp;T Bank, Pinnacle, Webster Financial. 11 banks in total were put on a negative outlook including larger lenders like PNC, Capital One and, Citizen's. Those are all falling in premarket trading. Bigger plays like Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp, and State Street are all under review for a potential downgrade.And the good times keep rolling for Eli Lilly.

If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Pinnacle West Capital's ROIC was 2.68, while its WACC came in at 4.65.Is Pinnacle West Capital Corp (PNW) Modestly Undervalued?ConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Pinnacle West Capital Corp (NYSE:PNW) shows every sign of being modestly undervalued.

The service is beginning its chainwide rollout this summer and is slated to be available at all the 1,700-plus stores with Starbucks Cafés and Drive Up service by October.""Our guests have long told us Drive Up is a game-changer, adding convenience to their daily life, especially when they're short on time,"" said Mark Schindele, chief stores officer, Target.

Target worked with Starbucks in the development of the experience and then piloted the Drive Up with Starbucks service in 2022 and 2023 with the help of team members at select stores. Throughout the pilot phase, Target's store teams tested the process to make sure it was efficient and easy for team members — and enjoyable for guests. True to its test-and-learn approach, Target continues to fine-tune the experience.The Drive Up with Starbucks national rollout comes on the heels of another recent enhancement to the Drive Up service: the ability to make a product return free of charge.

By definition, these enterprises represent publicly traded technology firms that enjoy a strong buy consensus view – or the equivalent.To be fair, if you’re looking to load up on tech stocks, going with the heavily endorsed ideas might not give you a bargain rate. Like anything in life, it’s give or take. If you want the predictability of top tech stocks, you’re going to sacrifice upside potential. On the flip side, if you want dramatic, life-changing returns, predictability will often go out the window.At the same time, analyst-supported ideas may offer a more sensible approach. With the Federal Reserve dealing with a difficult economic framework of seeking disinflation in a hot labor market, risk-on enterprises may have a short shelf life, especially if interest rates continue to rise. On that note, below are the best tech stocks to buy now, according to the experts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7A powerhouse among strong buy tech stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) might appear to have lost some of its thunder. After all, other enterprises have made significant gains in areas such as AI. However, the company deserves respect because its Google ecosystem likely isn’t going anywhere. For example, Google currently owns 92% of the global search engine market.According to information provided by TipRanks, analysts presently peg GOOG as a strong buy – well, that’s the point of this story, right? This assessment breaks down as six buys, two holds and zero sells. Further, the experts’ average price target lands at $142.63, implying a bit over 8% upside potential.On a financial note, GOOG doesn’t offer the greatest discount. For instance, shares trade hands at a forward earnings multiple of 23.2. That’s a bit higher than the sector median of 22.71x. Still, Alphabet enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 22.9%. It’s also consistently profitable, warranting consideration for one of the top tech stocks.Story continuesAmazon (AMZN)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comEasily one of the most well-known strong buy tech stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) first inked its name into the cultural lexicon through its e-commerce business. It pretty much pioneered the online marketplace industry. From there, it launched into myriad other innovations such as cloud computing. By being an integral component of the ground floor of the consumer economy, Amazon isn’t going anywhere but up on a long-term basis.Unsurprisingly, Wall Street analysts agree with this overall assumption. Indeed, AMZN isn’t just a run-of-the-mill strong buy tech stocks. Rather, it’s a unanimous strong buy based on 29 analysts. Overall, their average price target lands at $152.52, implying nearly 16% upside potential. Interestingly, the high-side price target stands at $204, implying nearly 55% growth.Now, no one investment is perfect. If you want to load up on tech stocks on the cheap, AMZN isn’t it. Right now, shares trade for 82X forward earnings. That’s expensive. However, the company still represents a growth machine with a three-year sales expansion rate of 21.9%. Again, it’s a solid idea for the long haul.Mastercard (MA)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comWhile technically not one of the pure-play ideas among the best tech stocks to buy now, financial services firm Mastercard (NYSE:MA) deserves consideration. Regarding the theme of the hour, the company has invested heavily in its payment technology solutions and customer experiences. On a fundamental note, Mastercard may see a cynical upside as more people turn to plastic to make ends meet.Another reason to peg MA as one of the strong buy tech stocks centers on its universal appeal among the expert class. Per TipRanks, Mastercard presently carries a unanimous strong buy view among 19 analysts. Further, their average price target clocks in at $461.44, implying over 16% upside potential. In addition, the high side target comes in at $526, implying over 32% growth.As with the other ideas, if you want to load up on tech stocks at a discount, Mastercard isn’t the best idea. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 32.59. In contrast, the credit services sector runs a median multiple of 8.86. However, Mastercard is relevant and enjoys robust and consistent profitability.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn exceptionally enticing idea for strong buy tech stocks, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) specializes in minimally invasive care. Thanks to its da Vinci surgical system, medical doctors can perform complex operations accurately while yielding minimal recuperation period in hospital for patients, thus reducing costs and burdens across the board. Unsurprisingly, ISRG gained 22% of its equity value since the January opener. It’s also up nearly 36% in the trailing year.Again, following in line with the theme, analysts peg ISRG as a strong buy. It’s not a unanimous vote though it’s darn close. Among 14 analysts, only two dissented, choosing to assess shares as a hold. Overall, the experts’ price target lands at $377.14, implying over 16% upside potential. The high-side target comes in at $400, implying over 23% growth.As with many other celebrated top tech stocks, ISRG carries a rich premium of 59x forward earnings. It also trades at 17.38X trailing revenue. However, its balance sheet is robust with zero debt. That’s worth keeping in mind.Microsoft (MSFT)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comWhile an incredibly boring enterprise if you’re looking to load up on tech stocks, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes up for it with its exceptional relevance. Sure, everybody loves their portable smart devices from that “fruit” company. However, when it comes to running business applications on desktops, Microsoft Windows beats out everybody else. It’s not close.Of course, Microsoft has been aggressively investing in other areas, particularly AI. Thanks to its partnership with OpenAI and its remarkable chatbot ChatGPT, the deal adds new life to MSFT. Subsequently, analysts responded in kind, making MSFT one of the strong buy tech stocks.Although MSFT does carry one hold and one sell view, 30 other experts believe it’s going places. And that place would be an average price target of $391.63 or over 16% up. Along with the other ideas for the best tech stocks to buy now, I can’t say that MSFT is remarkably cheap. Although priced at 30.35X forward earnings, Microsoft is pretty much fairly valued. More importantly, the company delights shareholders with solid top-line growth and excellent profit margins.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to graphics processing units (GPUs), the main rival of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gets plenty of love. However, investors seeking to load up on tech stocks that want to try something different might want to consider AMD. Fundamentally, the company provides almost-identical relevancies: develop high-powered processors that can undergird the needs of advanced AI protocols.Given the importance of semiconductors for AI-based solutions, it’s no surprise that AMD ranks among the strong buy tech stocks. In this case, among 31 analysts, 24 rated shares a buy. Of those who are not quite ready to commit to a buy rating, they issued a hold. Still, if time represents any importance, the most recent six ratings are all optimistic. Right now, the average price target lands at $136.36, implying 16% upside potential.Similar to Advanced Micro’s rival, AMD is pricey, trading hands at over 41x forward earnings. As well, it runs a revenue multiple of 8.28. Still, the company prints a very robust three-year revenue growth rate of 35.7%, outflanking 89% of the competition.GlobalFoundries (GFS)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chart. Hyper-Growth Stocks to BuySource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comA multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) ranks among the most important names for best tech stocks to buy now. While the Covid-19 crisis symbolized a sharp lesson for society, it particularly highlighted economic vulnerabilities. Too much of our tech supply chain depends on Asia. To mitigate this dynamic, GlobalFoundries may help boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.To no one’s shock, GFS qualifies as one of the strong buy tech stocks. In fact, at the time of writing, GFS was only one analyst shy of a unanimous buy view. However, an assessment of 13 buys and one hold is a good day at the office. On average, the experts’ price target stands at $76.48, implying nearly 23% upside potential. Also, the high-side target is $100, implying almost 61% growth.In its totality, GFS appears fairly valued, trading at a trailing earnings ratio of 22.55X and a forward earnings ratio of 28X. Interestingly, the market prices GFS at an enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio of 9.63X, favorably lower than 66.22% of the competition. Therefore, it might be one of the best tech stocks to buy now.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Royal Caribbean Group should not be overlooked. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.72. These indicators suggest that Royal Caribbean Group, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underscores the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreThe Altman Z-score, invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany OverviewRoyal Caribbean is the world's second-largest cruise company, operating 64 ships across five global and partner brands in the cruise vacation industry, with 10 more ships on order through 2026.

The company also has a 50% investment in a joint venture that operates TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, allowing it to compete on the basis of innovation, quality of ships and service, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations, and price.Unmasking the Value Trap: A Deep Dive into Royal Caribbean Group's (RCL) Financial HealthBreaking Down Royal Caribbean Group's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Royal Caribbean Group's Altman Z-score reveals potential financial distress.

This downward movement indicates Royal Caribbean Group's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt, exerting a negative impact on its Z-Score.Conclusion: Navigating the Value TrapDespite the seemingly attractive valuation of Royal Caribbean Group's stock, the low Altman Z-score and declining Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio suggest potential financial distress.

Credit: Gary TramontinaRegions Financial is adding new capabilities to the customer billing service that it offers to corporate clients, enabling them to deliver and track invoice-related communications with their own customers by text or email.The communications service is the latest part of a suite of treasury management products that the Birmingham, Alabama-based bank provides to its business customers.Expresso, an online dashboard for companies to manage communications with their customers, provides users with a platform to exchange documents such as billing statements and invoices, as well as to engage in email marketing campaigns, according to Florida-based Nordis Technologies, which developed the software that Regions is using.Over the last year, many banks have bolstered their treasury management businesses, which provide fee income at a time when rising interest rates are cutting into the margins that banks earn on loans.Citizens Financial Group, for example, launched a real-time payment processing service for its commercial banking business last year and hired 50 former First Republic bankers in June to expand its treasury management group.Regions customers that sign up for Expresso will pay a fee to use a Regions-branded version of the product, said Greg Miles, the bank's manager of treasury management products and services.He said that Expresso will enable the bank's corporate clients to interact with their customers securely.""It facilitates a jump start into mass communication with our clients' customer base,"" Miles said.The treasury management business provides the $156 billion-asset bank an avenue for expansion amid slower loan growth and a decline in deposits earlier this year.After Regions reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth during the second quarter, CEO John Turner said during the bank's earnings call last month that there was ""further opportunity in our existing customer base"" to continue to expand the treasury management business.Story continuesRegions said that the Expresso communications platform will allow the bank's corporate clients to manage the entire lifecycle of accounts receivable from a single platform. Customers that prefer to use non-digital methods of communications will be able to use Expresso for print production and mail services.Regions hopes the platform will complement its earlier adoption of BillerXchange, an automated billing service developed by Mastercard, according to Miles.Regions has rolled out a number of digital services as it focuses on expanding its treasury management business.In September, the bank launched iTreasury, a real-time payments service for corporate banking clients. And in December, it added a new product for corporate business travel called Visa Commercial Pay.Miles said that the bank's expansion of third-party treasury management services is less about finding ""shiny objects"" to offer clients, and more about identifying ""what our customers need and want.""""What makes us successful is that our products represent demand from our clients relative to problems they're trying to solve,"" Miles said.]"

These will cater to the needs of its business clients.The above-mentioned platforms bring together the bank’s customer billing and communication services into an integrated channel. The platforms will provide small businesses to major employers to manage their electronic bill presentment and payments simultaneously.Regions Bank clients can enroll in the BillerXchange platform, which is powered by Mastercard, for bill presentment and payment services. This platform enables companies to accept online payment receivables and offers their customers an intuitive and seamless digital experience.Enabled by Nordis Technologies, clients will also have access to Expresso — a customer communications management software — which helps Regions Bank clients to generate and record communications to initiate payments from their customers. These communications can be addressed via text, email or print, per the convenience of the parties involved.The platform allows clients from various healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, distribution, wholesale industries and other professional services sectors, to manage the entire lifecycle of accounts receivables from a single integrated platform. For clients who are not enrolled in BillerXchange, RF enables the option to use Expresso's separate add-on solutions such as print production and mail services to meet their communications needs.Bryan Ford, head of Treasury Management for Regions Bank, stated, ""At Regions, we are committed to delivering the resources our business clients need to accelerate cash flow and improve overall cash management. At a time when business clients often need to do more with less, automation and technology provide efficient alternatives to the manual process of billing and receivables.""Ronnie Selinger, founder and CEO of Nordis Technologies, commented, ""Nordis Technologies is proud to provide businesses greater choice and convenience with a range of options for communications and payments.

EFX.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2133601/5-financial-transaction-stocks-in-focus-amid-steady-consumer-spendingThe Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from expanding transaction volumes resulting from the widespread adoption of digital means. An advanced digital solutions suite, built on mergers and acquisitions as well as tech investments, equips players to capitalize on a booming digital era. Signs of subsiding inflation might pave the way for increased consumer spending in the days ahead.Recovery in travel is likely to drive cross-border volumes. Companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and Equifax Inc. are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe, facilitating the switching of transactions and permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryA Booming Digital Environment: The pandemic made people aware of the hassle-free and affordable nature of contactless payments. Even after the pandemic receded, the digitization trend showed no sign of slowing down across the globe. A higher Internet penetration rate and increased usage of smartphones contribute to the increased uptake of digital payments.In light of the prevailing scenario, it has become inevitable to build an enhanced contactless payments suite or upgrade the existing ones. For this, financial transaction services players have to often resort to technology investments that might escalate costs for them. However, owing to the long-term benefits that such investments provide, the industry players have come up with diversified contactless payment options such as mobile wallets, biometrics and QR codes.Such initiatives will enable the players to solidify their presence in the global digital payments market, boost their customer base and diversify income streams. To counter the growing number of cybercrimes that are often associated with online payments, industry participants remain equipped with fraud prevention solutions.Steady Rise in Consumer Spending: Improved consumer spending implies greater utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction services players. This, in turn, offers an opportunity for industry players to process higher transaction volumes. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market add to the purchasing power of consumers and subsiding inflationary headwinds boost hopes for continually rising consumer spending in the days ahead.Also, the ease with which e-commerce shopping can be done within the comfort of one’s home is likely to provide an impetus to growth in consumer spending. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in the January-June 2023 period, consumer spending in each of the months has witnessed an uptick sequentially.Improved Cross-Border Volumes: Increased travel, whether for business or recreation, will likely boost cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. With industrial and business activities back on track, the demand for international travel is likely to remain steady in the days ahead. Industry participants often come up with efficient business travel solutions that make flight bookings simpler. The ease of digital payments transcends the barrier between borders. Platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise aid in the seamless processing of digital payments.A Prudent M&amp;A Strategy: In addition to tech investments, a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy often becomes the means for building an efficient digital suite. The strategy also gives an opportunity to financial transaction services players to foray into new markets, expand their foothold in existing ones, broaden partner networks and increase customer base. However, interest rate hikes by the Fed to tame inflation result in higher borrowing costs.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

This compares to loss of $0.04 per share a year ago.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $10.8 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Loop Media: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, KLA investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$5.20 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, KLA has a trailing yield of 1.0% on the current stock price of $498.64. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for KLA If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. KLA has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 21% of its income after tax. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 22% of its free cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see KLA has grown its earnings rapidly, up 37% a year for the past five years. KLA looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. KLA has delivered an average of 13% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineIs KLA an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that KLA is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.On that note, you'll want to research what risks KLA is facing.

This comes on the heels of Verizon’s network being named Most Awarded for Network Quality, 31 Times in a Row by J.D. Power, the voice of the people**, and Verizon’s network being undefeated for overall network performance in 96.8% (121 out of 125) of the metro area tests RootMetrics performed in the first half of 2023***.These results come as a result of Verizon engineers deploying the newest technology, efficiently using spectrum assets, increasing the capacity of our fiber connections, building in redundancies throughout Verizon’s network for service assurance and relentlessly stress testing every aspect of the network.“Customers expect their mobile experience to work everywhere and all the time. That is why at Verizon we focus so much on reliability,” said Joe Russo, EVP and President, Global Networks and Technology for Verizon. “Our engineers are working every day across the country to test the reliability of our network. We obsess over our customers’ experience and are always grateful when those efforts result in recognitions like these.”Verizon’s network successes underscores a persistent, unyielding focus on innovation and continued investment to provide the very best for Verizon’s customers. Verizon’s award-winning network is grounded on best-in-class spectrum position, extensive fiber ownership, and the incorporation of advanced technologies deployed from the core to the edge. The company’s multi-purpose, network-building formula enables reliable, robust, secure, and high-performing connectivity that can accommodate a variety of use cases including mobility, private 5G networks and business solutions, and fixed wireless access broadband for consumers, businesses and public sector alike.Story continuesThe results of this national test capture a moment in time of an ever-changing network continuously evolving in this fast-paced environment. Since testing for this report began, Verizon has not slowed down.Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. Today more than 222 million people have access to Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service and that number is growing.Many of these deployments used Verizon’s  recently acquired C-band spectrum, designed to provide wide coverage for 5G Ultra Wideband service. Last year, months ahead of schedule, Verizon received access to additional C-band spectrum which it has been deploying aggressively across the country. This year, Verizon will gain access to the remainder of the spectrum they purchased in the auction doubling, and in some cases tripling, the amount of bandwidth available to serve customers. That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Even as engineers provide wireless service in more places, they are also enhancing the service by deploying leading edge, modernized technology in many areas. In states across the country, Engineers have upgraded the hardware in many of the cell sites adding capacity for more data to be used by customers, providing power efficiency, and providing virtualization. This technology milestone allows Verizon to rapidly respond to customers’ varied latency and computing needs, and provides greater flexibility and agility in the introduction of new products and services. The move to a cloud-based, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections across the nation so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.* Rankings based on the RootMetrics® State of 5G in the US Report: 1H 2023.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Lam Research Corp. LRCX, NXP Semiconductors NXPI and ON Semiconductor Corp. ON. Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog: 4 Solid Semiconductor Stocks to Buy as Sales Rebound in Q2The semiconductor industry that reached unprecedented heights following the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 has been struggling for months. However, the worst appears to be over as sales are finally rebounding, as projected by experts.After taking a hit last year, semiconductor sales are steadily improving. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), sales improved in the second quarter and are poised to grow in the near term as demand remains high across multiple industries.Semiconductors Sales Bounce BackAccording to the latest report from SIA, global semiconductor sales totaled $124.5 billion in the second quarter, up 4.7% from the first quarter. Also, sales grew 1.7% month over month in June to $41.5 billion.Sales are still down year over year but industry experts believe that the market will rebound in the near term as predicted earlier. Semiconductor sales have now grown for four straight months.John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said, “Although global semiconductor sales in 2023 remain behind the totals from last year, revenue ticked up in June for the fourth consecutive month and notched solid quarter-over-quarter increases, providing optimism the market will continue to rebound over the second half of the year.”The increased demand for electronic goods and the rise of remote working and learning during the pandemic led to a significant surge in semiconductor sales.Nevertheless, increased demand and supply-chain challenges caused by lockdowns led to a worldwide semiconductor shortage, disrupting various end-user industries such as automobiles, power, lighting and electronics.Story continuesIn 2022, the supply-chain crisis eased, and demand for semiconductors slowed. Despite the industry's ongoing challenges, 2022 became a standout year for the semiconductor sector, with sales increasing 3.2% to reach $573.5 billion from $555.9 billion in 2021.The current short-term decline in the semiconductor industry can be attributed to various interconnected factors, including increasing prices, geopolitical tensions and lingering pandemic aftereffects. Despite these challenges, the demand for semiconductors remains robust.The global adoption and growing utilization of consumer electronics, along with the expanding prevalence of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and machine learning technologies, are the key drivers of the increasing demand for semiconductors. This trend is expected to further bolster the demand for semiconductors in the foreseeable future.Our PicksGiven the bright prospects, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks. Below are four chip stocks that investors can gain from in the near term.NVIDIA Corp. is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and inventor of the graphic processing unit (GPU). Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms. NVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, necessary to run deep-learning algorithms.NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 38.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.4% over the past 60 days. NVDA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lam Research Corp. supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.

The product relies on high-bandwidth memory 3, or HBM3e, which is able to access information at a blazing 5 terabytes per second.The Superchip, known as GH200, will go into production in the second quarter of 2024, Nvidia said. It’s part of a new lineup of hardware and software that was announced at the event, a computer-graphics expo where Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang is speaking.Nvidia has built an early lead in the market for so-called AI accelerators, chips that excel at crunching data in the process of developing artificial intelligence software. That’s helped propel the company’s valuation past $1 trillion this year, making it the world’s most valuable chipmaker. The latest processor signals that Nvidia aims to make it hard for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. to catch up.AMD’s rival offerings, two versions of its MI300 design, will be in the hands of customers in the fourth quarter of this year. One version is a graphics chip, and one is a combination product like Nvidia’s Superchip. AMD’s components will work with another version of HBM3 memory.In the age of AI, Huang sees his technology as a replacement for traditional data center gear. He said that a $100 million facility built with older equipment can be replaced with an $8 million investment in his new technology. That type of facility would use 20 times less power, Huang said.Story continues“This is the reason why the world’s data centers are rapidly transitioning to accelerated computing,” he told the audience. “The more you buy, the more you save.”Read More: Bubble in AI Stocks Is Nearing a Peak, Morgan Stanley SaysHuang has turned a 30-year-old graphics chips business into the top seller of equipment for training AI models, a process that involves sifting through massive amounts of data. Now that AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard are catching on with consumers and businesses, companies are racing to add Nvidia technology to handle the workload.Nvidia shares have more than tripled this year, bringing its valuation to about $1.1 trillion. That’s the biggest gain in 2023 for companies in the closely watched Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, by a long shot. Though Nvidia was down about 2% on Tuesday, it briefly pared the losses after announcing the GH200 chip.The Superchip will serve as the heart of a new server computer design that can handle a greater amount of information and access it more quickly — a key advantage given the tsunami of data flowing through AI models. Artificial intelligence training gets a boost if the chip can load a model in one go and update it without having to offload parts to slower forms of memory. That saves power and speeds the whole process up.In servers, two of the chips can be deployed together, offering more than 3.5 times the capacity of an existing model, Nvidia said. That will let customers deploy fewer machines or get work done far quicker.The latest Nvidia products are designed to spread generative AI — and its underlying hardware — to even more industries by making the technology simpler to use. A new version of the company’s AI Enterprise software will ease the process of training the models, which can then generate text, images and even video based on simple prompts.The lineup also includes new chips for workstations, computers designed for heavy workloads. New AI Workbench software, meanwhile, helps users switch their work on AI models between different types of computers.With the Workbench tool, users can move their models and training work from PCs to workstations to data centers and even public cloud services. The software handles the process of adjusting the AI software to fit the current platform. The idea is to help spur further demand for Nvidia’s processors, regardless of what system they’re running on.The Santa Clara, California-based company also announced a partnership with Hugging Face, a popular developer of AI models and data sets. Hugging Face will add a training service to its website that uses Nvidia DGX Cloud, allowing users to tap the chipmaker’s servers to handle their workloads.In addition, Nvidia is adding generative AI to its Ominverse offerings, a platform designed to support metaverse-style virtual worlds. The company is using the technology to help corporate clients create online versions of real-world things, such as factories and vehicles.To encourage others to use the technology, Nvidia has endorsed a standard called universal scene description that was originally developed by Walt Disney Co.’s Pixar. The chipmaker has formed an alliance with Pixar, Autodesk Inc., Adobe Inc. and Apple Inc. to try to speed up adoption.On the hardware front, Nvidia is releasing three new RTX graphics cards for workstations. The RTX 5000 is available now for $4,000 and will more than double the speed of generative AI and the rendering of images, Nvidia said. The chipmaker also introducing new servers based on the L40S graphics chip and a design for top-of-the-line workstations that use four of its RTX 6000 cards.(Updates with details of announced AMD in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekPrivate Equity Firms Are Slow to Sell Holdings Amid Higher RatesQuality Control Is a Secondhand Fashion Startup’s Key to GrowthWhen $1,600 a Night Is a Good Price for a Hotel©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Analysts at Jefferies said its full year guidance could be seen as conservative as it implied a 1% upgrade to consensus after a bigger beat in the first half.Analysts at JPMorgan also noted a more cautious outlook on Australia, where Flutter's first half revenues fell by 1%.The Paddy Power, Betfair and PokerStars owner has accrued investment-driven losses in the U.S. since the 2018 lifting of a nationwide ban on sports betting in the belief that its revenues there will grow five-fold to around $15 billion long term.Flutter's U.S. revenue overtook that of its most profitable UK and Ireland market in 2022 and it recorded adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) there of 49 million pounds ($62.5 million) to June 30 versus a 132 million pound loss a year ago.The U.S. profits contributed to reported EBITDA of 765 million pounds across the group, versus the 731 million pounds forecast by eight analyst polled by Refinitiv.FanDuel, which contributed 98% of the 1.8 billion pounds of first half U.S. revenue, generated a 79 million pound profit in the period with the overall U.S. earnings dragged lower by the FOX Bet and PokerStars businesses.Flutter and broadcaster Fox Corporation said last month it would close the FOX Bet sports betting platform.A recovery in its UK and Irish business drove first half earnings there 24% higher, while its leading share of the U.S. sports betting market was 47% versus 50% in the first quarter with its slice of U.S. iGaming steady at 23%.Flutter said it expects full year adjusted U.S. earnings of 90 million to 190 million pounds, as it invests further in the second half, and earnings in the rest of the group to be between 1.44 billion and 1.6 billion pounds.That would eclipse the record full year earnings of 1.4 billion pounds Flutter posted during the COVID-19 online betting boom of 2020.

A Deep Dive into its Valuation,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-corp-foxa-modestly-undervalued-163421491.html,1691512461,STORY,"['FOXA', 'VALU']","[Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) stock has seen a daily gain of 5.56% and a 3-month gain of 8.28%. With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 2.13, the question arises: is the stock modestly undervalued? This article aims to answer this question by conducting a comprehensive valuation analysis. Read on for an in-depth exploration of Fox's intrinsic value.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FOXA. Click here to check it out. FOXA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FOXAFox represents the assets not sold to Disney by predecessor firm, Twenty First Century Fox in 2019. The remaining assets include Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, Big Ten Network, 28 owned and operated local television stations of which 17 are affiliated with the Fox Network, Tubi, and the Fox Studios lot. Since the Disney sale, Fox has acquired other related and unrelated assets including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The Murdoch family continues to control the successor firm, which represents a large-scale bet on the value of live sports and news in the U.S. market.Comparing the stock price to the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, provides a snapshot of the company's potential value. This approach paves the way for a more profound exploration of the company's value, ingeniously integrating financial assessment with essential company details.Is Fox Corp (FOXA) Modestly Undervalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from GuruFocus' exclusive method. The GF Value Line gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesThe stock of Fox gives every indication of being modestly undervalued based on GuruFocus' valuation method. GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $34.92 per share, Fox stock gives every indication of being modestly undervalued.Because Fox is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Is Fox Corp (FOXA) Modestly Undervalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthIt is always important to check the financial strength of a company before buying its stock. Investing in companies with poor financial strength have a higher risk of permanent loss. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great way to understand the financial strength of a company. Fox has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.51, which is worse than 64.4% of companies in the Media - Diversified industry. The overall financial strength of Fox is 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Fox is fair.Is Fox Corp (FOXA) Modestly Undervalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Fox has been profitable 7 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $14.90 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $2.13. Its operating margin is 18.79%, which ranks better than 89.39% of companies in the Media - Diversified industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Fox at 8 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Fox is 10.2%, which ranks better than 77.22% of companies in the Media - Diversified industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0.2%, which ranks worse than 56.02% of companies in the Media - Diversified industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, Fox's return on invested capital is 12.33, and its cost of capital is 6.06.Is Fox Corp (FOXA) Modestly Undervalued? A Deep Dive into its ValuationConclusionOverall, Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) stock gives every indication of being modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks worse than 56.02% of companies in the Media - Diversified industry.

Now brace yourself for ESPN Bet, a rebranding of an existing sports-betting app owned by Penn Entertainment, which is paying $1.5 billion plus other considerations for exclusive rights to the ESPN name.The deal, announced Tuesday, could take Walt Disney Co.-owned ESPN into uncharted waters. Disney is fiercely protective of its family-friendly image, not typically associated with the world of sports gambling.Penn will operate ESPN Bet, which ESPN has agreed to promote across its online and broadcast platforms in order to generate “maximum fan awareness” of the app. ESPN Bet will also have unspecified “access” to ESPN talent, the companies said.Penn's rights to the ESPN brand will initially run for a decade and can be extended for another decade by mutual agreement. In addition to the $1.5 billion licensing deal, which will be paid out over a decade, Penn will also grant ESPN rights worth about $500 million to purchase shares in Penn.“Penn Entertainment is the perfect partner to build an unmatched user experience for sports betting with ESPN Bet,” ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in a statement.Disney has wrestled with the issue of adult-oriented entertainment in the past. Until about 15 years ago, its Walt Disney World park in Orlando, Florida, featured a gated late-night area known as Pleasure Island — actually a reference to the 1940 film “Pinocchio,” whose characters visited a den of iniquity by that name. Pleasure Island featured bars, music venues and nightclubs in addition to restaurants, shopping and a nightly countdown to “New Year's Eve” complete with fireworks.When attendance waned, Disney closed down the Pleasure Island nightclubs in 2008 and redeveloped the site as a restaurant and shopping district now known as The Landing at Disney Springs.ESPN added that it will use its platforms “to educate sports fans on responsible gaming” — for instance by continuing to cover the sports betting industry with “journalistic integrity,” creating a “responsible gaming” committee within the company and developing marketing guidelines that “safeguard” fans.Penn also announced that it sold Barstool Sports, an irreverent sports media site, back to its founder Dave Portnoy. Penn took a 36% stake of Barstool Sports in February 2020 for about $163 million and subsequently acquired the remainder of the company for about $388 million in February 2023. Neither Penn nor Portnoy disclosed terms of the divestment deal.In a video posted on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, Portnoy radiated excitement over the site's regained independence. The regulated gambling industry, he said, “was probably not the best place for Barstool Sports and the kind of content we make.” Portnoy added that he will “never” sell the company. As part of the divestment deal, Penn would be owed 50% of the gross proceeds from any future sale or “monetization” of Barstool.]"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer; and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Kevin Burdick, the Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2023 earnings and increased our full year 2023 financial guidance. Strength in volumes across our operations, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin, resulted in higher second quarter results and positive momentum entering the second half of 2023. We continue working toward a successful closing of our pending merger transaction with Magellan while remaining focused on the growth of our legacy assets. Initial activities have begun on 2 NGL pipeline expansion projects. The growth we are seeing across our existing operations is driving the need for these economically attractive projects. Walt and Kevin will talk more about the early work that we are doing on the Elk Creek and West Texas natural gas liquids toplines. Regarding our pending acquisition of Magellan Midstream. We've recently accomplished 2 critical milestones toward completing the transaction, including the expiration of the HSR waiting period in June and the filing of the definitive proxy materials with the SEC in July. Proxy mailings are already hitting investors' mailboxes. As we look ahead to the shareholder and unitholder votes on September 21, we're confident that the investors of both companies will see the compelling long-term value proposition this transaction brings with immediate financial benefits and incremental growth through the combination of these 2 companies. Today, we will walk you through both the macro and micro takeaways of our synergy assumptions. I will cover the macro and Kevin will go into more detail with the macro explanations. On Slide 6 in our earnings presentation, which was provided yesterday with our news release, you will see a summary of how we've organized the synergy opportunities we've identified to date and have targeted to realize as a combined company. You can see we have slided these commercial opportunities into 4 categories and have provided a breakdown for both the assumed scenario in our proxy and for the incremental potential near-term commercial opportunities. So now I'd like to cover the macro takeaways from Page 6 previously referenced. First, combined, these companies will have opportunities that were not possible as stand-alone companies. Second, batching and blending are done by both companies today. Therefore, these operational techniques are well understood by both companies. They are not new. But the difference is with these assets under one company's direction, batching and blending value can be realized on a larger scale. Third, with the exception of bundling, the 3 remaining commercial categories are within 100% of our control. This means that we make the decision to pursue opportunities if they make commercial and economical sense instead of relying on factors outside of our control. Fourth, as we integrate the 2 employee bases post close, we can focus on widespread collaboration and believe that we will find even more opportunities not identified to date. And finally, there is significant potential value in the near term, the next 1 to 4 years, above our assumed case in the proxy. ONEOK has proven our commercial creativity over the course of our company's transformative history, and together with Magellan's team, we believe our companies have many opportunities to continue improving the services that we offer to our customers and returning value to our investors. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt Hulse, for the discussion of our recent financial performance and guidance increase.Walter S. HulseThank you, Pierce. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2023 financial guidance expectations. We now expect a 2023 net income midpoint of $2.49 billion and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $4.675 billion, a $100 million increase from our original adjusted EBITDA midpoint provided in February. These midpoints are ONEOK specific and exclude the impact of the pending merger with Magellan and any future merger-related costs in order to be an apples-to-apples comparison with our original guidance provided in February. Higher guidance expectations were driven by volume growth, volume strength across our operations, higher average fee rates and lower-than-expected third-party NGL fractionation costs. In the second quarter, we recorded $31 million of third-party fractionation costs compared with $46 million in the first quarter. We expect approximately $30 million of third-party fractionation costs per quarter to be a good run rate for the remainder of the year as MB-5 is fully operational. Strong producer activity and a constructive volume outlook also drove the increase in our capital expenditure guidance. We now expect total capital expenditures, including growth and maintenance capital, of approximately $1.575 billion in 2023. Initial activities, including the purchase of long lead time components related to the expansion of Elk Creek pipeline and the decision to complete the full looping of the West Texas NGL pipeline are included in our updated guidance. Kevin will provide more detail on these projects shortly. Now a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance. ONEOK's second quarter 2023 net income totaled $468 million or $1.04 per share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $971 million, a 10% increase year-over-year. If you exclude merger-related and third-party fractionation costs, second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 15% and would exceed $1 billion. In June 2023, we redeemed $500 million of our 7.5% senior notes due September 2023 with cash on hand. Our net debt to EBITDA remains well below our long-term target of 3.5x, and we had more than $100 million of cash and equivalents as of June 30. Early in the second quarter, Moody's upgraded ONEOK's credit rating to Baa2 from Baa3. As it relates to our pending acquisition of Magellan, I'd note all 3 rating agencies, Moody's, S&amp;P and Fitch, reaffirmed our investment-grade credit ratings pro forma for the acquisition showing a recognition of increased scale, earnings diversity and growth opportunities that this acquisition provides. As it relates to merger transaction financing, we expect to complete a notes offering prior to the close of the transaction. We are monitoring the markets and will be opportunistic in our timing of that offering. I now turn the call over to Kevin for a commercial update.Kevin L. BurdickThanks, Walt. Let's start with our Natural Gas Liquids segment. Second quarter 2023 NGL volumes increased 11% year-over-year and compared with the first quarter 2023. Higher volumes were driven by increased producer activity, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin. Both regions saw double-digit volume increases year-over-year and compared with the first quarter 2023. Permian Basin volumes saw the largest increase, up 26% year-over-year, driven by continued growth from existing plants and volume from a new plant connection in the first quarter of 2023. Volumes in the Rocky Mountain region increased 17% compared with the first quarter of 2023 and 14% compared with the same period last year driven by increased propane plus volume and slightly higher incentivized ethane. Mid-Continent region volumes increased 8% compared with the first quarter of 2023, partially driven by increased ethane recovery. While we've seen ethane prices decrease recently from July highs, they remain at a level driving recovery in most basins. We think the recent volatility in ethane pricing is the market responding to some short-term dynamics along with the general tightening in the overall supply and demand balance. Given these market conditions, we remain confident in our ethane recovery assumptions included in our updated guidance. The Permian in near full recovery, the Mid-Continent in partial recovery and opportunities to incent recovery in the Williston. As Walt mentioned, we've begun initial work, including purchasing long lead time components for 2 NGL pipeline expansion projects. Activities are underway to complete the looping of West Texas NGL pipeline, which will more than double ONEOK's NGL capacity out of the Permian Basin. The full loop is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2025, which aligns with our customers' needs. We also are taking steps towards expanding the Elk Creek pipeline to 400,000 barrels per day to provide capacity for growing volumes in the Williston. In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, second quarter processed volumes averaged nearly 2.2 billion cubic feet per day, a 16% increase year-over-year. In the Rocky Mountain region, processed volumes averaged nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day during the second quarter and have averaged more than 1.5 bcf per day in the month of July. We've connected more than 280 wells in the region through the first half of the year compared with approximately 160 connections in the first half of 2022, a 75% increase. As we sit today, we're on pace to reach the high end of our 475 to 525 well-connect guidance range for the year. Currently, there are approximately 35 rigs and 20 completion crews operating in the basin with 19 rigs and approximately half of the completion crews on our dedicated acreage which remains more than enough activity to grow production on our acreage. In the Mid-Continent region, second quarter processed volumes increased 12% year-over-year and decreased slightly compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to the timing of new pads coming online. We've seen some recent decreases in STACK and SCOOP activity in the past few months but continue to see increased activity in Western Oklahoma as producers are focusing on higher crude producing areas. We currently have 9 rigs on our dedicated acreage in the Mid-Continent and have connected 23 wells in the region through the first half of the year. In the natural gas pipeline segment, strong year-to-date results continue to benefit from demand for natural gas storage and transportation services, and we now expect the segment to exceed the high end of its original earnings guidance range. We recently completed an expansion of our natural gas storage capabilities in Oklahoma, allowing us to utilize and subscribe an additional 4 billion cubic feet of our existing capacity. We have subscribed 100% of this incremental capacity through 2027 and 90% through 2029. We continue to evaluate the Saguaro connector pipeline, a potential intrastate pipeline project that would provide natural gas transportation to the U.S. and Mexico border for ultimate delivery to an export facility on the West Coast of Mexico. There continues to be positive developments related to the potential LNG export project with support from multiple large, well-known customers anchoring the project. We expect to make a final investment decision on the ONEOK pipeline later this year. Now I want to end where Pierce left off with a micro look at the Magellan transaction synergies. I will discuss how we define each category, an example of the opportunity, the sensitivities and comments on the overall risk weighting. The dollar ranges between our assumed case and the near-term potential are shown on Page 6 of our investor presentation for all 4 categories. Liquids pipelines provide opportunities to move natural gas liquids and refined products through the same product pipelines. Both companies refer to this as batching. This operational technique utilizes available capacity and combined connectivity to ship a refined product or natural gas liquid to a demand center to capture a higher value. An annualized average of 100,000 barrels per day in any combination of refined products or NGLs at $0.07 per gallon would result in more than $100 million annually. The ability to mix products to obtain a higher value is called blending. The combined assets will increase unleaded butane blending as well as other incremental blending opportunities, increasing an additional 25,000 barrels per day annually at a $0.20 per gallon uplift on any given slate of products or NGLs would result in approximately $75 million annually.As volumes grow or contracts expire, a wider variety of services can be combined or bundled to offer greater value to customers. This focuses on optimizing system utilization and connectivity to and from key customers and market centers. This is the one category where time and decisions, primarily by customers, will jointly be needed to realize this synergy. Picking up an incremental 25,000 barrels per day at $0.10 per gallon would provide approximately $40 million a year. Additional opportunities that can be realized within the 1- to 4-year time frame include incremental refined product, NGL, and crude oil storage and optimization activities. We also see value and opportunities to leverage Magellan's proven marine export expertise. We have consistently said that acquisitions of this size often result in a 25% reduction in G&amp;A cost, which, in this case, would be $200 million. However, we have assumed only $100 million in both the assumed case and the near-term potential case. It's also important to point out when the transaction was announced, we significantly risk-weighted our financial assumptions to come up with our total assumed $200 million of synergies. This should highlight the level of conservatism we've applied to our expectations and also the potential upside to our assumptions, which we think could drive synergies to more than $400 million. As we've said previously, we have a high level of confidence in achieving the assumed $200 million of near-term synergies. For obvious commercial reasons, we're not going to provide specific project level details at this time. However, we have provided realistic potential outcomes by categories. We believe our ability to batch and blend products on our combined pipeline systems as well as bundled services to increase value for customers will provide significant synergy opportunities over the next 1 to 4 years. Pierce, that concludes my remarks.Pierce H. NortonThank you, Kevin, and thank you, Walt. We've had a strong first half of the year with a promising second half still ahead of us. We continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business that have gotten us where we are today. These fundamentals include customer service, reliability, innovation and, most importantly, a focus on operating safely and responsibly. We have a long and successful track record of growing and transforming our business while innovating for future opportunities but even through change and advancements over our more than 100-year history, ONEOK employees have been consistent in their dedication to doing things the right way. In the coming weeks, we'll be publishing our 15th Annual Sustainability Report. I'd encourage you to review the report and see our many updates related to our environmental, safety and health performance, related targets, employee initiatives and examples of how we're economically participating in the future of energy transformation. We're proud to share our efforts and accomplishments, but we also know we can't stop there. As our company continues on our journey of growth, change and progress, we remain committed to operating responsibly and sustainably. As we look forward to increasing our operations, workforce and expertise through the merger of Magellan. We're also excited to join 2 companies with proud histories with a more promising future combined. I want to thank all the employees from both companies that are working on integration plans while continuing to run daily operations. We look forward to building on all that both companies have accomplished, creating a larger, more diversified company with a shared commitment to safety and stakeholder value. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS.Brian Patrick ReynoldsI appreciate the prepared remarks and slide details around the commercial synergy opportunities. I was curious if we could just view -- if we could talk about if we should view the upside opportunity of synergies to be around $800 million versus the original $200 million that you talked about when the deal was announced? And then second, are there any assumptions around growth synergies on Slide 6, just given the larger integrated framework that you'll have? And if not, how should we think about the size and scope of those opportunities?Pierce H. NortonSo I'll -- this is Pierce. Brian. I'll start out with some comments, and I'll let Kevin fill in or share in either one. So the $800 million is a list of opportunities that we have that's fairly lengthy as far as what the potential could be based on certain volume assumptions, pricing assumptions, and time. And so you come up with your list first, and then you have to go back and risk weight those as to what you think can realistically be done. I think in any of these transactions, you want to come up with the most comprehensive list possible realizing that you may not get them all. So we're very comfortable in that range of $200 million to $400 million. And so -- but we wanted to add the color to kind of show how we risk weighted both into that assumption.Brian Patrick ReynoldsGreat. Appreciate that. And I guess just a follow up, is there -- can you talk about the size and scope of those potential growth synergy opportunities, whether it's downstream, I guess?Kevin L. BurdickBrian, it's Kevin. No, I mean we've kind of provided as much as we're going to provide at this time. Again, just for competitive reasons, we're not going to -- we don't -- we prefer not to get into the details at this time of some of that. A lot of these will happen with not a lot of capital. Some may require a little bit, but we'll work those details as once we get closed and get into it.Pierce H. NortonThe only thing I'd add to that, Brian -- this is Pierce -- is there's not one large opportunity in any one of those buckets that's driving it. It's multiple opportunities.Brian Patrick ReynoldsFair enough. And if I may just -- I know it's a little bit too early to discuss what the final company will look like post-merger but kind of just curious if you could just talk about leverage for a larger integrated company. We've seen NGL peers take leverage to 3x. And we've seen some recent spin co announcements talk about 5x as being the right number. So just kind of curious as a combined entity, what do you think the right leverage target is for ONEOK and Magellan?Walter S. HulseWell, we definitely haven't changed our view on where we want to be from a long-term standpoint. We've heard out there that 3.5x, we thought was a good benchmark for us. We are going to trend that direction pretty quickly with this transaction. And as we said in the past, we have no issue if we trend a little bit lower than that 3.5x. But we think that puts us in a good position to take advantage of opportunities as they come down the road over time.OperatorThe next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.Jeremy Bryan TonetJust wanted to start with the underlying -- the fundamental business -- fundamentals of the underlying business here. With the results that you've had raising the guidance as far as we are into '23 just wondering if you could talk a bit more on operational momentum in the business right now. How you see that trending into '24 to the extent you're able to comment and specifically with regards to the numbers put forth in the prospectus and knowing that that is not guidance, but just wondering if there's any frame of reference you can provide there is how you see results potentially shaping up versus that number?Kevin L. BurdickJeremy, it's Kevin. I think it's shaping up very well. The activity levels we're seeing across our footprint really in all 3 of the major areas. And even a little activity in the Powder, but primarily the Bakken and the Permian announcing or talking about these expansion projects that we're pushing forward to me signals that volume's coming and the activity levels we're seeing right now in the Williston and the Permian would absolutely dictate that we would be continuing to grow as we move through '24.Walter S. HulseJeremy, the one thing I might do is give you a little bit of context on those numbers that were in the proxy. Those were numbers that were developed in September of '22 for our board meeting in November where we got the 2023 plan approved. The numbers for 2023 were the primary focus of those numbers. But as we've made -- as we stated in these conversations, and you'll remember, if you looked at the proxy that it goes back to September of 2022, we were using the same numbers for our board that we were using in our planning process. They were not a forward projection of our full view of what we would do in outer years. It was a pretty good view of 2023. So as we see these business opportunities grow, we will give guidance for '24 and beyond when we get to February and in future periods.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. Maybe just one more cut at this. Is there any way, I guess, to provide color on what inputs were for -- driven into the 2024 numbers, such as Bakken rig count or other? And how they trend now versus what you saw at that point in time?Walter S. HulseLike I said, I think that you should think about those numbers with the primary focus on 2023 to try to look forward 15 months and give a rig count is something that we don't typically try to do. We usually freshen that up and the team is actively thinking about that as we head into the fall for 2024.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. Just real quick last one, if I could. If you could provide updated thoughts on the West Texas LPG loop and Elk Creek, what type of project economics you see for those investments?Sheridan C. SwordsJeremy, this is Sheridan. I'll start with the West Texas completing that loop. So we're just finishing completing the loop that we started in 2018. It's a very low cost per barrel of capacity loop, and we'll be adding the pipeline capacity when it's done coming out of the Permian will be well over 700,000 barrels. We have contracts in place that give us a very nice return on that project with still a lot of capacity left to be contracted as we go forward. So we're very excited about that project. I think that's going to be a very, very low multiple projects when we're done, high return. On the -- coming out of the Elk Creek as we continue to see volume grow in the Elk Creek on obviously, out of our G&amp;P presence up there, where we have a large majority, 60% of the market share up there and then off of what volumes we see from third parties that we've already contracted. We now see the opportunity that we need to grow this pipeline to make sure we don't get caught short. So with the margins we see on there and just putting in pumps on our pipeline and just the last bit of capacity, it's going to be another very high-return, low-multiple project on that. So obviously very excited as we continue to grow forward. Just another example, as we said, we will not get caught short of volume coming out of the Bakken.OperatorThe next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.Theresa ChenFirst, I'd like to get a little bit more detail on the batching opportunities. Do you have examples of which types do you see the most upside for batching? And are you already seeing commercial interest in this? And just what underlies that $0.07 per gallon estimate.Sheridan C. SwordsI think we, this is Sheridan again. I'll give you 1 example of what we can do it as a batching opportunity is obviously with our Sterling pipeline that runs in between the Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent region. We can put refined products on that to move refined products in between those 2 locations on the safe pipeline as we are moving NGLs on that pipeline as well. So that's an example of an area where we could be moving back and forth between 2 areas on refined products on the NGL pipeline. That's an example of batching.Theresa ChenAnd what underlies the $0.07 estimate for the illustrative estimate?Sheridan C. SwordsThe reason we use $0.07 illustrated estimates, that's kind of what we see the overall tariff in between those 2 areas tend to be from more on the refined products pipeline as we see that, then obviously, there could be upside to that as we go forward, depending on where the markets are. But that's -- we wanted to use a number that was out there in the market, and that's what we see today.Theresa ChenGot it. And on the blending piece, are you -- within this illustrative example, are you looking to blend 25,000 barrels per day of incremental butane into the gasoline pool? Or are you looking to expand margins by $0.20 for 25,000 barrels per day?Sheridan C. SwordsI think we see a lot of opportunities in both areas. We're trying to give you an idea of what the impact could be and give you more of a notionally where we're thinking about going on that. It could be both. We could be -- we think that there's opportunity for increased margin. We also think there's an opportunity for increased volume. But we're trying to give you an idea of what the impact could be and a little bit of sensitivities around that. That's how we came up with the numbers that we gave you.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.Michael Jacob BlumI want to go back to the proxy again for a minute specifically on the CapEx in the proxy for 2023, it's higher than your revised CapEx guidance here this morning. So I'm wondering if you could just explain the variance there? And then does that imply that '23 CapEx could go higher if you FID more projects for the balance of the year?Walter S. HulseMichael, if you -- again, think of the timing when we did it. This is back September of last year. At that point in time, we thought the Saguaro pipeline would be further along in its process. We've now said that we expect FID between now and the end of the year. So that just from a timing standpoint, that analysis assumed that the Saguaro pipeline was fully included. And with the timing moving on that and some other projects, we see some of that kind of shifting out, some of it won't be realized that we will actually do it, and there may be other projects. The capital, as we look at commercial opportunities is continually revisited and the number that we gave you today is our expectation for 2023.Michael Jacob BlumOkay. Perfect. And then I just wanted to ask on the Elk Creek expansion, I'm assuming that this will be brought on in phases. So is that correct? And anything you can provide in terms of a timeline for when you'll be adding capacity? And then what is the cost of the project?Kevin L. BurdickMichael, it's Kevin. On the timing, we're not -- we're just going to -- we're not going to get caught short. As we look at our customers, we're going to make sure we've got that capacity there. We're still working through. And on the cost, we're given consistent with the NGL expansion as well, we decided to give here's what the impact is going to be in '23 as we move forward and we get to '24, then we'll provide -- it will be included in those numbers there as well.OperatorThe next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi.Spiro Michael DounisMaybe just to follow up on some of these questions and starting with CapEx. It sounds like these pipeline expansions are going to be pretty capital efficient. But maybe you could just give us a general sense of the trajectory on CapEx going into '24 on a stand-alone basis. Obviously, Mont Belvieu 5 dropping off you still have Mont Belvieu 6, you've added these pipeline expansions. And so directionally, without Saguaro, let's say, it doesn't seem like it's trending in any particular direction versus '23.Kevin L. BurdickI mean, this is Kevin. Again, we're not going to start guiding to '24 yet, but just notionally, you think about the projects, we've got our -- at the activity levels we're seeing, it'd be relatively consistent from just kind of that routine stuff. So to the extent we don't announce any other larger projects than it would be in the ballpark. But again, like Walt said, we're constantly looking at projects. We're evaluating projects and some pop and get to the point where we execute and others don't. So it's kind of hard to say. But we don't -- there's nothing we're seeing other than Saguaro. It's more pipeline expansion type stuff.Spiro Michael DounisGot it. And second question actually is on Saguaro. I know you're still working towards an FID there. But I guess I'm just curious if you've seen any incremental interest beyond the LNG project downstream of that pipeline? And if you're also sort of feeling any interest from potential JV partners yet?Kevin L. BurdickOur focus right now on Saguaro is -- I mean, like we said in the remarks, there have been some positive developments, that's great. But our focus is on continuing to drive out and ensure we get the presidential permit and the timelines we need and continuing to refine our estimates, and we're focused on that -- the U.S. side of that pipeline.OperatorThe next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank.Tristan James RichardsonKevin, you talked a little bit about the volatility we saw in June and July around ethane. But can you talk about maybe the dynamic you're seeing in the north obviously, with a tighter market at Belvieu with relief on the way and then obviously, weather's impact there. Were we able to see some incentivized ethane come in, into June? And then just curious maybe what you're seeing in the third quarter?Kevin L. BurdickJust -- I'll start. And just in general, at a high level, the environment does bounce around. That's why we talk about we'll have opportunities to incentivize ethane. Once again, you've got to look at what's going on with gas prices up north in Canada and what's going on with Belvieu ethane. So we've had those opportunities. It's moved around. We're not going to provide the specific volumes. But again, it continues to be an opportunity for us. I mean Sheridan, anything to add?Sheridan C. SwordsOne thing I'd add with that is that with this -- we had a big run-up in ethane prices, and it came off and overall is still higher than it was in the first part of June, which has allowed the Mid-Continent for later part of June, July and into August to be in full ethane recovery.Tristan James RichardsonThat's helpful. And then maybe, Walt, I understand we're not talking about '24 CapEx just yet or even identifying the cost of specific projects at this point. But maybe can you talk a little bit about long lead time procurement in '23 and maybe just generally what proportion of a project that might be?Walter S. HulseWell, I think that I would -- as you look forward, kind of think about it this way, that as Kevin mentioned, most of what we're looking at is build-outs from our existing system whether it's expansions or add-ons to that. So at the moment, we don't have any significant sized project that we have looming out there other than we've obviously talked about the potential of the Saguaro pipeline. And the long lead times. In this environment, you always have to be on that game. And so we are looking at that as it relates to all of our projects and how we can be there to meet the needs of our customers going forward. So that's just a reality in this day and age.OperatorThe next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.Jean Ann SalisburyKevin, can you give a little bit more detail on why the gas pipeline segment is doing so much better than guidance? It seems like a lot of it is from renegotiating storage up to higher rates. So if you can give any kind of direction on how much of your storage capacity has been renegotiated up to the current rates already? And how much might be yet to come, that would be helpful as well.Kevin L. BurdickJean, really, it's just segment hitting on all cylinders. There's a variety of things. I mean, absolutely, after Uri, the increase in storage, both from an amount of storage contracted up and the rates we were getting that was a benefit. The segment has seen an opportunity, again, through its retained fuel and some gas sales to be opportunistic there. That's been strong. And with some market dynamics and how they've handled here recently parking loans and so forth has been a little bit of a benefit to us. So really, the segments just performed outstanding, and we continue to find other projects as well. We're not done as it relates to looking at other storage opportunities, expansion opportunities, whether it be in Texas or Oklahoma. So again, segment is just doing a great job capturing the market opportunities that are provided.Jean Ann SalisburyGreat. And one more for you, if I can. It seems like Bakken volumes are outpacing your expectations a bit. If you can just kind of say whether that's primarily been a function of more oil growth overall, higher GOR than you forecast or more ethane recovery than you forecast or just all 3, that would be helpful.Kevin L. BurdickWell, when we think about gas, the gas production, that wouldn't have as much ethane recovery, but it's definitely the activity levels we're seeing, the productivity, it's a combination of both of those. Producers just continue to get better and better when it -- as it relates to their drilling techniques, their completion techniques, some of the length of the laterals has expanded in certain areas. All those things really go into giving us, again, a lot of strength as we exit Q2, where we're at and where we think it's going to go. So you're right. We do see strength, and we think we're in a great position.OperatorNext question comes from Neil Mehta with Bank of America.Neil MehtaI noticed on the G&amp;P side, you hit kind of the top end of your rate at $1.20 Mcf. I was wondering kind of the factors behind that, whether it was inflation, more wells driven towards the Bakken? And then how any commodity sensitivity would play into that and if that rate is sustainable going forward?Sheridan C. SwordsNeil, this is Sheridan. A lot of that, obviously, the increase in rates is going to be -- we had inflationary factors in there. Depends on the contract mix where -- what contracts coming in there. We've renegotiated contracts. So it's overall, as we move through, we continue to improve those contracts, to go forward. But I think one of the biggest ones is probably more of the inflationary escalators having the biggest impact.Neil MehtaOkay. And then just a general question on the commercial synergies with batching, blending, bundling. How much of these synergies are kind of spread based and opportunistic versus finding new demand centers where kind of serving demand on a baseload basis.Kevin L. BurdickNeil, this is Kevin. I'll take it, and again, we're not going to get into project-specific details. But I think Sheridan mentioned earlier, it's going to be -- those opportunities are going to be a mix of both. It's going to be volumetric, and it's going to be rate. And to the extent we can find opportunities for the higher rates, great. If it's more volume, that's great, too. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.OperatorThe next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.Keith T. StanleyFirst, just a quick follow-up on the blending synergies, the $70 million to $195 million. Is that predominantly butane blending? Or are there other types of product blending activities you see with the merger? I asked just because Magellan's business today is about $150 million a year on butane blending. So the synergy number is just pretty large.Sheridan C. SwordsKeith, this is Sheridan. We see some opportunities in butane blending, but we see opportunities in other blending as well, not just on butane, but other NGLs into different products. We see -- be able to expand that and be able to actually do the butane blending that is being done today also cheaper.Keith T. StanleyGot it. And second question, just want to better understand the components of Saguaro. So it seems like Mexico Pacific's made really good progress with the trains being fully commercialized the first 2 anyway. Can you give an update on where you see things for the connecting pipeline in Mexico? I just have not heard as much about that. Is your understanding there's a lot that needs to be done on that to move forward? Or that's progressing well as well and consistent with your timeline?Kevin L. BurdickWell, again, this is Kevin. Keith, the remarks I made earlier, we're going to stick to those. We're working -- there have been some positive developments, like you said. But at the end of the day, we're focused on the U.S. side and making sure we are in line with the overall timing and needs of the projects. So that's our focus right now is really on the U.S. side.OperatorThe next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist.Jacob Samuel NivaschThis is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Just one for me. Going back to the synergies, but just touching on the different segment, the bundling part knowing like you guys said this is not entirely in your control, but I just wanted to get a sense, should we assume the synergies or the potential synergy opportunity that you're seeing here, is that -- would that be like evenly spread throughout the, I guess, 1- to 4-year time -- just near term in general? Or is that going to be lumpy potentially? Just trying to get a sense of the dynamics there.Sheridan C. SwordsYes, Neal (sic) [Jacob], this is Sheridan. Yes, there's some -- I think there's some opportunities near term, but it is going to be a little bit lumpy. As we said in the remarks, it's a lot is going to be dependent on when contracts come up and as we continue to see how these 2 assets work together and multiple touch points with the same customer is going to create opportunities. So we're going to see some in the beginning and then as contract roll off, will be lumpy throughout the 4-year time period.OperatorThe next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.Craig Kenneth ShereYou add existing asset and commodity optimization synergies, I just want to dig in a little different manner, more into Brian's question on combined growth project opportunities. I understand you don't want to get into commercially sensitive areas maybe relating to crude transport, exports and all kinds of other things. But would it surprise you to see the combined business perhaps produce $2 billion to $3 billion more aggregate incremental growth project opportunities at your normal historical 4x to 6x build multiple by late decade.Walter S. HulseCraig, I think I would leave you with the thought that a lot of these opportunities are incremental off of our existing assets or Magellan's assets. So in most cases, we're expecting very low return -- very high return, low multiple opportunities. So not an enormous amount of capital that is necessary to make those hit. We will continue to evaluate that and see if there are other growth opportunities that come up. But I think that we would expect to be at the lower end of that 4x to 6x, if not significantly better than that.Craig Kenneth ShereGot you. And one other follow-up, maybe a little over the skis on this because you've got to finish the merger, but -- once we get past that, do you intend to break out commercial synergies on an ongoing basis?Pierce H. NortonThis is Pierce. We are in the process of deciding exactly how we're going to report all these segments. And then when we make that decision, we're going to move forward. But we're reporting by segment the way that we report on our business. As far as -- we'll give you as much detail as we possibly can without compromising anything we have from a competitive advantage standpoint.OperatorThe next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.Sunil K. SibalThanks for all the details on the MMD transactions synergies. I was just curious, so it seems like where things stand now with regard to this transaction, there are some aspects of the transaction, which are beyond OK use control. So I was kind of curious if this weren't to go per the plan, what are some of the other levers that OK could pull to accelerate growth in the forward years?Pierce H. NortonWell, I think the way I'd answer that question is that both companies right now, we're focused on the vote. Magellan is focused on their vote and ONEOK, we're focused on our vote. We believe that the Magellan unitholders and the ONEOK shareholders are going to see the value in this deal, the combined companies. And I think we're scratching the surface there because when we get these 2 companies combined, I think and get our employees collaborating together, I'm very confident in the innovation of both companies is going to turn out to be something that people are going to really be proud that they voted yes for this deal.Sunil K. SibalAnd then one clarification question. It seems like ONEOK filed a shelf last week for additional equity. So I was just curious if you could provide some context around that?Walter S. HulseSure. I'm actually glad you asked that question. That is just renewing the ATM plan that we have had in place for better part of 7 or 8 years. We've had -- we have not utilized that within the last 5 years and don't really have any expectation to utilize it going forward. But we do think it's a nice liquidity tool to have in our -- to have available to us, but there is no expectation that we would be using the ATM on a going-forward basis.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Stocks of many of these banks closed down by more than 1%. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) and the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) both dropped more than 1% as well.Moody’s attributed its decisions to a series of pressures making life more difficult for mid-sized financial institutions across the country, from higher deposit costs and eroding profitability to new capital requirements and a commercial real estate slump.The trigger for many of these issues is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to cool inflation with higher interest rates. Moody's said that campaign ""continues to have a material impact on the US banking system’s funding and its economic capital.""""I don't think that the ratings downgrades suggest that there's more weakness coming that we didn't already see,"" JPMorgan US equity strategist Abby Yoder told Yahoo Finance Live, describing what happened as a ""rearview mirror"" look at the sector.The move downward in many regional bank stocks, she added, had more to do with the fact that many of these stocks had rallied in recent weeks.In fact, many investors pushed stocks higher following a series of second quarter earnings that appeared to ease any lingering fears that mid-sized financial institutions faced the sort of existential threat that surfaced in the spring when the failures of three sizable banks triggered outflows across the banking system.Story continuesDeposits were up at most smaller banks, even those that suffered outflows during the first quarter.But there was one troublesome trend that emerged from those second quarter results. Namely, most regional banks attracted more deposits during the quarter by paying a lot more for them, thus cutting into a key measure of profitability.Many, as a result, revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year, including PNC and Truist.Fifth Third also trimmed its full-year forecast range for net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and what they pay for their deposits.""We're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well, and if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings,"" Fifth Third chief executive Tim Spence said last month.The fresh volatility introduced by Moody's may come in handy for regulators as the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency try to sell a complex overhaul of new capital standards for banks.They argue the changes are needed to make lenders stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for shocks like the crisis of this spring.The new capital proposals are expected to face pushback from the banking industry, which argues that lenders are much more resilient than they were during the 2008-09 financial crisis and that higher requirements could restrict lending.Many midsize banks that could be part of these new rules are already making adjustments by holding back on any increases in dividends or share buybacks. Several also are selling assets to reduce the risks on their balance sheets or examining a pullback in certain types of lending.Banks are ""doing the right things,"" Yoder, the JPMorgan equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live, citing the restructuring of balance sheets ahead of new regulatory requirements.Banks will probably be less profitable, but in the long term, she added, ""they will be in better shape.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Moody's has downgraded ten small and medium-sized U.S. banks, including M&amp;T (MTB), Pinnacle (PNFP), Webster Financial (WBS), and issued negative outlook warnings on larger financial bodies like PNC, Capital One (COF), and Citizen's Bank (CFG). Lastly, pharmaceutical developer Eli Lilly (LLY) raises its full-year guidance on the success of its weight-loss and breast cancer drugs. Yahoo Finance Live's Julie Hyman breaks down several of this morning's top headlines.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: UPS shares slump after the delivery giant missed on second quarter revenue and slashed its full-year outlook. Revenue guidance now at around $93 billion this year. That is down from a prior forecast of roughly $97 billion. Much of the hit being put down to the impact of labor negotiations.The UPS and the Teamsters Union reached a tentative deal on a new contract at the end of July. Union members are yet to approve it, however. These results won't come as a huge shock to investors. At the end of April, UPS warned that volume would remain under pressure due to current macro conditions.Moody's has cut its rating on 10 small and mid-sized US banks and warned it could downgrade bigger lenders as well. There were official downgrades for the likes of M&amp;T Bank, Pinnacle, Webster Financial. 11 banks in total were put on a negative outlook including larger lenders like PNC, Capital One and, Citizen's. Those are all falling in premarket trading. Bigger plays like Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp, and State Street are all under review for a potential downgrade.And the good times keep rolling for Eli Lilly. Thanks to a strong drug pipeline, the pharma company upping its full-year guidance after second quarter profit rocketed 85% from a year ago. It now sees full-year revenue landing between $33.4 billion and $33.9 billion, much of the tailwind coming from its type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro which, of course, is also being used off-label for weight reduction and breast cancer pill Verzenio. Shares were up 25% this year, and they've outperformed the wider sector.]"

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Under Armour is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.08 = US$272m ÷ (US$4.9b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Under Armour has an ROCE of 8.0%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Luxury industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for Under Armour roceIn the above chart we have measured Under Armour's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Under Armour.How Are Returns Trending?Under Armour has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 58% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.In Conclusion...To sum it up, Under Armour is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 62% in the last five years. With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Under Armour, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

At the time, the company said it would begin to exit between 2,000 and 3,000 stores in North America and would be in about 10,000 doors by 2022.FN reached out to Under Armour to clarify how much this new wholesale push will change that distribution.The entry into new doors is part of Under Armour’s efforts to lift its sagging U.S. business, which dented its results for the first quarter. Like other footwear brands this quarter, Under Armour’s business in North America was challenged as the region grapples with inventory excesses and conservative orders from wholesale retail partners. Under Armour’s revenue in the region declined 9 percent to $827 million, as part of a broader revenue decline of 2 percent, to $1.3 billion in the first quarter.“There are still inflated levels of inventory that are leading to more promotional activity,” Linnartz said on the call regarding the North American wholesale market. “But as we see the year going on and as we head into next year, we anticipate that things will get better and there will be less need for so much promotional activity.”Story continuesThis recovery, Linnartz said, will be accomplished under the brand’s new Protect This House 3 (PTH 3) plan, a new strategy meant to revamp its business, which involves focusing on reinvigorating brand DNA, key product areas and growing its business in North America. As this strategy progresses, Linnartz said, Under Armour will expand its distribution into new wholesale partners.“As we focus on better product, we’re going to be more disciplined about segmentation. We’re going to open new doors, new partners, including in the wholesale arena,” Linnartz said. “So we’re excited about the long-term strategy and where we’re headed with our partners.”Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic said in a Tuesday note that an entry into new wholesale doors could potentially drive “an inflection domestically” for Under Armour. Other analysts were similarly encouraged by the brand’s potential to recover through the remainder of the year.In the second quarter, Under Armour expects revenue to be between flat and down slightly compared with the prior year, which accounts for a low single-digit decline in North America. Q4 is expected to yield the highest revenue growth rate of the year.Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

The reading pointed to more economic headwinds for the world’s largest oil importer.Brent oil futures fell 0.2% to $86.03 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.2% to $82.76 a barrel by 22:23 ET (02:23 GMT).Crude prices had settled higher after a whipsaw session on Tuesday, as a positive outlook for the U.S. economy helped somewhat offset concerns over slowing economic growth and oil demand in China.The prospect of tighter oil supplies this year, especially following bumper supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, kept prices trading close to four-month highs.But data pointing to an unexpected build in weekly U.S. inventories raised some questions over just how much supplies will tighten in the coming months.Strength in the U.S. dollar, ahead of key inflation data due on Thursday, also weighed on oil prices.Chinese inflation weakens further in JulyChinese consumer price index inflation slid into negative territory for the first time since September 2021, data showed on Wednesday. Producer price index inflation also shrank for a 10th straight month, amid worsening economic conditions in the country.While month-on-month CPI inflation showed some signs of improvement, it was still well below healthy levels, indicating that economic weakness in the world’s largest oil importer was unlikely to improve in the near-term.The soft inflation readings follow data on Tuesday which showed that Chinese oil imports also tumbled through July. This in turn fueled more doubts over a recovery in Chinese oil demand this year.U.S. inventories unexpectedly riseData from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories grew by over 4 million barrels in the week to July 28, much more than expectations for a draw of 0.2 million barrels.Story continuesThe build comes after inventories saw their biggest draw on record in the week to July 21, of over 17 million barrels.But the unexpected build for last week showed that U.S. fuel demand may now be winding down, as the end of the summer season approaches.Official inventory data from the Energy Information Administration is now due later in the day, and is expected to show a draw of 0.2 million barrels.Related ArticlesOil prices dip on surprise U.S. inventory build, weak China inflationGold prices hit 1-mth low, copper sinks as risk-off favors dollarBiden moves to protect vast sacred lands near Grand Canyon]"

The Saudis have pledged to keep up with such cuts through September.Notwithstanding the broader crude stockpile gain it reported for last week, the API cited a slide of 0.112M barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that takes delivery of U.S. crude. In the prior week, the API reported a Cushing deficit of 1.76M barrels.API reports draws for gasoline, distillatesOn the fuels side, API reported a gasoline inventory drop of 0.413M barrels and a distillate stock slide of 2.093M barrels. In the previous week, it noted a 1.68M barrel draw for gasoline and 0.512M deficit for distillates.With the API report out, anticipation builds on what the EIA will cite for last week’s oil supply-demand in the United States, and how that will impact crude prices that have been rallying the past six weeks.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 0.233M barrels, versus the historic 17.049-M barrel plunge reported during the week to July 28.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a build of 0.217M barrels on top of the 1.48M-barrel gain in the previous week.

Optimism over weekly U.S. petroleum balances, due later in the day, also helped the rebound.““The trade data from China was undoubtedly disappointing as it once again showed sluggish demand both domestically and externally, which is consistent with what we've seen elsewhere,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.But Erlam also noted that Saudi production cuts had put a bottom to the market, which ”now looks much tighter”.WTI settled up 98 cents, or 1.2%, at $82.92 per barrel after tumbling below key $80 support earlier, to a session low of $79.94. In the previous session, it closed down 88 cents, or 1.1%.The U.S. crude benchmark gained almost 20% over six previous weeks on the back of Saudi attempts to aggressively slash production. Last week, WTI reached $83.23 last week for its highest since April.Brent settled up 83 cents, or almost 1%, at $86.17, after a session bottom of $83.33. Like WTI, Brent hit three-month highs last week, reaching $86.64, and gaining about 17% over the past six weeks. In Monday’s session, Brent settled down 90 cents, or 1.04%.Overall, Chinese imports contracted by 12.4% in July, far steeper than the expected 5% drop. Exports fell by 14.5%, compared with a fall of 12.5% tipped by economists.Disappointing China data masked by Saudi production cutsOn the oil front, China's crude purchases in July were down 18.8% from the previous month to the lowest daily rate since January, but still up 17% from a year earlier, data showed.Story continues“The economy is quite clearly in need of a boost and I'm just not convinced it's going to come, not in the forceful and widespread manner it has in the past,"" said OANDA’s Erlam. ""Authorities are more likely to engage in smaller, targeted measures that won't provide the confidence boost investors, or households can really get behind. The sluggish recovery looks set to continue.”Outside of China, fuel consumption in India — third-biggest oil importer and consumer after the United States and China, respectively — slipped to a 10-month low in July as monsoon rains restricted mobility, government data showed.Market participants were also on the lookout for U.S. weekly oil inventory data, due after market settlement from API, or the American Petroleum Institute.The API will release at approximately 16:30 ET (20:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended Aug. 4. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 0.233 million barrels, versus the historic 17.049-M barrel plunge reported during the week to July 28.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a build of 0.217M barrels on top of the 1.48M-barrel gain in the previous week.

First, let’s take a look at the global theme parks industry.Global Amusement Parks Industry and Latest Market TrendsIn one of our articles, 15 Best National Parks in Canada, we briefly discussed how the COVID-19 crisis had a devastating impact on Canada’s national parks industry as they suffered due to restrictions on international travel and tourism. The COVID-19 crisis had a similar impact on the global amusement parks industry. The outbreak of the pandemic caused governments around the world to impose lockdowns and restrict international as well as domestic traveling. As a result, this caused a huge fall in the need for services offered by amusement and theme parks.However, as lockdowns and closures of recreational facilities have eased down, it is expected that the amusement parks market will now recover and grow. According to Research and Markets, the global amusement parks industry was valued at $51.6 billion in 2022. Looking forward, the global amusement parks industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.91% during 2022-2028, reaching $68.8 billion by the end of the forecasted period. As recreational and entertainment spaces, amusement parks seem to be benefitting from the increasing rate of urbanization. Offering a variety of amusement facilities, including rides, arcades, casinos, hotels, resorts, water parks, and refreshment zones, these amusement parks attract all kinds of visitors. Some amusement parks around the world now also offer immersive cinematic experiences as well as theatrical plays that are appreciated by both adults and children alike. Moreover, the significant growth in the travel and tourism industry is one of the key factors creating a positive outlook for the global amusement parks market.Story continuesOn July 27, Reuters reported that Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) benefited from higher theme park attendance and the successful theatrical releases of ""The Super Mario Bros Movie"" and ""Fast X"". It is worth noting that Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) previously had to shut down their theme parks and movie theaters as well as lay off a number of their employees in 2020 during the peak of COVID-19 crisis.On July 27, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.13, surpassing EPS estimates by $0.15. The company reported a revenue of $30.51 billion and outperformed revenue estimates by $368.57 million.What are Some of the Biggest Companies in the Amusement Parks Industry Up To?The Amusement Parks industry is relatively fragmented. Some of the top companies include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Universal Studios Theme Parks (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Cedar Fair, L.P. (NYSE:FUN), and Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (NYSE:SIX). With the advancements in technology as well as social media marketing, and the consumers looking forward to a more fun and personalized experience, the competition within the amusement parks industry is tougher than ever.Moreover, factors such as increased adoption of technologically advanced solutions in the form of motion simulators, hydraulics, animatronics, and pneumatics combined with the focus on improving customers’ experience is expected to further augment market growth. Introduction of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology at amusement and theme parks is also expected to help drive the market demand up in the coming years.On May 4, Forbes reported that theme parks like Universal Studios (NASDAQ:CMCSA) are using a combination of AR and VR to create magical experiences for guests. At Universal Studios Theme Parks (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in Japan, one of the most famous and in demand rides is “Mario Kart: Koopa’s Challenge”. This ride takes place inside a replica of Bowser's Castle and at the entrance customers get to put on Mario’s iconic red cap, as well as an augmented reality headset attached to the cap. The customers then experience a physical ride that is merged with digital elements. For example, customers can shoot targets by looking at them through the AR headset and can also compete with other guests as they're playing the game. Universal Studios Theme Parks (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is entering the metaverse, leaving us wondering what the future of theme parks could look like.As the competition now continues to grow, amusement and theme parks are now updating their services in order to keep up with the ever-evolving expectations of teens as well as of the adults. On June 3, The Wall Street Journal reported that Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (NYSE:SIX) in their San Antonio park, Six Flags Fiesta Texas, has refurbished rides as well as a tame roller coaster called Boomerang. The new management also added thousands of plants and trees, hundreds of new tables, as well as more shade and fans for customers waiting in line for rides. The more pleasant atmosphere can help the park expand beyond its longtime customer base and bring in more families, increasing the overall attendance and spending. Increasing investments in themed amusement parks and their rides, including roller coasters, are expected to drive the market further.Now that we have discussed some recent developments in the theme parks and amusement parks industry, let's take a look at some of the tallest rollercoasters in the US in 2023.15 Tallest Roller Coasters in the US in 2023Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyIn this article, we have listed the 15 tallest roller coasters in the US in 2023 in terms of height. To collect data for our list, we used various sources including USA by NUMBERS, CabinZero, Roller Coaster DataBase, and Roller Coaster Wiki. For our list of 15 tallest roller coasters in America, we excluded roller coasters that are currently not operational or have been closed permanently. In addition to these websites, we also consulted many more lists on the internet to cross check claims as to the activity status and the height of all the roller coasters in the US before narrowing down our selection to the 15 tallest roller coasters in the country. The list below is in ascending order, from the shortest to the tallest.15 Tallest Roller Coasters in the US in 202315. Wild EagleHeight: 210 feetFirst up on our list of 15 tallest roller coasters in America is Wide Eagle with a height of 210 feet. It was built by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard and is located at the Dollywood amusement park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The roller coaster has a drop of 135 feet and takes riders through loops as well as a zero-gravity roll where they experience the feeling of weightlessness.Some of the top amusement parks stocks to invest in include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Cedar Fair, L.P. (NYSE:FUN), and Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (NYSE:SIX).14. CandymoniumHeight: 210 feetManufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, Candymonium is one of the tallest roller coasters in the US as of 2023 as it stands at 210 feet at the Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania. With a drop of 216 feet, it is the fastest as well as the tallest and longest roller coaster at Hersheypark. 13. Mr. Freeze: Reverse BlastHeight: 218 feetInspired by the Batman villain Mr.Freeze, there are two Mr. Freeze : Reverse Blast named roller coasters in the US. The first host is the Six Flags Over Texas Park in Arlington, Texas, and the second location is at the Six Flags St. Louis in Eureka, Missouri. Both the roller coasters were manufactured by Premier Rides Inc. and are completely identical with the same maximum height of 218 feet.12. ValravnHeight: 223 feetManufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, Valravn is a 223 feet high roller coaster at Cedar Point in Ohio, US. Full of dramatic drops and loops, it is a one-of-a-kind Dive roller coaster. It holds several Dive roller coaster records for being the fastest, longest and tallest at different intervals in its history.12: NitroHeight: 230 feetThe Nitro roller coaster with a maximum height of around 230 feet and a drop of 215 feet, offers a stirring ride full of many hills, sharp u-turns, and a hammerhead turn. It has a streamlined and slim seating design which makes the long duration of the roller coaster all the more enjoyable. Nitro was also manufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard and is located in the Six Flags Great Adventure Park in Jackson Township, New Jersey.11. DiamondbackHeight: 230 feetThe Diamondback roller coaster is located at Kings Island Park in Mason, Ohio. This 230 feet high roller coaster with a drop of 215 feet was manufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard. Its most unique feature is the staggered seating which offers each rider an eagle's eye view during the entire ride. It has a long duration and ends with a bang as the ride goes through a splashdown towards the end.10. IntimidatorHeight: 232 feetManufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, Intimidator is located in the Carowinds Park in Charlotte, North Carolina. With a height of 232 feet, Intimidator is one of the tallest roller coasters in America. Its main feature would be the seven camel-back hills which represent the number of championships of Earnhardt, the speedracer it has been named after. Moreover, it has eight drops and one stimulating spiral.8. GoliathHeight: 235 feetGoliath was manufactured by Giovanola and is located at the Six Flags Magic Mountain Park in Valencia, California. After an unnecessary mid-course trim brake, the only action-packed part of riding the Goliath is the helix that can be riveted due to the roller coaster's 235 feet height.7. TitanHeight: 245 feetTitan, also manufactured by Giovanola, is located in Six Flags Over Texas Park in Arlington, Texas. Titan and Goliath, two of the roller coasters that rank among the tallest roller coasters in the US in 2023, look quite similar to each other. While Titan’s 245 feet height and two 540-degree spirals can be overwhelming, its mid-course and the overall ride is reported to be underwhelming with no climaxes.6. OrionHeight: 287 feetYet another roller coaster manufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, Orion is quite an intimidating ride due to the main spiral during the ride, known as the ‘Orion Belt’, which often causes blackouts for its riders. Interestingly, while its average height is 287 feet, its drop is even higher at 300 feet. This is because its drop takes the ride even below ground level. Orion is located at Kings Island Park in Mason, Ohio.Some of the most popular amusement parks and theme parks are owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Cedar Fair, L.P. (NYSE:FUN), and Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (NYSE:SIX).Click to continue reading and see the 5 Tallest Roller Coasters in the US in 2023.Suggested Articles:10 Oversold Tech Stocks to Buy15 Countries with the Most IKEA Stores Worldwide in 202310 Best Sectors To Invest In Long-TermDisclosure: None. 15 Tallest Roller Coasters in the US in 2023 is published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:PRU) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 60% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-nyse-pru-140100512.html,1691503260,STORY,['PRU'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Prudential Financial's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions40% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyEvery investor in Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 60% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Prudential Financial, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Prudential Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Prudential Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Prudential Financial is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.1% and 4.6% of the stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Prudential Financial, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$62m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 40% stake in Prudential Financial. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

It's the most significant decline since the commercial real estate research firm started tracking rates in 2013.There are currently around 50,000 self-storage facilities in the U.S. and more than 1 in 10 households rent a facility, with 70% used by residential customers, according to a U.S. Self Storage Industry Statistics report released at the end of January.The summer months, typically a peak storage demand season, have seen new customer rents drop 8% lower than in the second quarter of 2022, Green Street senior analyst Spenser Allaway told The Wall Street Journal. The Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) Nareit Equity Self Storage index has also fallen more than 20% since the end of 2021, reflecting weakening demand, rent and occupancy.Bloomberg reported this week that even Blackstone Inc.'s (NYSE:BX) $68 billion real estate trust felt the need to sell its Simply Self Storage to Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) for $2.2 billion as the property vehicle was dealing with investor withdrawals and upheaval in the commercial property sector.Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR) missed the Zacks Investment Research consensus estimate of $2.12 per share by 6 cents and is down from $2.13  per share a year ago. Extra Space Storage shares have lost about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.6%. The WSJ reported last weekend that Public Storage is offering incentives to new renters, including charging only $1 for the first month's rent.Story continuesExtra Space CEO Joe Margolis said that while his facilities remain nearly full, post-pandemic rates continue to drop, and this summer, so far, has been disappointing.""We maintained strong occupancy of 94.5%, driving same-store revenue growth of 2.7% in the quarter, despite exceptionally difficult year-over-year comparables from pandemic highs,"" he said. ""We have revised our outlook for the back half of the year due to lower-than-expected new customer rates in June and July.""Check out:Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.A REIT you've probably never heard of is up 36% over the past two years.

To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks That Will Benefit From AI.Market Slowdown In AugustAugust has been off to a slow start for most stocks. On August 8, the S&amp;P 500 healthcare sector was the only sector in the green, while 10 remaining sectors were all down - even tech. Healthcare was up by 6.08 basis points or 0.38%, while tech was down by 41.45 basis points or 1.36%. While some observers are seeing this slow market activity as a sign that the bull market many were welcoming did not even start, others believe the only reasons behind the downward trend in stocks this month are high valuations and summer seasonal issues.At a time like this, most investors would be tempted to hold off on the buying spree and wait for stocks to settle down before they swoop in. However, buying up stellar stocks, most notably artificial intelligence-related or technology stocks, right now when they seem to be down may be a strategy worth considering. Companies that have been working tirelessly to keep up with their competitors in the artificial intelligence arms race are in the red today, but there's no telling how long they'll stay there. For instance, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) are three stocks that were down by 3.34%, 2.54%, and 0.41%, respectively, on August 8. These are companies that have been contributing to the artificial intelligence space this year, whether in the realm of generative AI or the provision of essential AI-related semiconductor chips, among more. Despite this, they are taking a beating alongside many other tech and AI stocks that analysts and investors are bullish on to this day.Considering the way artificial intelligence has revolutionized the tech industry and the world, in general, this year, particularly with the advent of ChatGPT and other generative AI products, it's far too soon to write off the companies that are working in this space. It's likely that companies working with AI this year will profit immensely in the near future, which will ensure that their shareholders will profit just as much when the time to reap the benefits of their hard work finally rolls around. Considering this, we have compiled a list of such top stocks that will benefit from AI this year. They include some of the best AI stocks to buy now alongside other tech stocks that are introducing new AI products and services as part of their suite of products.Story continuesStocks That Will Benefit From AIOur MethodologyWe have selected companies that have been actively investing and innovating in the AI space this year and have mentioned their specific contributions to the sector below. The companies are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge fund investors. We used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter to rank them.Stocks That Will Benefit From AI12. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is an application software company offering a platform that enables customers to design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI applications. It is based in Redwood City, California. As a pure-play AI company in the market, it is likely to benefit immensely from the AI boom.As of July 24, Joe Goodwin, an analyst at JMP Securities, maintains an Outperform rating on shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). He also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $38 to $40.At the end of the first quarter, 24 hedge funds held stakes in C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), with a total stake value of $151.9 million.In its March 2023 investor letter, Kerrisdale Capital said the following about C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI):“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)11.

(NASDAQ:BIDU) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Many, if not most, stocks held in the Funds’ portfolios performed quite well in the first quarter. This was particularly true for the Funds’ non-US equity holdings, many of which have come into their own over the last two quarters, despite years of underperformance versus their US counterparts – a welcome shift given that our Funds’ portfolios have been somewhat non-US-centric in terms of their portfolio allocations for well over a decade. The Funds also received a long overdue boost from their Chinese and Hong Kong-based holdings in the wake of China’s reopening and the government’s signaling of a relaxation of their interventionist policies. This included strong returns in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) among others.”10. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Chris Caso, an analyst at Wolfe Research, initiated coverage on Micron Technology Inc.

Adobe has had several cross-currents this year with slightly slower revenue growth, the announcement of a sizeable potential acquisition of Figma, and the introduction of generative AI functionality into many of its products. These issues seem to be a net positive, although we are cautious about the company’s ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Figma acquisition.

EFX.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2133601/5-financial-transaction-stocks-in-focus-amid-steady-consumer-spendingThe Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from expanding transaction volumes resulting from the widespread adoption of digital means. An advanced digital solutions suite, built on mergers and acquisitions as well as tech investments, equips players to capitalize on a booming digital era. Signs of subsiding inflation might pave the way for increased consumer spending in the days ahead.Recovery in travel is likely to drive cross-border volumes. Companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and Equifax Inc. are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe, facilitating the switching of transactions and permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryA Booming Digital Environment: The pandemic made people aware of the hassle-free and affordable nature of contactless payments. Even after the pandemic receded, the digitization trend showed no sign of slowing down across the globe. A higher Internet penetration rate and increased usage of smartphones contribute to the increased uptake of digital payments.In light of the prevailing scenario, it has become inevitable to build an enhanced contactless payments suite or upgrade the existing ones. For this, financial transaction services players have to often resort to technology investments that might escalate costs for them. However, owing to the long-term benefits that such investments provide, the industry players have come up with diversified contactless payment options such as mobile wallets, biometrics and QR codes.Such initiatives will enable the players to solidify their presence in the global digital payments market, boost their customer base and diversify income streams. To counter the growing number of cybercrimes that are often associated with online payments, industry participants remain equipped with fraud prevention solutions.Steady Rise in Consumer Spending: Improved consumer spending implies greater utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction services players. This, in turn, offers an opportunity for industry players to process higher transaction volumes. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market add to the purchasing power of consumers and subsiding inflationary headwinds boost hopes for continually rising consumer spending in the days ahead.Also, the ease with which e-commerce shopping can be done within the comfort of one’s home is likely to provide an impetus to growth in consumer spending. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in the January-June 2023 period, consumer spending in each of the months has witnessed an uptick sequentially.Improved Cross-Border Volumes: Increased travel, whether for business or recreation, will likely boost cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. With industrial and business activities back on track, the demand for international travel is likely to remain steady in the days ahead. Industry participants often come up with efficient business travel solutions that make flight bookings simpler. The ease of digital payments transcends the barrier between borders. Platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise aid in the seamless processing of digital payments.A Prudent M&amp;A Strategy: In addition to tech investments, a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy often becomes the means for building an efficient digital suite. The strategy also gives an opportunity to financial transaction services players to foray into new markets, expand their foothold in existing ones, broaden partner networks and increase customer base. However, interest rate hikes by the Fed to tame inflation result in higher borrowing costs.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

During the three days together, they discussed important topics related to unlocking inclusive, heart-led, high-performance and transformational growth including learning and development, mentorship, people planning, and equity, inclusion and belonging. But the largest focus of the week was social purpose - feeding people's potential around the world.KFC has long been a purpose-driven business. Today more than ever, our ambition is for purpose to be the the center of everything we do - the food we serve, the people we employ and the communities we're a part of.Feeding People's Potential through foodTo experience the impact of this work firsthand, the KFC UK&amp;I team welcomed our global People, Culture and Purpose leaders into their kitchens and demonstrated how they work to deliver surplus food from KFC restaurants to people in need while preventing it from going to waste. The team then visited charity partners who help distribute our surplus food and learned more about the people it helps feed.Feeding People's Potential through skills and opportunitiesThe team also got to meet Liam, a KFC team member and graduate of KFC UK&amp;I's Hatch program. Hatch is a social purpose program designed to offer on-the-job training and life skills to help enable youth to increase their employability. Prior to Hatch, Liam described himself as lacking confidence and struggled to successfully engage in the first couple of workplaces he tried. Participating in Hatch changed Liam's trajectory. Not only did he gain valuable skills and experience, but his confidence also grew exponentially and he's ready to take on any challenge.Celebrating our Communities of BelongingEarlier this year, we launched two global Communities of Belonging (CoB)- SHINE, designed to empowering women throughout our KFC family, and Kentucky Fried Pride, dedicated to supporting and celebrating the LQBTQIA+ community and its allies. At the CPO conference, we popped bottles of champagne and raised a toast to the impact these communities have had in such a short time, globally and locally.Story continuesCelebrating our achievementsThe conference wrapped up with an evening of awards recognizing the amazing hard work our People, Culture and Purpose teams have accomplished through heart-led leadership, courageous coaching and a winning mindset.Yum!

After contract negotiations this summer, full-time drivers for UPS saw their salaries boosted from $145,000 to $170,000 annually including benefits, according to data shared by the shipping company on a recent call.While not everyone is winning as much as these UPS workers, this represents a symbolic triumph for unions, the middle class and the labor-friendly White House (excluding German Shepherds, in the case of Joe Biden’s noshing pet, “Champ”), as it’s a testament to collective efforts to boost the middle class for the first time in a generation—or two. The public has noticed—jobs site Indeed reported a 50% surge in searches for “UPS” or “United Parcel Service” within a week of the new contract, Bloomberg reported.Biden’s famous adoration of ice cream has really only been paralleled or eclipsed by his love for this middle class. His campaign premise to revive the average American quickly led to a new word: Bidenomics, a portmanteau (much like Obamanomics, Reaganomics before, or Hobama as of late), that refers to, in Biden’s own words: “building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.”In that vein, Biden hasn’t just been governing in opposition to his former opponent President Trump, but also the Republican hero Ronald Reagan, the onetime union leader during the last Hollywood dual strike who decades later slashed taxes for the wealthy as part of what became known as trickle-down economics. Tax breaks to the rich helped the rich, of course, but data has progressively mounted that they didn’t help the middle class whose wages stagnated for decades, barely keeping pace with inflation.Now it’s Biden’s turn at the wheel, and drivers are getting paid famously. Rather than building from the top down, Joe’s strategy of bottom up and middle out, which can be seen in his push to invest in manufacturing jobs and record-breaking wage growth for those in historically lower-compensated positions. Of course, this doesn't come without accusations from the now neglected rich, which was faring quite well the last time fanny packs were big. The waning glory days of the wealthy is deemed the “richcession,” where the economy may be growing overall but just doesn’t feel so good anymore for those at the upper echelon. Those with six-figure incomes sometimes report feeling like they need more to be financially comfortable, and even if they’ve continued to win the economy by nature of their riches, they sometimes feel anxious—but that dog won’t hunt these days.Story continuesBiden and unions deliver on their promiseThe largest union in the nation, Teamsters, recently bargained for a historical contract on behalf of UPS. While not every worker is getting that hefty salary, part-time workers also won a pay raise of around $21 hourly, and employees were finally able to have better conditions like air conditioning. “This contract sets a new standard in the labor movement and raises the bar for all workers,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien in a statement.This UPS victory might be the clearest sign yet that Biden’s plan to invest heavily in the middle and lower class has a real-life impact on wage gains. But the success is not Biden’s alone, rather it’s also a signal regarding the influence of a strong union backing. Threatening to strike if their demands were not met, the increasingly consumer-dependent America could not stand to be without its millions of packages every month.To be sure, one historic contract does not by itself correct the long-term trend against union membership—or a middle class shrinking for decades. Despite increasingly favorable sentiment for unions, actual union membership is the lowest on record. But it does show that unions can get the job done, and signals to vulnerable, oft-unionized workers in white-collar fields that protections can get them the benefits they are looking for.But there is reason to believe in a turning of the tide. The hottest summer in 100,000 years has also been named the summer of strikes, as multiple unions in the entertainment world have joined the fight for better wages (and A.I. regulations). Next up could be a historic triple strike in Detroit as the United Auto Workers, a historic union that has brand-new leadership after a series of scandals, is determined to win a new contract from the Big Three automakers..While UPS projects low revenue this quarter, their new salary for workers has attracted many workers. Blue-collar jobs have recently struggled to attract Gen Z employees and others due to poor working conditions and a lack of fair pay. The future for the middle class may have arrived at America’s doorstep, and they wear brown shorts and sometimes spar with your dog while bringing you the package you’ve been waiting for.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Tomé, UPS CEO, told analysts Tuesday that she expects by year’s end to win back all of the business and to close deals on lost sales, though the company’s efforts will take some time. “It’s all hands on deck” to recover diverted volumes and push about $7 billion in potential sales through the pipeline, she said. “We are already seeing some volume return,” she said, without elaborating.UPS (NYSE: UPS) has set up a “control tower” operation whose mission is to win back business without it leading to service disruptions, Tomé said.Average daily volume in UPS’ domestic segment, its largest, dropped 9.9% in the second quarter, compared to the 2022 period. There was more parcel diversion in July than the company expected, though the losses weren’t as severe as in June. UPS said it expects that by the end of 2023 it will return average daily volumes to even with December 2022 levels. For the second half of 2023, it expects average daily volumes to be down by single-digit percentages year over year.According to the company, the diverted business was split evenly, with one-third each going to FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX), the U.S. Postal Service and regional delivery carriers.UPS’ U.S. average daily volume in the quarter totaled 17.4 million parcels, according to ShipMatrix, a consultancy. Domestic and international volume combined totaled 20.9 million daily parcels, the firm said.The company expects wages and benefits to rise by 3.3%, compounded annually, over the life of the contract. The bulk of the increases will occur in the first year, because the Teamsters wanted a front-loaded bump to offset current inflation levels, UPS said. The first-year increases, which will average $2.75 an hour for full- and part-timers, were higher than planned, UPS said. The fifth year will be the second-highest-cost year, with smaller increases in years two through four.Story continuesTomé would not specify what level of general rate increase will be imposed for 2024 to recoup the higher labor costs.A tentative five-year agreement was reached July 25, heading off a potential Aug. 1 strike. The 340,000 UPS Teamsters have until Aug. 22 to ratify or reject the agreement. Officials representing 162 UPS Teamster locals have unanimously endorsed the contract.Amit Mehrotra, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the comments on the call reaffirmed his belief that UPS should be able to manage the increased costs per package resulting from the labor agreement. He has a $212-per-share 12-month price target. Less sanguine was Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI, who said UPS’ formidable cost-management efforts and expected price increases will not offset the headwinds over the next few quarters from the higher labor costs. He has a $185-a-share price target, down from $187. After a rocky start to the day, UPS shares recovered much of their early losses. It closed at it traded at $180.59 a share, down $1.56 per share.Management’s comments come on the heels of a difficult second quarter and lowered expectations for the full year. Full-year revenue is expected to be $93 billion in 2023, down from the prior forecast of $97 billion, UPS (NYSE: UPS) said in a statement. It now expects an adjusted operating margin this year of 11.8%, compared with an earlier forecast of 12.8%.In the second quarter, revenue came in at $22.1 billion, compared to $24.4 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Operating profit of $2.8 billion was down 18.4%, on an adjusted basis, from the same period a year ago. Adjusted operating margin was reported at 13.2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.54 was slightly above consensus estimates of $2.50.UPS said the guidance change was “primarily to reflect the volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement” that was reached on July 25. The stock fell 5.6% in U.S. trading before exchanges opened.Second-quarter revenue for the company’s domestic segment, its largest, fell to $14.3 billion from $15.4 billion, while adjusted operating profit dropped to $1.85 billion from $1.68 billion. Average daily volume fell 6.9% year over year.The international segment posted revenue of $4.4 billion in revenue, down from $5.07 billion, driven by a 6.6% drop in average daily volume. Adjusted operating profit fell to $902 million from $1.2 billion.UPS’ Supply Chain Solutions unit, which includes all its nonpackage business, reported a 23.4% drop in revenue to $3.2 billion as rate and volume declines in freight forwarding more than offset growth in its health care logistics business. Adjusted operating profit came in at $336 million, down from $517 million in the 2022 quarter.Domestically, the company experienced lower volumes across all verticals. Business-to-consumer volume fell 11.1%, while business-to-business volume dropped 8%. Customers continued to trade down from air to lower-cost ground services. Average daily air volume fell 16% year over year.At the same time, the U.S. business reduced costs in the quarter by $889 million, the largest year-over-year expense reductions in UPS’ history.While the U.S. macro environment came in as UPS expected, the international climate was worse than expected. Economic conditions in Asia, which were in slow-recovery mode in the first quarter, stalled out in the second. Activity in Europe was hampered by weak demand and high inflation, the company said. The one bright spot — in relative terms — was China, where a decline of 7% was an improvement over the first quarter.Overall, the fourth quarter looks brighter than the third, due in part to peak seasonality, the company said.The post UPS suffered larger-than-expected shipment losses due to labor concerns appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

This informs our strategy and actions to support the resilience of the business.We take a rigorous approach to identifying and managing our climate risks, in line with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). This enables us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, and to sharpen and enhance how we can mitigate climate risks.TCFD provides voluntary climate-related financial disclosure recommendations designed to help companies support informed capital allocation decisions and provide better and consistent information to stakeholders. This includes a framework for companies to assess climate-related risks and opportunities through the use of climate scenario analysis and guidance on reporting strategies and actions to mitigate risks. The disclosure recommendations are structured around four thematic areas: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets.We strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues following the TCFD recommendations. See our TCFD index for references to our CDP response and portions of this report on how we address the eleven recommendations of TCFD.Identifying and Assessing Climate RiskClimate risk management is driven by our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks. We have a Risk and Compliance Committee (MRCC), co-led by our SVP &amp; Chief Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer (Chief Compliance Officer) and SVP, Chief Audit &amp; Controls Officer (Chief Audit &amp; Controls Officer) and composed of leaders from the Finance, Accounting, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit and People functions. The MRCC provides broad oversight of our enterprise risks and ERM process. The MRCC meets regularly and, through consultation with senior leaders and other managers with subject matter expertise, periodically assesses the key risks facing the Company, works with those risk owners responsible for managing each specific risk, and reviews mitigation actions and the status of the annual enterprise risk assessment. Our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Audit &amp; Controls Officer regularly report to the Audit Committee to provide updates on the status of the ERM process, which the Audit Committee Chair reports to the full Board. Similar risk and compliance committees exist on regional and local levels.Story continuesThe identification of emerging climate risks is informed by external scans of megatrends, consultancy and industry reports, peer CDP disclosures, TCFD reports, annual reports and 10-Ks. For new and emerging climate risks, relevant internal stakeholders are engaged to review and rank the identified risks based on magnitude of potential impact and Mondelēz International strategic priorities.Annually, we use tools and third-party consultants to assess the potential financial impact of climate risk in the short-term, medium-term and long-term horizons. We also conduct frequent quantitative scenario analysis to understand the future-scenario based financial impact of climate risk. We supplement the analysis with ongoing site-level engineering assessments to consider plant-level exposures, taking into consideration risk mitigation measures already in place.The MRCC assigns ownership of specific risks to the Mondelēz Leadership Team. As owners of each specific risk, Mondelēz Leadership Team members are responsible for overseeing that appropriate mitigation controls, monitoring and response systems are in place. With support from the global ERM team, Mondelēz International develops a robust risk assessment, prioritization, and mitigation plan. This plan is based on our ERM risk rating criteria which includes risk impact, velocity, likelihood and management preparedness. The risks are then added to a global risk register, which is used to monitor all enterprise risks.Managing, Mitigating and Monitoring RiskThe management and monitoring of risks, including climate risks, is reviewed annually by the global ERM team, while the implementation of mitigation plans and the monitoring of risk KPIs are ongoing at the global, regional or business level, where required. Based on the specific risk drivers and prioritization, we develop and implement our risk response strategies, which can be either mitigation (action plans), transfer (insurance), avoidance, or acceptance. We monitor performance against our risk response strategies using risk KPIs that are tracked by the respective risk owner and reported to the global ERM team.The global ERM team is enhancing the integration of climate risk management into the overall ERM strategy and process.Action Toward Net ZeroWe are taking concerted, coordinated action to play our part in combating climate change - working toward our long-term ambition of net zero carbon and resilient landscapes.

Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and softwareSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.comOne of the A-rated stocks I remain bullish on is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and with good reason. The semiconductor stock is up nearly 220% this year, and there’s no sign that the run is close to being over.The most significant tailwind is Nvidia’s role in the growth of generative artificial intelligence. Nvidia owns a commanding market share of 80% to 95% in the AI computing market. Nothing is hotter than generative AI on Wall Street today.OpenAI ignited a firestorm when it rolled out ChatGPT late last year, but now any computing company worth its salt is working on building out generative AI applications.Even though other semiconductor companies are working to close the gap, analysts believe Nvidia will continue dominating the market through at least 2027.Earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 included revenue of $7.19 billion and earnings of 82 cents per share.

319,8127dbca-a90c-391d-a738-3f9df2dabcee,OXY,2023-08-09,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-occidental-petroleum-140103302.html,1691503263,STORY,['OXY'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Occidental Petroleum is US$69.84 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$63.90 suggests Occidental Petroleum is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$66.13 analyst price target for OXY is 5.3% less than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.08bUS$5.19bUS$5.48bUS$5.64bUS$5.60bUS$5.61bUS$5.65bUS$5.72bUS$5.80bUS$5.90bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ -0.65%Est @ 0.18%Est @ 0.76%Est @ 1.16%Est @ 1.45%Est @ 1.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$5.5kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$3.8kUS$3.4kUS$3.1kUS$2.8kUS$2.6kUS$2.4kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$34bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$73bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$73b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$28bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$62b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$63.9, the company appears about fair value at a 8.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.381. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Occidental PetroleumStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Occidental Petroleum, there are three further aspects you should explore:Risks: For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does OXY's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The new system, which is indicated for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), features the POLARx FIT Cryoablation Balloon Catheter, a device with the unique capability of enabling two balloon sizes – 28 and 31mm – in one catheter.Boston Scientific Corporation (PRNewsFoto/Boston Scientific Corporation) (PRNewsFoto/Boston Scientific Corporation)Cryoablation is a minimally invasive procedure for treating AF during which a balloon catheter delivers cryotherapy to the pulmonary vein, freezing problematic tissue and creating scarring that blocks irregular electrical signals. The system addresses known limitations by reimagining existing cryoablation offerings, allowing physicians to adjust and expand the new POLARx FIT catheter to fit a patient's individual anatomy during an ablation procedure, which can help mitigate time-consuming and disruptive device changeouts. The device also allows physicians to treat a wider range of pulmonary vein anatomies and create lesions in optimal positions to better deliver therapy to areas of the heart where disruptive signals that cause AF originate.""The new POLARx Cryoablation System, and the expandable cryoballoon catheter specifically, is an exciting development for the effective treatment of AF as it allows physicians to better tailor care for individual patients without sacrificing safety or efficiency,"" said Wilber Su, MD, FHRS, FACC, Director of Electrophysiology, Banner University. ""As we saw in clinical evaluation, the combination of maneuverability and variable balloon sizes makes this system particularly useful in addressing longstanding challenges with varying cardiac anatomies and brings to the table occlusion capabilities physicians aren't used to seeing with traditional systems.""Story continuesData from the FROZEN-AF IDE clinical trial – a global, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm study presented at Heart Rhythm 2023 – demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the POLARx Cryoablation System for the treatment of 385 patients with paroxysmal AF. The primary event-free rate, or freedom from procedure- or device-related events, was 96.0% at 12 months, with no reports of moderate or severe pulmonary vein stenosis, persistent phrenic nerve palsy or esophageal fistulas. At 12 months, the rate of freedom from documented atrial arrhythmias was 79.9%.""The U.S. approval of the POLARx Cryoablation System, which has been used in more than 25,000 patients worldwide to date, marks an exciting advancement for the treatment of AF and a new era of cryoablation capabilities,"" said Nick Spadea-Anello, president, Electrophysiology, Boston Scientific. ""By prioritizing procedural flexibility and individualized care, this offering transforms a key therapy in the electrophysiology space, addresses the unmet needs of physicians and affirms our commitment to making meaningful innovations to established technologies.""The POLARx Cryoablation System received CE Mark in February of 2020 and Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) approval in October of 2021. The POLARx FIT catheter received approval in Europe, Japan, Canada and other Asia Pacific markets in 2023.More information on the POLARx Cryoablation System is available here.About Boston ScientificBoston Scientific transforms lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world.

The rating agency also downgraded its outlook to negative from stable for 11 other banks.The 10 banks whose debt ratings were slashed by Moody’s include M&amp;T Bank, Associated Banc-Corp, Webster Financial, Prosperity Bancshares, Inc. and BOK Financial. Further, the ratings outlook of Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Northern Trust, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. and Truist Financial have been placed under review for downgrade.Capital One, Citizens Financial, Fifth Third Bancorp, Bank OZK, PNC Financial and Regions Financial are some big names whose outlook was lowered by Moody’s to negative on Monday.The rating agency noted that rising funding costs, potential regulatory capital weakness and heightened risks associated with commercial real estate (CRE) loans on subdued office space demand are putting strain on banks’ profitability.In a note, Moody’s stated, “Many banks' second-quarter results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”Story continuesThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March sparked a regional banking crisis, leading to deposit flight despite regulators’ emergency actions to shore up confidence. The rating agency warns that the current high interest rate environment has made many banks with substantial unrealized losses not reflected in their regulatory capital ratios vulnerable to a loss of confidence.The Federal Reserve increased the interest rates at the fastest pace in decades to contain stubborn inflation, which has slowed down credit demand. Also, a recent Federal Reserve survey data noted that the U.S. banks reported tighter credit standards and muted wholesale and retail loan demand during the second quarter.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Welcome to Nuwellis's second-quarter 2023 earnings conference call.I would like to begin today's call with a recap of the press release that we issued this morning, announcing our CFO transition. Effective September 1, Lynn Blake will step down from her role as CFO. We sincerely thank Lynn for her contributions to Nuwellis. Her positive impact would be felt long after her departure. Lynn has agreed to consult with the company through March 31, 2024, to ensure a seamless transition.Rob Scott, our current Senior Finance Director, will be appointed as Lynn's successor. Rob has been with the company over 10 years and have -- I'm outmost confident in his ability to lead the finance organization to the company's next finance -- excuse me, next phase of growth. Rob has very deep knowledge of the business, and I look forward to working with him on the leadership team.In the same vein, I would like to extend a warm welcome to our newest Board member, Mike McCormick, who joined Nuwellis in June. His extensive experience as an executive in the medical technology field would be of great value to the Board, me, and our entire organization. Welcome, Mike.Turning to our earnings agenda. On today's call, I would provide an overview of our second-quarter performance and would give an update on our strategic initiatives. I will also discuss our recent announced supply and collaboration agreement with DaVita, and Dr. John Jefferies, our Chief Medical Officer, will add his perspective on the DaVita collaboration as well. Our Chief Financial Officer, Lynn Blake, will then provide detailed commentary on the financial results before opening the call up for questions followed by my closing remarks.Turning to our second-quarter results. In the second quarter of 2023, Nuwellis generated $2.1 million in revenue, a 6% decline versus the second quarter of 2022 and a 14% increase over the prior quarter. Utilization, or the number of circuits per console sold, increased 14% over the same period last year, reflecting an increase in the number of patients treated with the Aquadex therapy, offset by a decrease in sales of consoles. We have observed similar macroeconomic conditions with other medtech companies that have announced growth in treatment procedures, but lingering capital constraints in many hospital accounts.By segment, we are pleased to report a rebound of our pediatric business in the second quarter, with sales increasing 72% from the first quarter, reflecting an improvement from the low census we saw in Q1, and continued momentum in our heart failure segment, supported by a growing awareness of our clinical evidence. Second-quarter 2023 revenue in heart failure increased 8% over the same period last year, while critical care and pediatric revenue declined 20% and 5%, respectively.In heart failure, the 8% revenue growth in Q2 follows year-over-year heart failure revenue growth of 21% in Q1 2023. These strong results can be attributed to growing awareness of our clinical data and support from multiple peer-reviewed publications over the past several months, validating the clinical and economic benefits of the Aquadex therapy.We continue to focus on driving awareness among clinicians and providers to help them understand that ultrafiltration is the next logical step in the care pathway. In other words, patients for whom oral or intravenous diuretics are not effective to immediately move to ultrafiltration therapy, which is the mechanical fluid removal solution and, as such, is more controllable, precise, and predictable. This is the message our field organization is now delivering. And based on the heart failure segment revenue results the past two quarters, the message is having a positive result as demonstrated by increased sales of disposable circuits.Now I would like to provide additional updates on our top strategic initiatives to help accelerate clinical adoption of our Aquadex ultrafiltration therapy. On June 20, we announced we have entered into a supply and collaboration agreement with DaVita to pilot Aquadex ultrafiltration therapy to treat adult patients with congestive heart failure and related conditions in select US markets. Pairing the Aquadex system with DaVita's care team could expand access to ultrafiltration therapy to many of heart failure patients in the US suffering from fluid overload and reduce related healthcare costs for providers and payers.The planning phase of the pilot program is underway. Nuwellis and DaVita are working together to actively explore sites for selection and develop treatment pathways. Through the pilot, ultrafiltration therapy using Aquadex will be available at certain DaVita hospital customers and outpatient center locations, with both companies collaborating on the rollout of the therapy, clinician training, and patient support.At the conclusion of the pilot, DaVita has the option to extend the supply agreement with Nuwellis for continued provision of ultrafiltration services for inpatients, emergency rooms, observation units, and outpatient facilities for up to 10 years. DaVita's clinical infrastructure could potentially help accelerate the clinical adoption of ultrafiltration when first-line medical treatments are ineffective. Our organization is thrilled and actively collaborating with the DaVita team as we prepare to rollout the therapy.Turning to our product development initiatives. We continue to advance the development of our pediatric continuous renal replacement therapy device and anticipate IDE approval in first half of 2024. This product addresses the unmet need of the pediatric patient population and could significantly increase the quality of life for neonates and small children with kidney malfunction, kidney issues, or those born without kidney, all of whom suffer from life-threatening renal dysfunction. We, along with many big pediatric nephrologists, believe this product would be a game changer for this patient population.I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. John Jefferies, to further discuss our strategic collaboration with DaVita. John?John JefferiesThank you, Nestor, and good morning.We believe there are multiple benefits that will be realized from our collaboration with DaVita. First, the collaboration will increase awareness of the growing number of heart failure patients in the United States. Importantly, this collaboration will improve recognition of a safe and effective therapeutic option in the form of aquaphorisis. Although this therapy has been available for many years, awareness and access continue to be opportunities that are not fully realized.Heart failure continues to increase in incidence and prevalence across all age spectrums. Although frequently targeted by industry for research and development, the collective approach to the treatment of volume overload continues to center on the use of oral and intravenous diuretic therapy. Aquadex offers a more predictable and precise approach to treating this very difficult clinical phenotype.With this collaboration, the opportunity to increase access will most likely result in more utilization of the therapy. In addition, this pilot leverages expertise from cardiovascular medicine and nephrology, which provides a powerful vehicle to enhance our understanding of cardiorenal syndrome.Nestor JaramilloThank you, Dr. Jefferies.Before turning the call over to Lynn, I would like to reaffirm our business fundamentals, financial discipline, and commitment to organizational efficiency. During the quarter, we streamlined our commercial operations to support increased productivity and utilization. We believe our team is now well designed to continue to increase market penetration of our Aquadex ultrafiltration therapy.Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Lynn Blake, to discuss our Q2 financial results.Lynn BlakeThank you, Nestor, and good morning, everyone.Revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $2.1 million, representing a 14% increase over the first quarter of this year and a 6% decline versus the second quarter of 2022. By segment, second-quarter 2023 revenue in heart failure increased approximately 8% over the same period last year, while critical care and pediatrics revenues declined approximately 20% and 5%, respectively.As noted earlier, pediatrics revenue increased 72% over the first quarter of 2023, as we saw pediatric census rebound by the end of the second quarter. And as Nestor mentioned, 14% more patients were treated with the Aquadex therapy than in the same period last year.Gross margin for the quarter was 55.3% of sales, an increase of 730 basis points compared to gross margin of 48% in the prior quarter -- prior year quarter, driven by a combination of favorable sales mix as well as a $100,000 non-cash inventory write-off in the prior year period related to the discontinuation of a distribution agreement.Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $4.7 million in the second quarter of 2023. Compared to the second quarter of 2022, SG&amp;A expenses increased by approximately $400,000. This increase primarily reflects increased legal, audit, and other professional fees in the current quarter.Second-quarter R&amp;D expenses was $1.5 million, an increase of $400,000 compared to the second quarter of 2022. This increase reflects higher spend on our new pediatrics CRRT device as we ramp up development and preparations for IDE submission in the first quarter of 2024.Total operating expenses were $6.2 million in the quarter, an increase of approximately 15% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Sequentially, total operating expenses decreased about 11%, primarily due to reduced professional fees and lower compensation expense versus the first quarter.Net loss in the quarter was $4.8 million, or a loss of $3.65 per common share, compared to a net loss of $4.3 million, or $40.67 per common share, for the same period in 2022. The decrease in the net loss per share in the current year quarter is driven by the year-over-year increase in our weighted average share count.From a liquidity perspective, we ended the second quarter was approximately $9 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt and the balance sheet. And we had approximately 1.9 million common shares outstanding at June 30.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Jeffrey Cohen, Ladenburg Thalmann.Jeffrey CohenHi, good morning. How are you?Lynn BlakeGood morning, Jeff.Nestor JaramilloGood. Good morning, Jeff.Jeffrey CohenSo just a couple questions for now. So I guess firstly, any commentary specific to the critical care division, for the quarter, down 20% year over year? Was it one-time in nature or any contributing factors that we can be aware of?Nestor JaramilloYes. Good question, Jeff. I believe that the decline in critical care have a lot to do with our sales of consoles, often in new accounts, and also increasing what we call penetration in our current accounts. As I mentioned before, we're still seeing some of the lingering effects of the capital expenditure of hospitals.Jeffrey CohenGot it. Okay, that's helpful. Can you talk a little bit about the commercial team now versus last quarter? You talked about some streamlining that was done. Could you elaborate a bit on that for us? Thank you.Nestor JaramilloYes, of course. We consolidated three territories because we felt that it was more efficient and more productive to consolidate these territories. They were close in proximity. We had a very good sales reps and clinical specialists covering those -- after the consolidation, and we feel that this is going to be a more efficient way for us to provide clinical support to these territories.Jeffrey CohenOkay, got it. And then lastly for us, Lynn, any commentary on margins? Certainly, better than last year; not quite to the level that we were expecting. Do you expect that to come back a little bit in your favor over the back half of the year? Or should we knead our estimates for the back half to match up with the front half?Lynn BlakeYeah. So the year-over-year improvement was roughly half driven by favorable mix of higher disposable sales and about half by the write-off of the -- the write-off I mentioned in the prior year quarter, which was about $100,000. Sequentially, we would expect modest improvement in the second half of the year along with improved volumes. It's somewhat dependent, however, on disposables and consoles because we also expect higher console sales in the second half of the year. So I would say modest improvement sequentially.Jeffrey CohenOkay, got it. That's it for us. Thanks for taking our questions.Nestor JaramilloThank you, Jeff.OperatorAnthony Vendetti, Maxim Group.Anthony VendettiThank you. Before I ask a couple questions about the DaVita agreement, can you just talk about the -- I don't know if you keep the number. But how many Aquadex Systems were sold or reactivated this quarter?Nestor JaramilloWe have activated -- reactivated three accounts, and we have opened two new accounts in the first half of this year.Anthony VendettiOkay. So reactivated three, opened two new. Okay. And then obviously, the DaVita agreement definitely helped drive utilization. Is there anything else in the interim that the company is doing differently this year versus last year to drive increased utilization of the current systems that are installed?Nestor JaramilloWell, in addition to the DaVita that we expected to have an important increase in utilization, we have the clinical data that has come out in the last seven months in peer-reviewed journals that has driven a lot of the utilization, especially in the heart failure segment. We expect a few more publications the second half of this year in critical care, cardiac surgery specific. And we expect those publications to continue driving utilization.Anthony VendettiOkay, great. And then just a little more on the DaVita agreement. So there's select markets that you're going to roll this out into. Have those been identified? And then any color on how -- once it's been rolled out into those select markets, what's the timeframe, if there has been one established, to roll that out into other territories?Nestor JaramilloYes. We have identified a handful of centers where we -- where DaVita has good presence and so do Nuwellis. And this is the ideal account for us to start the pilot. We are, right now, in conversations with them. There has -- there's a lot of steps before we start having patients treated in the multi-treatment rooms in DaVita's hospital accounts. And we expect to start treating patients in November of this year.Anthony VendettiIn November of this year, great. And then just on the cash burn and -- is there any -- I know you've cut costs. But are there any other costs that you think can be cut to control the cash burn? Or do you feel like at this point, the company is as lean and is rightsized as could be at this point?Nestor JaramilloThere is always ways to cut more expenses, but we have -- we're playing a balance between cutting expenses and our future. We're investing significant dollars in our REVERSE trial, multi-center randomized trial, as well as in the development of the pediatric device. We have also streamlined our operations here in the home office. So with those changes and the consolidation of three of the territories, we believe that we are well positioned to have an efficient organization as well as prolong our runway.Lynn BlakeAnthony, I'll just add. We have had high professional fees in the first half of the year associated with a number of activities, including negotiation of the DaVita agreement, as you would expect. So we would expect -- I expect lower professional fees overall in the second half of the year as well.Anthony VendettiOkay, great. That's helpful. All right. Thanks, Nestor. Thanks, Lynn.Nestor JaramilloThank you, Anthony.OperatorBrooks O'Neil, Lake Street Capital Markets.Brooks O'NeilGood morning, everyone.Lynn BlakeMorning, Brooks.Brooks O'NeilSo I'll just follow on with Anthony's questions a little bit. It strikes me, I guess, that the DaVita opportunity is really substantial for you guys, assuming they get engaged in really promoting the product. So what are your realistic expectations for what impact the DaVita agreement can have?And you said, I think, to Anthony that they're going to start selling in November. But what's the timeframe in which you expect some impact? And are we thinking this could be a meaningful inflection for the revenues at the company? Or are you -- would you put more eggs in the basket of the REVERSE trial or the pediatric device?Nestor JaramilloWell, let me see if I can unwind the three points that you were trying to make there.Brooks O'NeilRight.Nestor JaramilloFirst of all, I do believe that this is going to be an inflection point for us. Their sales organization is four times the size of ours. They have a lot more accounts under contracts. And so they have a very mature and extensive clinical team.Regarding the expectations, that's why we are doing the pilot. We're going to learn a great deal during the pilot, which has already started, as I mentioned before. And the pilot will last until May of next year. That's the time that we have given the pilot to be successful and also to learn a lot about what is the quantification of these potential collaboration. Did I answer all your --Brooks O'NeilOkay. Yeah, you kind of did.Lynn BlakeAnd I got to add -- Brooks, I was going to add as well. So thinking about the uplift in revenue trajectory -- as Nestor said, the pilot goes through most of the first half of the next year. I think the second half of next year could be a significant uplift once commercialization starts.And a factor in that is -- we mentioned in the call. We're continuing to really see headwinds from hospital capital purchase cycle, and we're not alone in that. And in this model, we sell the products to DaVita. DaVita doesn't have to sell the products. They're just offering a treatment across their centers, their divisions. So that will also be really a tailwind for us around that capital cycle.Brooks O'NeilSure. I mean, not to beat a dead horse, I know I've probably asked about this over time. But every time I think about this situation, I think -- unless I really don't understand the claw back to hospitals and other providers relative to hospital readmissions, to me, this seems like a no-brainer for a hospital that's dealing with heart failure patients, could be dealing with them in an outpatient setting, could eliminate or reduce hospital readmissions related fluid overload.And yet, even with all the things you've been doing, it seems like getting traction is hard. And I just would love any insight you can offer in terms of what's preventing these hospitals from seeing what seems fairly logical and obvious to me?Nestor JaramilloYes. No, we totally agree with you, Brooks. The way that this technology's working have a significant clinical and economic impact to patients, providers, as well as hospitals. We need to be patient because in medtech, as you know very well, clinical evidence is very important. And we have received a lot of publications in the last seven months, but the unequivocal data for us is going to be the REVERSE trial.And that's why we continue to conduct that trial, spend resources in the trial to get that information that we need. And also, in the same time, we continue to work on reimbursement and try to work towards getting this therapy in the guidelines. So that's kind of the path that we are taking. And we continue to be focused to make this therapy the standard of care. It's very easy -- yeah, it's very --Brooks O'NeilAll right. I believe it should be -- great. Thank you.Nestor JaramilloI was just going to say that it's not easy to change the trajectory of medicine when most of these patients, as Dr. Jefferies mentioned, have been treated with oral and intravenous diuretics, despite the fact that there has been a lot of technology available or more predictable ways to remove fluid from patients that are suffering from fluid overload. But I --Brooks O'NeilYeah, I get that. I mean, when I -- is the data still the same that it was a few years ago, that heart failure and fluid overload is the number one cause of hospital readmissions across every area of medicine today?Nestor JaramilloYes, we believe that that is what the data showing. That of the million heart failure hospitalizations, 90% of them are due the symptoms of fluid overload.And Brooks, our message is working. We increased the number of patients are treated with Aquadex by 14% over last -- second quarter of last year. So we continue to increase the utilization, the number of patients treated. And that is because of the clinical data that we have provided to the physicians.Brooks O'NeilThat's good. All right. I continue to believe. So I'm waiting up for it.Nestor JaramilloYeah, continue believing, Brooks.Brooks O'NeilRight. Thank you.Lynn BlakeThank you, Brooks.Nestor JaramilloThank you.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jaramillo for any closing remarks.Nestor JaramilloWell, thank you, operator. In conclusion, I want to reiterate how excited I am about our future. Our new collaboration with DaVita, the growing body of clinical evidence, and the pediatric product pipeline all support our efforts to make the Aquadex ultrafiltration therapy the new standard of care and available to fluid overload patients resistant to diuretics, which today is the current standard of care.On September 21 of next month, Nuwellis will be participating in a fireside chat at the virtual Gilmartin Group Emerging Growth Showcase. Live and archived access would be available on the Investors section of our website.As we conclude our call, I would like to thank all our stakeholders, Nuwellis employees, stockholders, physicians, nurses, patients, and healthcare workers in the field. Without you, we would not be able to achieve key advances in transforming the lives of patients suffering from fluid overload.Thank you for your ongoing engagement and support.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble Procter &amp; Gamble Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Jon Moeller, sold US$4.5m worth of shares at a price of US$149 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$157. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 10% of Jon Moeller's stake.Procter &amp; Gamble insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Procter &amp; Gamble better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Procter &amp; Gamble Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Procter &amp; Gamble shares. Specifically, Chief Executive Officer of Baby Ma. de Vera Francisco ditched US$1.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Procter &amp; Gamble insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$192m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Procter &amp; Gamble Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold Procter &amp; Gamble shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Procter &amp; Gamble makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Procter &amp; Gamble. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble and we suggest you have a look.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

As employer sentiment and business health remains steady, there are opportunities for employers to support employee financial health.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230808629667/en/Second wave of insights for 2023According to the latest Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM, while both employers’ and employees’ top concerns include rising costs and macroeconomic challenges, employers feel more satisfied with their business’s present financial situation than employees feel about their personal finances. And although employees and employers largely report they’re able to meet their respective financial obligations, that doesn’t translate into workers feeling as satisfied with their current financial situation. Only 34% of employees are ""always"" or ""often"" satisfied about their personal finances compared to more than 70% of employers who are ""always"" or ""often"" satisfied about their business’s finances.""As business owners continue to see growth, it’s important to recognize their employees may feel less confident about their financial growth and there are ways to provide greater support,"" said Amy Friedrich, president of Benefits and Protection at Principal®. ""Employer support could be offering financial wellness tools or providing a holistic benefits package that meets their employees’ needs. This support can be a key differentiator for employers, helping them retain talent, while also making a real difference in the financial lives of their employees.""According to the survey, nearly two thirds of employees wouldn’t be able to cover expenses for longer than three months if they lost their main source of income. When examining this trend based on demographic differences, over half (55%) of Gen Z and 44% of Millennial employees wouldn’t be able to cover expenses after the first month without their main source of income. Additionally, women are more likely to say that they couldn’t cover expenses for more than one week, while men are more likely to say they’d be able to cover expenses for six months or more.Story continuesBusinesses continue to experience high levels of growthEmployer sentiment remains high, despite persistent concerns about inflation and the stability of the U.S. economy. More businesses are currently growing compared to this time last year (64% vs. 52%). Small businesses1 also reported year-over-year increases in growth (58% vs. 46%). However, while most businesses report growth, they’re less optimistic about the overall growth of the U.S. economy.""Small businesses continue to demonstrate positive sentiment and steady cash flow,"" said Friedrich. ""However, when you move beyond their specific business or region, employers are less confident about the broader economy.""Employer support for financial well-beingEmployers play a critical role in the financial well-being of their employees2. With more than half of employees more stressed about their finances than last year, there are opportunities for employers to pass on their positive sentiment and build a foundation that enables employees to plan for their financial futures.The survey found the more optimistic a business is about the next 12 months, the more likely they are to add certain benefits such as critical illness, childcare support, financial wellness programs, and Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) to name a few.Financial wellness programs are expected to emerge as an additional plan resource to further personalize the employee experience3. Outside of retirement savings programs, top financial wellness benefits small businesses believe should be offered include helping employees establish a budget and financial plan, retirement income planning, and investment education. These benefits are key to boosting how secure employees feel across life and work.See all results and insights from the latest Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM (PDF).1 Businesses with two to 499 employees.2 According to the 2022 Global Financial Inclusion Index sponsored by Principal Financial Group3 According to the 2023 Principal Future of Retirement SurveyAbout the Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSMThe Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM surveys business owners, decision makers and business leaders aged 21 and over who work at companies with 2 – 10,000 employees.

351,304c71c1-c313-39bf-826c-c2af9149e6ea,AWK,2023-08-09,4 Stocks to Buy Now From the Prospering Water Supply Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-now-prospering-121900028.html,1691497140,STORY,"['AWK', 'MSEX']","[Water utilities work day in and day out to ensure an uninterrupted supply of clean potable water and reliable sewer services to millions of customers in the United States. These are essential for healthy and hygienic living.The aging of pipelines is concerning but water utilities continue with their upgrade and maintenance projects to minimize disruptions in operations. American Water Works Company AWK, with its widespread operations, provides services to domestic customers and military bases and offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the water utility space. Other utilities worth retaining in one’s portfolio are Essential Utilities WTRG, Middlesex Water Company MSEX and Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO.About the IndustryThe Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry includes companies providing drinking water and wastewater services to industrial, commercial, residential customers and military bases. Water utility operators own nearly 2.2 million miles of pipelines that are getting old. Utilities continuously replace old pipelines and add new ones to expand operations. Utility operators own storage tanks, treatment plants and desalination plants to supply uninterrupted potable water to customers. The highly fragmented industry creates operational challenges but increasing efficient water use by individuals and other industries will ensure that previous water is not wasted. A large nation like the United States already has a widespread water infrastructure in place but proper maintenance and upgrade of aging infrastructure becomes crucial for the supply of potable water to millions of consumers.3 Trends Pivotal for Shaping the Water Supply Industry's FutureFragmented Water Industry Needs Consolidation:  Since the U.S. water utility industry is highly fragmented, upgrading aging assets to provide quality services is the need of the hour. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), at present, 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 wastewater treatment systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. The industry creates operational challenges in meeting the requirement for replacement and adding to the aging water and wastewater infrastructure. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small players to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investment required to upgrade old and acquired assets. Water conservation and initiatives taken by large water operators in educating their consumers on the efficient use of appliances and detecting leakage should help to prevent wastage.Story continuesAging Infrastructure Needs Huge Investments: The water and wastewater infrastructure is aging and gradually nearing the end of its effective service life. Per the findings of the ASCE, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. It is evident that this industry needs more investment for maintenance and upgrade. Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), an estimated $744 billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand the drinking water and wastewater service to meet demand over the next 20 years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $50 billion to EPA to strengthen the drinking water and wastewater systems of the United States. A major portion of the investment will be directed to upgrading water infrastructure serving disadvantaged communities.Efficient Use Will Save Precious Water: Usage of water-efficient techniques, the use of advanced water-efficient appliances and timely actions taken to fix pipeline leaks will save precious water. If we use water more efficiently, it will not only lower wastage but reduce monthly utility bills. New methods used to cool turbines of power plants and efficiency in water usage in irrigation for farming reduce water usage. Lower use per person allows water utilities to meet the needs of an expanding customer base without increasing capacity to a great extent. In a way, efficient usage and a reduction in wastage allow water utilities to keep their service rates unchanged for a longer period for consumers and assist water utility operators in increasing their earnings by serving a larger population with the same water supply capacity.

FCX, Ero Copper ERO, Energy Fuels UUUU and Coeur Mining CDE.4 Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Stocks to Watch Amid Industry TurmoilThe prospects of the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry look bleak as weak demand in China has been weighing on metal prices. Industry players are also grappling with inflated costs, labor shortages and supply-chain issues. However, the demand for non-ferrous metals is expected to be strong, mainly driven by the energy-transition trend, which will buoy the industry.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Ero Copper, Energy Fuels and Coeur Mining. These companies are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs, while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries, including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy.Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process. Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit, followed by the assessment of ways to extract and process ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, precede the actual mining operations.The miners continuously seek opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets internally and through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Current Weakness in Metal Prices is Concerning: Copper prices started this year on a strong note, fueled by investor expectations of a surge in demand after the reopening of the China economy. However, data from China continue to signal contraction in the country’s construction and manufacturing sector. This suggests that the much-awaited recovery from extended COVID-led lockdowns has not materialized and fueled concerns that economic support from the government will not be enough to add significant traction to industrial activity. This has weighed on copper prices.Story continuesAfter gaining in the earlier part of the year, aided by the ongoing uncertainty around global economic growth, gold and silver prices have also recently lost steam, dragged by a strong dollar and elevated bond yields. Nevertheless, metal prices will eventually pick up, aided by the demand-supply imbalance.Overall, industry players are dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and a lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. While demand has been strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, will favor the industry in the long haul.Labor Shortage, High Costs Remain Worrisome: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which has hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. Industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues.Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. Industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.Strong Demand to Support the Industry: Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future, given their wide use in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials. The demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy is expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will also require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull prospects for the near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #184, which places it in the bottom 26% of 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Versus S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months. The stocks in this industry have collectively surged 79.5% in the past year compared with the Zacks Basic Materials sector’s rise of 10.7%. The S&amp;P 500 has grown 9.5% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining- Non Ferrous stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 5.58X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.39X. The Basic Materials sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is at 6.66X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 8.88X and as low as 3.41X, with the median at 6.38X.4 Mining - Non Ferrous Stocks to Keep an Eye OnEnergy Fuels: The company recently stated that it completed the sale of 80,000 pounds of uranium to a major U.S. nuclear utility in the second quarter of 2023 — its first delivery under its new portfolio of long-term uranium sales agreements. The sale proceeds of $4.34 million resulted in a gross margin of 46% per pound of uranium. It plans to sell an additional 180,000 pounds of uranium this year, per its supply agreements with U.S. nuclear utilities, for $54-$58 per pound. This is expected to lead to a gross margin of 46-50%.The company is making significant progress in preparing four conventional uranium and uranium/vanadium mines to resume ore production. The recent sale of the lower-priority Alta Mesa ISR Project will provide UUUU with significant additional cash and working capital, enabling it to ramp up its US industry-leading uranium and rare earth element (“REE”) production.To this end, it has made modifications and enhancements at the White Mesa Mill, which will produce 800-1,000 MT per year of neodymium-praseodymium (""NdPr"") oxide by late 2023 or early 2024. This is expected to position Energy Fuels as one of the world's leading producers of NdPr outside China.This Lakewood, CO-based company, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, exploration, processing, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium, vanadium and REE. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at 59 cents, suggesting a turnaround from the loss of 38 cents reported in fiscal 2022. The estimate has moved up 18% over the past 90 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Freeport-McMoRan: FCX’s exploration activities near existing mines, which are focused on expanding reserves, will drive growth. It is expected to benefit from the ongoing large-scale concentrator expansion project at Cerro Verde that will likely result in incremental annual productions of 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum.Cerro Verde's expanded operations will also offer cost efficiencies, and large-scale and long-lived reserves. It is evaluating a large expansion at El Abra to process additional sulfide material. The expansion at Morenci increased milling rates significantly. The company is increasing its operating rates at Lone Star to achieve production of 300 million pounds of copper from oxide ores in 2023 compared with the initial design capacity of 200 million pounds.The oxide project at Lone Star advances the opportunity for the development of the underlying large-scale sulfide resources. The focus on cost management and reduction of debt levels is commendable. The company’s shares have gained 41% in a year.Based in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan is engaged in mineral exploration and development; mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver; and smelting and refining copper concentrates. FCX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.5%, on average. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Ero Copper: The company produced 12,004 tons of copper in the second quarter of 2023, up 29% on a sequential basis. The company has been progressing on its strategic initiatives, which will drive significant near-term growth. Among these, construction of the Tucumã Project is running per the schedule and is 45% completed so far.At the Caraíba Operations, the pre-sink phase of development at the new external shaft was completed in the second quarter, with the headgear and winder installation on track to commence main sinking before the end of this year. At the Xavantina Operations, horizontal development into the new Matinha vein was completed in the second quarter, with the first production expected in the remaining part of the year.Backed by these developments, the company’s shares have surged 106% over the past year. ERO is on track to double copper production to more than 100,000 tons in 2025 and expects to achieve higher sustained gold production levels of 55,000-60,000 ounces per year beginning in 2024.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Vancouver, Canada-based company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 17.6%. SCCO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7%, on average. The company engages in the exploration, development and production of mining projects in Brazil. It produces and sells copper concentrate from the Caraíba operations, located within the Curaçá Valley, northeastern Bahia state, and gold and silver by-products. ERO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Coeur Mining:  The company reported a total production of 69,039 ounces of gold and 2.5 million ounces of silver in the first quarter of 2023. The numbers were higher than expected, aided by solid performances at Palmarejo, Rochester and Wharf. Production levels are expected to increase in the second half of the year due to mine plan sequencing, as well as the anticipated ramp-up and commissioning of the Rochester expansion.CDE’s solid balance sheet positions it well to support the capital requirements. Exploration success continues at Silvertip and Kensington, which bodes well for long-term growth. The company recently announced that grades at Silvertip continued to be among the world’s highest compared with similar carbonate replacement deposits. Recent drilling indicates new mineralized zones identified in Upper Kensington, suggesting promising potential for mine life increases.This Chicago, IL-based company explores, develops and produces gold, silver, zinc and lead properties, with five operations in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at a loss of 13 cents. However, the estimate suggests an improvement from the loss of 32 cents reported in fiscal 2022. The estimate has narrowed from a loss of 19 cents per share stated 90 days ago. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

353,342ab028-f43e-383c-aea7-7ea7ae2a84a2,FCX,2023-08-09,4 Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Stocks to Watch Amid Industry Turmoil,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-non-ferrous-metal-mining-160200401.html,1691510520,STORY,"['SI=F', 'GC=F', 'HG=F', '^GSPC', 'FCX', 'UUUU', 'ERO', 'CDE']","[The prospects of the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry look bleak as weak demand in China has been weighing on metal prices. Industry players are also grappling with inflated costs, labor shortages and supply-chain issues. However, the demand for non-ferrous metals is expected to be strong, mainly driven by the energy-transition trend, which will buoy the industry.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX, Ero Copper ERO, Energy Fuels UUUU and Coeur Mining CDE. These companies are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs, while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries, including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy. Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process. Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit, followed by the assessment of ways to extract and process ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, precede the actual mining operations. The miners continuously seek opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets internally and through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Current Weakness in Metal Prices is Concerning: Copper prices started this year on a strong note, fueled by investor expectations of a surge in demand after the reopening of the China economy. However, data from China continue to signal contraction in the country’s construction and manufacturing sector. This suggests that the much-awaited recovery from extended COVID-led lockdowns has not materialized and fueled concerns that economic support from the government will not be enough to add significant traction to industrial activity. This has weighed on copper prices. After gaining in the earlier part of the year, aided by the ongoing uncertainty around global economic growth, gold and silver prices have also recently lost steam, dragged by a strong dollar and elevated bond yields. Nevertheless, metal prices will eventually pick up, aided by the demand-supply imbalance. Overall, industry players are dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and a lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. While demand has been strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, will favor the industry in the long haul.Labor Shortage, High Costs Remain Worrisome: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which has hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. Industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. Industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies. Strong Demand to Support the Industry: Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future, given their wide use in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials. The demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy is expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will also require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull prospects for the near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #184, which places it in the bottom 26% of 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Versus S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months. The stocks in this industry have collectively surged 79.5% in the past year compared with the Zacks Basic Materials sector’s rise of 10.7%. The S&amp;P 500 has grown 9.5% in the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Ciurrent ValuationBased on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining- Non Ferrous stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 5.58X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.39X. The Basic Materials sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is at 6.66X. This is shown in the charts below.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (F12M)Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (F12M)Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 8.88X and as low as 3.41X, with the median at 6.38X.4 Mining - Non Ferrous Stocks to Keep an Eye onEnergy Fuels: The company recently stated that it completed the sale of 80,000 pounds of uranium to a major U.S. nuclear utility in the second quarter of 2023 — its first delivery under its new portfolio of long-term uranium sales agreements. The sale proceeds of $4.34 million resulted in a gross margin of 46% per pound of uranium. It plans to sell an additional 180,000 pounds of uranium this year, per its supply agreements with U.S. nuclear utilities, for $54-$58 per pound. This is expected to lead to a gross margin of 46-50%. The company is making significant progress in preparing four conventional uranium and uranium/vanadium mines to resume ore production. The recent sale of the lower-priority Alta Mesa ISR Project will provide UUUU with significant additional cash and working capital, enabling it to ramp up its US industry-leading uranium and rare earth element (“REE”) production. To this end, it has made modifications and enhancements at the White Mesa Mill, which will produce 800-1,000 MT per year of neodymium-praseodymium (""NdPr"") oxide by late 2023 or early 2024. This is expected to position Energy Fuels as one of the world's leading producers of NdPr outside China.This Lakewood, CO-based company, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, exploration, processing, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium, vanadium and REE. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at 59 cents, suggesting a turnaround from the loss of 38 cents reported in fiscal 2022. The estimate has moved up 18% over the past 90 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price: UUUUFreeport-McMoRan: FCX’s exploration activities near existing mines, which are focused on expanding reserves, will drive growth. It is expected to benefit from the ongoing large-scale concentrator expansion project at Cerro Verde that will likely result in incremental annual productions of 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum. Cerro Verde's expanded operations will also offer cost efficiencies, and large-scale and long-lived reserves. It is evaluating a large expansion at El Abra to process additional sulfide material. The expansion at Morenci increased milling rates significantly. The company is increasing its operating rates at Lone Star to achieve production of 300 million pounds of copper from oxide ores in 2023 compared with the initial design capacity of 200 million pounds. The oxide project at Lone Star advances the opportunity for the development of the un underlying, large-scale sulfide resources. The focus on cost management and reduction of debt levels is commendable. The company’s shares have gained 41% in a year.Based in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan is engaged in mineral exploration and development; mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver; and smelting and refining copper concentrates. FCX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.5%, on average. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Price: FCXEro Copper: The company produced 12,004 tons of copper in the second quarter of 2023, up 29% on a sequential basis. The company has been progressing on its strategic initiatives, which will drive significant near-term growth. Among these, construction of the Tucumã Project is running per the schedule and is 45% completed so far. At the Caraíba Operations, the pre-sink phase of development at the new external shaft was completed in the second quarter, with the headgear and winder installation on track to commence main sinking before the end of this year. At the Xavantina Operations, horizontal development into the new Matinha vein was completed in the second quarter, with the first production expected in the remaining part of the year. Backed by these developments, the company’s shares have surged 106% over the past year. ERO is on track to double copper production to more than 100,000 tons in 2025 and expects to achieve higher sustained gold production levels of 55,000-60,000 ounces per year beginning in 2024.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Vancouver, Canada-based company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 17.6%. SCCO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7%, on average. The company engages in the exploration, development and production of mining projects in Brazil. It produces and sells copper concentrate from the Caraíba operations, located within the Curaçá Valley, northeastern Bahia state, and gold and silver by-products. ERO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Price: EROCoeur Mining:  The company reported a total production of 69,039 ounces of gold and 2.5 million ounces of silver in the first quarter of 2023. The numbers were higher than expected, aided by solid performances at Palmarejo, Rochester and Wharf. Production levels are expected to increase in the second half of the year due to mine plan sequencing, as well as the anticipated ramp-up and commissioning of the Rochester expansion. CDE’s solid balance sheet positions it well to support the capital requirements. Exploration success continues at Silvertip and Kensington, which bodes well for long-term growth. The company recently announced that grades at Silvertip continued to be among the world’s highest compared with similar carbonate replacement deposits. ecent drilling indicates new mineralized zones identified in Upper Kensington, suggesting promising potential for mine life increases.This Chicago, IL-based company explores, develops and produces gold, silver, zinc and lead properties, with five operations in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at a loss of 13 cents. However, the estimate suggests an improvement from the loss of 32 cents reported in fiscal 2022. The estimate has narrowed from a loss of 19 cents per share stated 90 days ago. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Price: CDEWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But there are two major reasons that Munger is right.For starters, artificial intelligence is not a specific, tangible product like a toaster. It is a broad category of software-enabled processes that take on more shapes and forms than Proteus.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBecause AI performs a wide variety of functions across a wide variety of industries, most of us ordinary investors cannot easily determine the value that any one form of AI contributes to a given company.The AI initiatives at many companies are so early in their development that they are years away from generating significant profit growth. Even worse, many of the “pure-play” AI companies are producing sizeable losses and will not become profitable any time soon.For all of these reasons, most AI investments are simply “too hard.” Normally, therefore, we would ignore them and move on to investments that are easier to understand and quantify. But we don’t really have that luxury… at least not if we want to equip our portfolios to thrive in the years ahead.Like Glenn Close in the 1980s thriller, Fatal Attraction, AI investments “will not be ignored.” They will demand our attention for years to come.To provide a sense of the breadth and depth of AI technologies heading our way, consider the following public company.It should sound familiar…Is This The Next Explosive Market Sector?A select group of stocks are going bananas. With 230%, 379%, ever 865% gains and only a handful of investors have caught on… Here’s how to get in.One Company Capitalizing on the AI MegatrendFreeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) is the world’s largest copper miner. The terms “copper miner” and “artificial intelligence” do not obviously relate to one another. But in the case of Freeport, they do.Story continuesFreeport has been using a machine-learning model at its Bagdad copper mine in Arizona to boost production. This model uses data from sensors around the mine to “tailor” the ore-processing method to each of the seven distinct types of ore that come from the mine.Because of the company’s success with AI at Bagdad, it is rolling out the technology across several other mines and expects to increase its annual copper production by a hefty 5% “with very little capital investment.”That’s an extra $800 million per year of “free earnings” for a company that earns about $3 billion per year.Down the road, Freeport’s AI technology could enable the company to tackle more complex projects, and to extract value from places where its competitors cannot. That advantage could become incredibly valuable in a world that’s starving for battery metals like copper.The Next Phase of the AI MegatrendClearly, a “Wild, Wild West” of AI technologies is unfolding before us.Most of the early-stage AI initiatives I’ve highlighted above are still too new and/or small-scale to make any significant contribution to a company’s bottom line… yet.But all of these examples demonstrate that the AI megatrend is real, powerful, and gaining momentum by the day.Fortunately for we investors, this megatrend is still in its infancy, which means it will nurture a growing number and variety of investment opportunities over the coming months and years.To better explain, I recently held an “AI Impact Event” with my colleagues Luke Lango and Louis Navellier.In it, we showed viewers what AI’s $15 trillion wealth shift could mean for them.This event was something we’ve never done before… the first time Luke, Louis and I joined forces to create a brand-new research service.It’s called The AI Revolution Portfolio.

359,391daf19-f8a7-33c7-b278-42f82dc92edf,PEP,2023-08-09,3 ‘Strong Buy’ Dividend Stocks You Should Be Loading Up On Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-strong-buy-dividend-stocks-093447301.html,1691055287,STORY,"['PEP', 'MCD', 'KO']","[If you are an investor like me, your goal is to invest until you reach a point where you can simply enjoy passive income. It cannot only cover the monthly expenses but also allow you to enjoy retirement. While achieving this goal can be a dream of many, it needs a lot of planning and financial discipline to become a reality. Part of this strategy is to look for dividend-paying stocks that are reliable and stable. This means looking for companies that have thrived amidst different market conditions and have steadily paid dividends. Here are the three best dividend stocks to buy to pump up your retirement portfolio.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockOne of the strong buy dividend stocks is PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The company is a well-known name in the industry and already has a stronghold in the food and beverages segment. It is one of the biggest consumer food companies in the world. PepsiCo recently raised the earnings and sales outlook for the year and reported impressive quarterly numbers. It generated a revenue of $22.32 billion and an EPS of $2.09. The management now expects organic revenue of 10% as compared to the prior expectation of 8%.One solid reason to choose this company is its diversified business. It has a strong mix of healthy snacks and beverages which are driving growth. Its organic sales were up 13% in the quarter and it enjoys a dividend yield of 2.71%. Investors looking for a steady and reliable dividend income will love PEP stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe stock is exchanging hands for $188 today and is up 5% year-to-date (YTD). One good thing about the stock is that it moves steadily which means you will never see a huge upside or downside. It is one growth stock that can sustain in any market situation. Even if we are headed into a recession, Pepsi will continue to perform. This is because of its brand name and the wide range of product offerings.Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola Consolidated sign outside of their building. COKE Stock.Source: Jonathan Weiss / ShutterstockWhen it comes to dividends, Pepsi’s rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) isn’t far behind. The company is currently in the seventh consecutive decade of dividend growth and has increased the dividend payout for 61 consecutive years. This is no small feat. KO stock is trading at $61 today and is down 1.5% YTD. There aren’t any major swings in the stock movement which means you will enjoy stability with the stock.The company has a solid portfolio over 200 brands and its global presence helps generate solid revenue and profits. It saw a 5.7% year-over-year rise in net revenue in the recent quarter and hit $12 billion. Its organic revenue growth was 11% and the management raised the full-year forecast to between 8% to 9% as compared to the previous forecast of 7% to 8%.One reason to bet on the stock right now is its global presence. If anything is going on with the U.S. economy, the company can still rely on the global market for consistent sales. To add to that, the company has a 3% dividend yield which could boost your retirement portfolio. It has a dividend payout ratio of 56% and with an improvement in the revenue and balance sheet, the dividend payout could steadily rise. While the stock has been flat for a while now, it looks undervalued to me and is a solid long-term buy. This is one of the best dividend stocks to load up on this year.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's golden archesSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockThe one company that has stood strong even during inflation is McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). It has posted excellent growth and financials which make it one of the top stocks to own today. It saw a 11.7% rise in comparable store sales in the international market and has also seen higher customer traffic. Despite rising prices, it kept attracting consumers and this combination of growth and earnings is enviable. The company saw a 14% rise in net sales and the revenue hit $6.5 billion.I’ve said in the past and I’ll say it again, the company thrives on the franchise model and benefits from the rental charges. This is one reason it will continue growing sales and revenue numbers in the coming years. There is potential to push the profit margin higher as the economy stabilizes.MCD stock is trading at $289 today and is very close to the 52-week high of $299. The stock is up 10% year to date and over 85% in the past five years. Yes, it is at a premium right now, but I do not think it will drop anytime soon. The stock is only going to move upwards. With a dividend yield of 2.09% and a quarterly dividend payout of $1.52, the stock is worth an addition to your portfolio. There is a chance of increasing the payouts in the coming quarters and the upside potential of the stock is massive.On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Decibel Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: DBTX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to discovering and developing transformative treatments to restore and improve hearing and balance, today announced a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Decibel by Regeneron at a price of $4.00 per share of Decibel common stock payable in cash at closing, with an additional non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) to receive up to $3.50 per share in cash upon achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones for Decibel’s lead investigational candidate, DB-OTO, within specified time periods. The proposed acquisition values Decibel at a total equity value of approximately $109 million based on the amount payable at closing, and a total equity value of up to approximately $213 million if the CVR milestones are achieved.“We at Decibel are deeply committed to discovering and advancing innovative new therapies with the potential to be transformative for people with severe forms of hearing loss. We have built a pipeline of gene therapy product candidates for the ear that we believe have such potential. After full consideration, the Decibel Board has determined that this transaction is the best way to maximize shareholder value and ultimately benefit patients,” said Laurence E. Reid, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Decibel. “We have collaborated with our colleagues at Regeneron for the past six years and have huge respect for their research and development capabilities. We have full confidence that with Regeneron’s expertise and resources the Decibel pipeline can be optimally developed, and our team is committed to enabling that long-term success.”Story continuesDecibel and Regeneron established their initial collaboration in 2017, with an extension announced in 2021, and are developing three gene therapy programs targeting different forms of congenital, monogenic hearing loss. DB-OTO, which is currently in the global Phase 1/2 CHORDTM clinical trial, is an investigational cell-selective, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy designed to provide durable, physiological hearing to individuals with profound, congenital hearing loss caused by mutations of the otoferlin gene. Preclinical programs include AAV.103 for people with GJB2-related hearing loss and AAV.104 for people with stereocilin (STRC)-related hearing loss.“We are delighted to announce the planned acquisition of Decibel, who have been long-standing collaborators, notable for their deep scientific knowledge and commitment to people with hearing loss,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board co-Chair, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Regeneron. “DB-OTO, our shared lead investigational gene therapy, will soon reach patients in its first clinical trial, offering new promise to children with this rare form of congenital hearing loss, as well as potential proof-of-concept for future gene therapies addressing more common forms of genetic hearing loss. We believe that Decibel’s assets and specialized team will further strengthen our genetic medicines portfolio, enabling Regeneron to accelerate the development of innovative genetic therapies and a rich pipeline of hearing loss treatments.”Congenital hearing loss is a significant unmet medical need with no approved medical therapies that affects approximately 1.7 out of every 1,000 children born in the United States. While hearing loss caused by mutations of the otoferlin gene is rare, the majority of permanent, congenital hearing loss cases diagnosed in developed countries are sensorineural and result from a single gene defect, making them appealing targets for gene therapy. Hearing aids and cochlear implants may offer benefits, but they fall short of replicating normal hearing function.The merger agreement provides for Regeneron, through its wholly owned subsidiary Symphony Acquisition Sub, Inc., to initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Decibel at a price of $4.00 per share of Decibel common stock payable in cash at closing plus one CVR payable in cash subject to the terms and conditions contained in a contingent value rights agreement (“CVR Agreement”). CVR holders would become entitled to receive contingent payments as follows: (i) $2.00 in cash, upon the fifth participant being administered with DB-OTO in a clinical trial on or prior to December 31, 2024 (the DB-OTO Milestone); and (ii) $1.50 in cash, upon (a) the first participant being administered with DB-OTO in a registration enabling trial (as defined in the CVR Agreement) or (b) acceptance for review of a Biologics License Application by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a Marketing Authorization Application by the European Medicines Agency or the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or an equivalent application by the applicable national regulatory authority in any of Germany, France, Italy or Spain for DB-OTO, whichever occurs first, on or prior to December 31, 2028; provided the DB-OTO Milestone is achieved on or prior to December 31, 2024. There can be no assurance that any payments will be made with respect to the CVR. The closing of the tender offer will be subject to certain conditions, including the tender of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Decibel common stock and other customary closing conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer, Regeneron will acquire all shares not acquired in the tender through a second-step merger for the same consideration per share paid in the tender offer. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.Regeneron’s legal advisor for the transaction is Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz.

In fact, if we're fortunate to live long enough, each of us will eventually develop some kind of disability, whether it be short-term (something as common as breaking a bone) or something more permanent.This is why the accessibility and disability inclusion work we do as part of Cisco's Social Justice Actions is so critical. Because any of us can be-and nearly all of us will be-disabled at some point in our lifetime.As we commemorate the 33rd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, we reflect on the ways in which we have improved accessibility for our employees, partners, suppliers, and customers, and acknowledge the path we have yet to travel.Accessibility is the principle that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use the same things-whether that's a physical location, technology, systems, or content. Cisco's Social Impact Office looks at accessibility and disability inclusion through each of these lenses, recognizing the many ways in which Cisco engages with humans. This spans the recruiting and employment experience, our products and services, and how we interact with customers, partners and suppliers.""Unlike other identities-such as race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, and veteran status-anyone can suddenly find themselves disabled.""In addition to being subject matter experts in accessibility and disability inclusion and consultants to Cisco teams, we work on the Social Justice Action 12 accessibility workstream which relates to human rights in technology solutions. Specifically, we are responsible for assessing the state of accessibility at Cisco, proposing a strategy for improving accessibility throughout the enterprise, and moving that work forward.Story continuesTo see where Cisco's accessibility and disability inclusion gaps are, we conducted interviews with more than 100 people across every area of our business, including several focus groups with people who identified as disabled or neurodivergent.This research confirmed that there is still a tremendous opportunity to make Cisco and all our products truly accessible and inclusive-an effort that requires participation at all levels of the company as well as a mindset shift in how we conduct business.The business imperative is clear: increasingly, our customers are asking us about accessibility. We have also seen some instances where customers-particularly government buyers, educational institutions, and businesses in regulated industries-have formalized requirements for accessibility. Technology that does not meet these standards won't be considered.""Accessibility is the principle that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use the same things-whether that's a physical location, technology, systems, or content.""As leaders of this work, one thing we have been pleased to see is Cisco's public commitment to focusing on the disability and neurodivergent communities and putting accessibility on the executive agenda through participating in the Valuable 500, a global group of 500 companies working to end disability exclusion. As a part of our Valuable 500 commitment, Cisco has pledged to take action in four areas that support our belief that equal access to our products and workplace is a fundamental human right:We will design with human rights in mindWe will increase economic opportunities for people with disabilitiesWe will invest in training to support the recruiting, hiring, retention, and promotion of employees with disabilitiesWe will establish a permanent, dedicated accessibility infrastructure that is both resourced and accountableCisco's public commitment to doing this work and holding ourselves accountable for our progress is important to disabled people, but, really, it's important to all of us. Our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all. This means the technology and services we provide to our customers, partners, suppliers, and employees should be accessible to all.
