The Fisher Investments founder famously started his independent money management firm with $250 in 1979, a company that is now a $197-plus billion going concern, while Fisher’s own net worth stands north of $5 billion.So, for those getting restless from 2022’s unrelenting bear, Fisher has some very simple advice: ""The things that tend to drop the most in a bear market, when you get to the other side and come up the other side of the V, whenever it is, tend to bounce the most early on. So, that's why patience is a virtue... If you become patient, you’ll become worth more money.""Turning to Fisher for inspiration, we took a closer look at two stocks the billionaire made moves on recently. Using TipRanks’ database to find out what the analyst community has to say, we learned that each ticker boasts a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the analyst community. Let’s see why they are considered good investment choices right now.Marvell Technology (MRVL)The first Fisher-endorsed stock we’ll look at is a chip industry stalwart. Marvell is a maker of semiconductors and associated tech. The integrated circuit specialist serves a wide range of markets from data centers to automotive, enterprise networking to cloud and carrier infrastructure, amongst others. Following various acquisitions, the company's primary source of revenue has shifted from the consumer electronics sector to data infrastructure (data center, industrial, automotive, mobile network).Meanwhile, Marvell’s revenue and earnings have been trending in one direction – up. And though supply chain issues have made their presence felt, Marvell still managed to meet Wall Street expectations.The company will be releasing its fiscal third-quarter on December 1, but in the meantime, we can get a good feel for the company’s situation by looking back at the F2Q22 numbers. Specifically, revenue climbed by 41% from the same period a year ago to $1.52 billion, meeting Street expectations, while the company delivered adj. EPS of $0.57, coming in $0.01 above the $0.56 consensus estimate.Story continuesHowever, citing supply chain hitches, for FQ3, the company expects revenue of $1.56 billion, missing the $1.58 billion anticipated by the analysts, while for the bottom-line, the outlook called for adj. EPS of $0.59 at the midpoint, below consensus at $0.61.Overall, Marvell has been unable to withstand the bearish market forces and the shares have tumbled ~50% this year.Fisher obviously thinks they represent excellent value. He upped his stake considerably in Q3, and bought 11,133,134 MRVL shares, now worth in excess of $478 million.Echoing Fisher’s bullish stance, Credit Suisse’s Chris Caso sees plenty to like about the chip company.“Our longer-term favorable view of MRVL is due to the number of company-specific drivers that account for well over half of the Street revenue growth expectations heading into CY23,” the 5-star analyst explained. “Those drivers include hyperscale semi-custom silicon, the former Inphi business, automotive ethernet, the Innovium switch business and continued 5G rollouts. We expect that growth in all these areas is much less heavily dependent on end-markets, and will buffer against a market slowdown. In addition, spending by cloud operators has held up better than we would have thought given the compression in ad spending.”Backing his comments, Caso rates MRVL shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) while his $56 price target makes room for 12-month gains of 28%. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here)His colleagues agree - almost unanimously so. While one analyst favors sitting this one out, all 11 other reviews are to Buy, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target is more bullish than Caso will allow; at $61.67, the figure suggests shares will gain ~42% in the year ahead. (See MRVL stock forecast on TipRanks)Charles Schwab (SCHW)From the chip industry, let’s now pivot to an entirely different segment for Fisher’s next pick – to that of the financial services sector. Charles Schwab as a leader in the business of investment services, helping both retail and institutional clients invest in capital markets in a smart and efficient manner. Its services range from banking and securities brokerage to wealth and asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. Boasting around ~$7 trillion in client assets, the company is the U.S.’s 7th biggest banking firm.Part of Schwab’s modus operandi is to collect as many deposits and cash as it can and invest it so to generate interest. This is especially helpful for the present climate in which interest rates are rising and has helped the company perform well in 2022’s depressed environment.In the latest quarterly report, for 3Q22, revenue rose by 20% year-over-year to $5.5 billion, while beating the Street’s call by $80 million. The company generated a record $2 billion in net income, compared to the $1.5 billion delivered in the same period a year earlier. This resulted in adj. EPS of $1.10, trumping the Street’s $1.05 forecast.Not wanting to miss out on a compelling opportunity, Fisher pulled the trigger on 15,433,332 shares, giving his fund a new position in SCHW. Looking at the value of the new holding, it comes in at almost $1.26 billion.While J.P. Morgan’s Ken Worthington notes that the stock’s valuation is not cheap, he thinks there is good reason for that.“We believe Schwab is a well-managed and highly valued company that trades at a premium to peers based on an industry-leading brand for retail financial services,” Worthington opined. “We view Schwab as a growth company with numerous initiatives to drive both incremental organic growth and a higher fee rate. We see Schwab benefiting from an engaged retail trading base that should drive a future generation of Schwab’s investor clients.”To this end, Worthington rates SCHW shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) while his $102 average target suggests investors will be pocketing returns of ~26% a year from now. (To watch Worthington’s track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, with 9 Buys vs. 3 Holds, the analysts’ view is that this stock is Strong Buy. At $92.9, the average target implies 12-month share appreciation of ~15%.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.07bUS$5.89bUS$6.98bUS$8.87bUS$10.1bUS$11.1bUS$11.9bUS$12.7bUS$13.3bUS$13.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 13.62%Est @ 10.13%Est @ 7.68%Est @ 5.97%Est @ 4.78%Est @ 3.94% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$4.7kUS$5.0kUS$5.5kUS$6.5kUS$6.8kUS$6.9kUS$6.9kUS$6.7kUS$6.5kUS$6.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$62bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$226bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$226b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$103bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$165b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$173, the company appears about fair value at a 4.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.212. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Texas Instruments, there are three fundamental items you should further examine:Risks: For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (2 are a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for TXN's future outlook?

TI developed a new device screening specification called space high-grade in plastic (SHP) for radiation-hardened products and introduced new analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that meet the SHP qualification. TI also introduced new product families to the radiation-tolerant Space Enhanced Plastic (Space EP) portfolio. Compared to traditional ceramic packages, plastic packages offer a smaller footprint that enables designers to reduce system-level size, weight and power, and thus help reduce launch costs.Meet radiation and reliability requirements with space-grade plastic packagesIn the past, space applications and programs used hermetically sealed, ceramic Qualified Manufacturers List (QML) Class V devices to ensure reliability. Today, applications like those in new space, designed to increase commercial access to space programs through short-term missions in low Earth orbit (LEO), are helping expand communication and connectivity. For new space applications, there is a growing need for smaller components that help reduce system size and weight – and therefore lower the cost required to launch an application into space. Plastic substrate ball-grid array (PBGA) and plastic-encapsulated devices offer an alternative to traditional space semiconductor packages.New SHP ADCs improve thermal efficiency and increase bandwidth in a smaller sizeTI's SHP specification indicates integrated circuits (ICs) that meet the rigorous design requirements of deep space missions with extremely harsh environmental conditions. The SHP specification includes both PBGA and plastic-encapsulated packages for radiation-hardened semiconductors. The 10-mm-by-10-mm-by-1.9-mm ADC12DJ5200-SP and ADC12QJ1600-SP ADCs in flip-chip BGA SHP packages are the first products from TI that meet the SHP specification. These ADCs help enable designs as much as seven times smaller than those using equivalent ceramic-packaged devices, maximize data communication speeds with SerDes rates up to 17.1 Gbps, and reduce thermal resistance. Learn more about TI's SHP specification by reading ""How SHP in Plastic Packaging Addresses 3 Key Space Application Design Challenges.""Story continuesSpace EP product families increase power efficiency and save board space for new space missionsTI's Space EP portfolio is the industry's largest plastic, radiation-tolerant power management and signal-chain portfolio, with devices specifically designed for smaller, high-volume LEO satellite applications. Space EP devices can help save as much as 50% board space compared to traditional ceramic packages, and deliver high-performance power supplies with rail-to-rail input/output operation. The TPS7H5005-SEP family of pulse-width modulation (PWM) controllers are the newest products in TI's Space EP portfolio, and support multiple power-supply topologies and field-effect transistor (FET) architectures. TPS7H5005-SEP PWM controllers minimize power loss through synchronous rectification, enabling at least 5% higher power efficiency compared to equivalent devices. Learn more about TI's Space EP products by reading the application note, ""Reduce the Risk in Low-Earth Orbit Missions with Space Enhanced Plastic Products.""With over 60 years in the space market, TI continues to develop radiation-hardened and radiation-tolerant products and packaging that enable designers to meet mission-critical requirements with increased power density, performance capabilities and reliability.AvailabilitySpace EP and SHP devices are available for purchase on TI.com and through authorized distributors.

Since then, some have continued to languish, but the better stocks have come back strongly.Investors should focus on the stocks showing the strongest relative strength in the various REIT subsectors. Take a look at the three of the best-performing office REITs over the past month (Note: Only REITs over $5 per share were considered):Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. (NYSE: ARE) is a Pasadena, California-based REIT with a portfolio of 74.5 million square feet that’s home to more than 1,000 tenants devoted to life science, agtech and technology companies — what its website calls “top innovation clusters.” Locations of its assets include cities such as Boston, New York, Seattle and San Francisco.Boosting Alexandria Real Estate Equities’ performance over the past month was its third-quarter operating results. Revenue was up 20.5% over the same quarter in 2021, and funds from operations (FFO) came in at $2.13 per share, a 9% increase over the third quarter of 2021’s $1.95. Net income of $2.11 was well ahead of the $0.67 from the third quarter of 2021.Alexandria Real Estate Equities has a current occupancy rate of 94.3%. It’s paying an annual dividend of $4.72, yielding 3.7%. Shares are up 8.89% over the past four weeks, making it the best-performing REITs in the office subsector.Corporate Office Properties Trust (NYSE: OFC) is a Columbia, Maryland-based REIT that specializes in purchasing, leasing and managing data center properties, mostly government offices in the Washington, D.C., area.Corporate Office Properties Trust recently declared its 100th consecutive quarterly dividend payment, which is $0.275 per share.

CROX, Unum Group UNM, QuidelOrtho Corp. QDEL, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA and Clean Harbors, Inc. CLH.5 Stocks with Solid Sales Growth to Navigate Volatile MarketsConcerns, including the persistent disruptions in the global supply chain system, record-high inflation and the aggressive monetary policy globally, continue to weigh on investor sentiments. These have led to an increase in recession risks in the next six to nine months.Amid such headwinds and market volatility, investors are wary about entering the market. Hence, a conventional stock-picking strategy is the need of the hour, which will help generate robust returns. One such method is choosing stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, stocks like Crocs, Inc., Unum Group, QuidelOrtho Corp., LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Clean Harbors, Inc. are worth considering.While evaluating any company, revenues are often more analyzed than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base. Stable or declining sales growth indicates obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without solid revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continuous bottom-line improvement usually requires robust sales growth.Nonetheless, sales growth alone doesn't indicate much about a company's prospects. So, taking into account a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a sensible investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.Here are five of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening:Crocs, based in Broomfield, CO, is one of the leading footwear brands with a focus on comfort and style. CROX offers a wide variety of footwear products, including sandals, wedges, flips and slides that cater to people of all ages.Story continuesCrocs' expected sales growth rate for 2022 is 51.5%.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TMO for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Thermo Fisher Scientific's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Thermo Fisher Scientific's main business drivers.Headquartered in Waltham, MA, Thermo Fisher Scientific is a scientific instrument maker and a world leader in serving science. In Nov 2006, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. was formed through the merger of Thermo Electron Corporation with Fisher Scientific International Inc. On Feb 3, 2014, Thermo Fisher acquired Life Technologies Corporation.Following the acquisition, the new reporting segments are:Life Sciences Solutions Segment: This segment (39.9% of total revenues in 2021) was added post the acquisition of Life Technologies. It incorporates majority of the former Life Technologies and Thermo Fisher’s Biosciences businesses. In 2021, this business registered growth of 28.5% from 2020.Analytical Instruments: Formerly known as Analytical Technology, this segment (15.5%) has been renamed in order to reflect the transfer of the bioprocess production business to the newly formed Life Sciences Solutions Segment. In 2021, this business registered growth of 18.4% from 2020.Specialty Diagnostics (SD): This segment (14.4%), formed after the acquisition of Phadia, serves customers in healthcare and clinical laboratories with a portfolio of diagnostic test kits, reagents and instruments used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses to improve patient care. In 2021, this business registered growth of 5.9% from 2020.Story continuesLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services: Formerly known as Laboratory Products and Services, this segment (37.9%) has been renamed to to reflect the inclusion of the PPD acquisition. PPD will be referred to as clinical research business within this segment. This segment serves laboratory customers with equipment and consumables that improve productivity and a range of BioPharma outsourcing services. This segment also includes the company’s research and safety market customer channels. Post-acquisition, Thermo Fisher’s Global Chemicals business has moved to the Laboratory Products and and Services Segment. In 2021, this business registered growth of 21.4% from 2020.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Thermo Fisher Scientific, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $8,800.29, or a 780.03% gain, as of November 28, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 185.71% and gold's return of -2% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for TMO too.Thermo Fisher exited the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising. Thermo Fisher’s accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue. Thermo Fisher has outperformed its industry in the past year. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 9.41%, and there have been 10 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

11,f6b7afe2-65d1-3db2-b30b-6f66faf0c5e6,WMT,2022-11-29,11 Biggest Malls in Europe,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-biggest-malls-europe-232713328.html,1669678033,STORY,"['WMT', 'AAPL', 'TGT', 'AMZN', 'GPS', 'SBUX']","[In this article, we take a look at the 11 biggest malls in Europe. You can skip our detailed analysis of the European mall industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Malls in Europe.Market OutlookThe European retail industry is valued at $3.6 trillion as of 2021 according to Statista. There are roughly 10,000 malls in Europe as of 2021, with the United Kingdom taking the biggest share with over 1,500 malls, per their report. The European mall industry’s economic outlook is not very different from those of other regions when it comes to the mall's traditional purpose. Malls in general are declining in popularity, owing to factors like E-Commerce. The online sales already make up 15% of total shopping in most of Europe. The average retail growth is around 4% while online sales grow by an average of a far higher 20%. In fact, the pandemic lockdowns accelerated the E-Commerce growth to 43% in 2020, adding massive amount of value to stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).Moreover, the persistent inflation around the world and the central banks' rate hikes in response have put the mall industry on a slippery slope, as consumers cut back on spending. This has led European REITs to start adapting to a changing shopping landscape. An Adapting IndustryOne of the ways the industry is adapting is extended diversification, with European malls adding more and more experience and service-based incentives, like museums, art galleries, government offices and theme parks etc.  Florencio Beccar, the fund manager of CBRE Global Investors' European Shopping Center Fund, was quoted by NBC News at the purchase of a German mall that came with a medical facility. He said that purchasing malls with services like medical facilities and others is a major advantage to offset decline in physical retail.In addition to that, many REITs are moving towards logistics, which is another way the European mall industry is trying to adapt and survive. According to CBRE research, every $1 billion addition in online sales requires an additional space of 1.3 million square feet in warehouses, raising the demand for fulfillment centers. Story continuesInsofar as Europe is concerned, a Prologis report showed that every additional 1 billion euros in online sales resulted in an average increase in warehouse demand of almost 72,000 square meters in Britain, Germany, and France, during the studied period of 2007-2012. Logistics also has a cost advantage. Retail space costs around $20 per square foot while the same for logistics costs only $6.5. Its yield is also two percentage points higher on average than retail. This has resulted in malls across the world in general and malls in Europe in particular, attempting to transition and rezone the spare retail spaces in their buildings for the logistics business.Simon Hope, the global head of capital markets for the UK-based property consultant Savills, confirmed the trend with NBC News, saying, “logistics is the new retail.”Key PlayersThere are thousands of malls in Europe but some of the most prominent names in the industry are Mega Belaya Dacha in Russia, Westfield Centro in Germany, Bluewater in the UK and Istanbul Cevahir in Turkey. As far as mall-owning REITs are concerned, Klépierre SA (OTCMKTS:KLPEF) is the biggest mall owner in Europe. It owns 155 malls across 16 European countries.Now that we know the state of the mall industry in Europe, let’s move on to the 11 biggest malls in Europe. 11 Biggest Malls in EuropePixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor our list of the 11 biggest malls in Europe, we’d be ranking them based on their total area.

""Quaft?""- Qraft.- Qraft.- I think it's probably Qraft.- I'm just trying to figure it out. I don't know.- Q-R--BRAD SMITH: If you are Donald Duck, yes.- Yeah, right, ""Quaft.""- In any case, as we look at the setup here this morning, Sozz, you referenced it briefly earlier, right, the Goldman note that we-- I mean, we get a Goldman note every Monday, but Goldman talking up the recession chances, right, in its most recent note?- Yeah, I encourage everyone, go to YahooFinance.com. You can see the story I wrote up. It's about 300 words, quick read. Share with everyone. But then outlining that at least from a broader market perspective, a recession next year is not priced into stocks. They're recommending people stay overweight cash. What does that mean in plain English? They want you to have more cash in your portfolio than stocks.- All right, that's kind of similar--- What we do.- --to what we were hearing from John Augustine a few moments ago as well.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, indeed, well, taking a look at how we've opened up here just after the opening cross, we've got the Dow Jones Industrial average up by about-- or excuse me-- lower by about 3/10 of a percent. We've opened here on the day, down by about 112 points for the Dow NASDAQ composite. That's lower by about 7/10 of a percent, 70 points to the downside there. And then the S&amp;P 500, you're seeing that lower by about 6/10 of a percent.On this Cyber Monday, I want to take a look at some of the retail names that are also on the move here. You've got Amazon. That's higher by about 7/10 of a percent, Walmart, as well as Home Depot also in positive territory. And just kind of putting this an an equal setting here, just to get a good look at where you've got some of the divide that's taking place, oh, yes, surprise, surprise, Bed Bath Beyond, that is down by about 3%.- I think they're still trying to get people through the door for Thanksgiving. Good luck.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Yeah. It's the foot traffic concern, as well as the heavy promotional environment right now. Macy's as well, that's down by about 6/10 of a percent. We'll keep an eye on that one as we move forward throughout the day, but interesting, catching a bid for Nike. You've got Foot Locker.

Target regularly has great low prices on their own brand of Up &amp; Up Paper Towels, but, according to the Krazy Koupon Lady, they also beat out Walmart on some name brands, including:Cottonelle Ultra ComfortCare Toilet Paper, 12 mega rollsTarget: $12.99Walmart: $19.98Charmin Ultra Gentle Toilet Paper, 12 mega rollsTarget: $14.99Walmart: $28.95But the savings go beyond just paper towels into bath towels as well. A good towel can make or break the post-shower or bath experience. Nobody wants to reach for a threadbare towel that barely sops you up. Target has an excellent selection of bath and hand towels, with good thread count and in lots of seasonal colors at excellent prices, according to Reader's Digest.Rawpixel / Getty Images/iStockphoto10. ToysOne of the reasons many people like to shop at Target is because consumers can find so many of the things they need in one spot. Keep your kids happy by sending them to the toy aisle, and keep yourself happy by realizing the toys at Target are often cheaper than Walmart. Krazy Koupon Lady's price comparison reveals Target to be the winner in several areas.An example:LEGO Star Wars The Armorer's Mandalorian Forge 75319 Building KitTarget: $29.99Walmart: $54.95Additionally, Target often offers coupons and discounts through their app, which can really drive the prices down.More From GOBankingRatesSocial Security: Proposal for $2,400 Extra in Checks Expanded and Reintroduced in CongressDo You Have a Tax Question?

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Marc Oken bought US$837k worth of shares at a price of US$167 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$168. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider bought shares at close to current prices. Marc Oken was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$203m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insiders?The fact that there have been no Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening.

(NYSE:LVS), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) are among the benefiters, though reinstated Covid-19 restrictions in China and the protests that followed have these stocks either paring gains or erasing them altogether.WYNN Leading GainersLast seen up 4.7% at $78.43, Wynn Resorts stock is outpacing its competitors. The equity has had support from the 20-day moving average since late October, but is now running into a newly formed ceiling at the $80 level.

Though shares are running into the resistance at the $45 region, they are still eyeing a fourth-straight daily win.

We're coming up against that opening bell on Wall Street to kick off this jobs report week. Let's take a look at some stocks moving on the Yahoo Finance platform. First up, casino shares in focus after the Macau government renewed the licenses for six casino operators, including resorts from Wynn, MGM, and Las Vegas Sands.The new licenses are expected to take effect at the beginning of next year and are allowed to carry a maximum term of 10 years according to Macau's gaming law. JP Morgan out with a flash deal on this one, guys, saying this could be a big catalyst for the stocks. They're recommending pretty much buy ratings across the board for the space as a result of this.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, we've seen tremendous growth in terms of post pandemic period where there has been more attention that's been thrust towards gaming, whether that be digitally or whether that be the in-person experience, and particularly for some of the resort operators as we're seeing even this kind of shift in traveler sentiment and how they are spending more money on those experiences versus goods, at least cyclically right now.You wonder where that could continue to move forward or at least kind of set a new benchmark rate that some of the casino operators could count on. But we do know that negotiations-- they're going to continue with some of the winners that got the final contracts. And then also they've got to have some type of investment in nongaming sectors as well, which is going to be an interesting kind of tidbit of this.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, it was pretty expected that they would get this still. It was sort of an overhanging uncertainty. And it's so interesting how these stocks trading today stands in stark contrast-- where this positive sentiment stands in stark contrast to what we're hearing from the mainland. But to put it in perspective here, gaming revenue in Macau is down to a record low of $49 million in July. That is a 98% decline from pre-COVID levels.Story continuesAnd part of the reason is that Macau is so dependent on the Chinese mainland. That's where most of the visitors who come there come from. Chinese-- gambling is still illegal in mainland China. It is not illegal in Macau obviously. And this-- now these new license renewal promises now guarantee that it is going to remain legal in Macau for now at these various casinos.So you know, it's a big deal that they're able to do this. But they're also trying to diversify where the travelers come from to come to Macau. And you know, that'll be an interesting challenge going forward to see if they can attract people from other places.BRIAN SOZZI: This would have been a disaster if they didn't get these license renewals.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, yes.BRIAN SOZZI: These companies have invested billions of dollars over the past decade to put large hotels and properties and tables in these areas. And clearly they needed this.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, Macau gets cited time after time, especially in the earnings calls for companies like Wynn. Wynn actually talking about that within their most recent earnings call as well, saying that the market continues to be challenging, of course, that the current environment. However, these contracts certainly give them some [? leeway ?] going forward from here.They're saying that the unique tourism offering during periods when the market is accessible really is highlighting some of that strong demand that they are forecasting and foreseeing, which really dovetails into how they go about getting these contracts and the competitive environment for making sure that they do get that 10-year time period too. So we'll see exactly where they're able to start to enact some of that as the negotiations start to finalize as well here.]"

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.The one trade that dominated most of 2022 has given up almost all of its gains.Oil touched its lowest level of the year on Monday morning, a victim of concerns over political turmoil in China and a potential hit to demand.Amid deep losses in both stocks in bonds and a cover-your-eyes plunge in crypto assets, oil prices surged in early 2022.For oil stocks, the story was — and remains — even better.Through Monday's close, the Energy (XLE) sector had gained more than 60% this year, the only one out of 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 to be sitting on year-to-date gains greater than 1%. As recently as November 15, XLE closed at a record high.“Either oil stocks are way overpriced, or oil itself is way underpriced,” Dan Dicker, founder of the Energy Word, told Yahoo Finance last week. For Dicker's part, he's in the latter camp, predicting oil will re-attain triple digits by late spring 2023.Calls for $200-a-barrel oil came fast and furious as WTI crude oil hit multi-year highs in early summer. As of the end of July, the median forecast for WTI crude oil at year-end 2022 stood at $103, according to a Bloomberg survey.Then came the letdown.Oil has slumped by more than 30 percent since that June high, as calls for a global recession sparked fear demand would decline as a result. The drop happened even as Saudi Arabia said in October it would cut production.And further output reductions may be coming.OPEC+ meets this Sunday to determine its target output level, and oil steadied on Monday after reports the cartel would consider further production cuts. On the flip side, news European Union representatives are meeting next Monday to decide on a price cap for Russian oil added to the recent stream of negative headlines for oil.Story continuesFor consumers, of course, much of this comes as welcome news, with the drop in oil feeding through to falling gasoline prices at the pump in the U.S., which have hit their lowest since February, according to GasBuddy data. The firm’s head of petroleum analysis, Patrick de Haan, predicted Monday the average cost per gallon could drop below $3 by Christmas.A pump jack operates in the Permian Basin oil production area near Wink, Texas U.S. August 22, 2018.

Traders cut net-long positions in ICE Brent crude by the most since early March — the sixth-largest reduction since 2011, when the CFTC started releasing the data.Still, fund managers are overweight energy stocks for the eighteenth straight month, the longest streak since 2012, according to Bank of America’s latest report. Investors surveyed were net 22 percent overweight energy in November, according to the firm.Stephen Schork, longtime oil analyst and author of the Schork Report, says that, at the very least, there's more volatility to come between now and the end of the year.Between China pressures, potential OPEC changes, and year-end tax effects in Houston which could also trigger swings in oil, Schork sees recent volatility as part of a bottoming process.""Short of a major economic contraction,"" Schork told Yahoo Finance, ""I do think we’re plumbing the bottom of the market right now.""What to Watch TodayEconomy9:00 a.m. ET: FHFA Housing Pricing Index, September (-1.2% expected, -0.7% during prior month)9:00 a.m. ET: House Price Purchasing Index, Q3 (4.0% during prior quarter)9:00 a.m. ET: S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, month-over-month, September (-1.20% expected, -1.32% during prior month)9:00 a.m. ET: S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, year-over-year, September (10.45% expected, 13.08% during prior month)9:00 a.m. ET: S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index (12.99% during prior month)10:00 a.m. ET: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, November (100.0 expected, 102.5 during prior month)EarningsBaozun (BZUN), Bilibili (BILI), Compass Minerals (CMP), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hibbett (HIBB), Intuit (INTU), NetApp (NTAP), Workday (WDAY)—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

A survey released on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence eased further in November amid persistent worries about the rising cost of living.Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin on Monday doused speculation the U.S. central bank would reverse course on interest rates relatively quickly next year in comments made late on Monday.And after similar messages from other Fed officials on Monday, investors were warily awaiting Powell's comments at a Brookings Institution event on Wednesday about the outlook for the U.S. economy and the labor market. Earlier this month Powell had dashed hopes of policy easing after a Fed meeting.""No one is willing to buy ahead of tomorrow with Powell speaking. Everyone is nervous about what he is going to say,"" said Ron Saba, senior portfolio manager at Horizon Investments in Charlotte.However, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia said earlier that weakening consumer confidence may have marginally helped to soften Treasury yields, weaken the dollar and boost stocks as investors viewed it as ""ammunition for the Fed to soften its hawkish impulse.""While the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.07 points, or 0.01%, to close at 33,852.53, the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.31 points, or 0.16%, to end at 3,957.63.Story continuesThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 65.72 points, or 0.59%, to 10,983.78 with pressure from tech sector heavyweight Apple, which manufactures its iPhones in China and has been impacted by COVID-related protests there.MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.01%.U.S. Treasury yields rose in choppy trading as investors waited for upcoming data including third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product, Chicago manufacturing numbers, factory activity based on the Institute for Supply Management and non-farm payrolls for November due out Friday.Benchmark 10-year note yields were up 5 basis points at 3.752% from 3.702% late on Monday.

The dollar index has fallen to 106.65 from a 20-year high as investors look toward the Federal Reserve reaching a peak rate early next year with inflation pressures expected to ease.""(The) strong rebound is being furthered by a weakening in the U.S. dollar and a need to discount some loss of Russian crude availability via next week's scheduled initiation of sanctions,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates.Oil prices, however, were hampered by concerns that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, would not adjust their output plans at their next meeting on Dec. 4.Five OPEC+ sources said OPEC+ is likely to keep oil output policy unchanged at its Sunday meeting, while two sources said an additional production cut was also likely to be considered. Neither, however, thought another cut was highly likely.Story continuesThe meeting, planned as an in-person gathering, may be made a partly or fully virtual event, sources said, which added to worries that a cut was not imminent.OPEC+ started to lower its output target by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, aiming to shore up oil prices.Markets are also assessing the impact of a looming Western price cap on Russian oil.Diplomats from the Group of Seven (G7) nations and the European Union have been discussing a cap on Russian oil between $65 and $70 a barrel, aiming to limit revenue to fund Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine without disrupting global oil markets.However, EU governments on Monday failed to agree on the cap, with Poland insisting it should be set lower than the level proposed by the G7, diplomats said.The price cap is due to come into effect on Dec. 5, and if there is no agreement, the EU is set to implement harsher measures agreed at the end of May - a ban on all Russian crude oil imports from Dec. 5 and on petroleum products from Feb. 5.(Additional reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar, Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo and Muyu Xu in SingaporeEditing by David Evans, Susan Fenton and Lisa Shumaker)]"

Additionally, the country’s National Health Commission on Tuesday said it will present measures to accelerate vaccination of the over 80s, a vulnerable age bracket in which over one-third is still unprotected.These measures followed widespread protests over the weekend amid growing public anger towards the country’s strict COVID-linked restrictions, and have prompted speculation that the Chinese government is considering scaling back its anti-COVID policies.Back in Europe, Spanish consumer inflation rose by 6.8% from a year ago in November, down from the previous month’s 7.3% advance.Additionally, the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's largest state by population, reported that consumer prices fell 0.8% on the month, a much sharper decline than the 0.2% expected by analysts, and a sharp reversal from October's 1.2% increase.This all reinforces expectations for a wider slowdown in European prices ahead of Wednesday's preliminary reading of Eurozone inflation for November.Inflation in the Eurozone is expected to come in at 10.4% in November, a small fall from October’s 10.6%, but these numbers suggest a bigger drop is possible.That said, ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Monday the region’s inflation has not peaked and it risks turning out even higher than currently expected, hinting at more interest rate hikes ahead.In corporate news, easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock fell 3.8% after the budget airline posted a full-year loss and scrapped its 2022 dividend, hit by surging fuel costs that outweighed a rebound in passenger demand.Story continuesCrude oil prices jumped Tuesday on speculation that the recent weakness will prompt OPEC+ to cut production when it meets next week.The crude market has struggled of late as rising COVID-19 cases in China, the world’s top crude importer, has meant the reintroduction of strict mobility restrictions, weighing on economic activity and thus demand for crude.At the same time, European and U.S. economies, the other major sources of energy demand, are rapidly approaching recession.This has resulted in crude prices falling below the levels that spurred October's supply cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+.By 03:40 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% higher at $78.63 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2% to $85.59.Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,755.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.0385.Related ArticlesEuropean stocks higher on Chinese COVID reopening hopesRenault chairman says confident of reaching deal with Nissan on future of allianceExclusive: India asked by sanctions-hit Russia for parts for key sectors - sources]"

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization's resilience dovetailed with a wider slowdown in asset activity of all stripes as the U.S. celebrated its annual Thanksgiving holiday and a lull in bad news related to crypto exchange FTX's implosion. The latter pause ended with BlockFi's petition.""We need to see if there's going to be more contagion coming,"" Marco Sampaio, co-founder and CEO of Hashdex, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""We know the macro is also playing a role in this. The pressure coming from China is also putting pressure on crypto or risky assets in general.""But Sampaio added cautiously: ""We need to see what's going to happen. We have many chapters to follow [in] the coming weeks.""Story continuesEther was recently changing hands at about $1,175, also up 1.3% from Sunday, same time. Ether's price fell roughly 3% earlier in the day after a ""whale"" address moved 73,224 ETH, worth $85.7 million, to Binance during Asia trading hours, according to an analysis by on-chain researcher Lookonchain. Investors typically transfer coins to centralized exchanges when they intend to sell or use the coins as a margin in derivatives trading.Most other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market capitalization were recently trading in the green, with popular meme coin DOGE up more than 5%, continuing an almost week-long surge whose spark remains unclear. DOGE alternative SHIB was up about 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was roughly flat.News of continued demonstrations in China, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and hawkish remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Monday sent equity markets tumbling with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closing off about 1.5%.Hashdex's Sampaio noted that institutional investors focused on crypto's long-term potential have been less affected by the industry's recent debacles than companies that have been trading and are ""dis-allocating"" their assets.

With so many institutions in the crypto economy on the verge of insolvency, the failure of another wouldn’t be surprising. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), protocols and everything in between seem to have been drained or hacked in the last few months.So when a joke popped up suggesting wETH might be next, the gallows humor was apparently real-sounding enough to be taken seriously by some readers without their guards up.Ether sank 4.8% in the ensuing 24 hours, outpacing bitcoin’s drop, although there’s no proof that the decline stemmed from the gag. Token price drops often stem from different factors.More to the point: The idea of wETH failing is really not something that would happen, at least in any traditional sense.What is wETH?First, we need to understand what wETH is. The ""w"" in wETH stands for ""wrapped,"" which means a token representing a fixed amount of another token, usually on a one-to-one basis. ""Wrapping"" is often used to describe representing assets on a different blockchain, as when ""wrapped"" BTC (wBTC) is created to represent bitcoin (BTC) on Ethereum (though wBTC and wETH are very, very different creatures). Wrapping an ether token on the Ethereum network might seem strange then.To summarize a long, technical problem: Ether, the token, doesn’t support the ERC-20 standard that virtually every decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol uses. Ether came before ERC-20; it’s Windows 3.1 in the era of apps and smartphones. So instead of fixing ether, it’s faster to just wrap it in a modern ERC-20 token.But it still is, in essence, another form of ether on the Ethereum blockchain.Why can’t wETH go insolvent?Unlike staked ether (stETH), or bridge protocols that allow you to “transport” tokens to different protocols (i.e., sending Solana-based tokens to Ethereum via Wormhole), wETH doesn’t have a centralized entity. Immutable, open-source smart contracts govern how wETH and ETH interact, and it’s simple to confirm that the wETH contract is fully backed at any given moment. There’s a risk that the smart contracts behind wETH could be hacked. WETH is pegged 1:1, and thanks to block explorers you can easily validate this.It’s transparent, decentralized and all on the same chain. So there’s basically near-zero risk and a depeg is really an issue, even if wETH might trade at a slight discount to ETH from time to time in digital-asset markets.Provided that it’s always possible to unwrap ether, which the smart contracts will do without a centralized authority, wETH will continue to properly function.Data from Dune Analytics shows there was a spike in unwraps over the weekend as the joke went viral.To be sure, this isn’t a bank run. Given that wETH currently trades at a slight discount to ETH, this might have generated more revenue for the protocol. For traders, the annoyance would primarily be from the gas fees. People might have lost $100, not their entire life savings.Sometimes jokes go too farWETH is a confusing topic. In theory there shouldn’t be a need for it, and eventually Ethereum will evolve to the point where it won’t be needed.But this is less to do with wETH and more to do with how a news cycle based on flashy tweets can cause panic. This joke was a complicated one that required a reader to have the technical context to properly understand it, and to find it funny.

Local media reports indicated that Chinese authorities will make an announcement later this session, prompting speculation that the Chinese government was considering scaling back its anti-COVID policies.This followed widespread protests over the weekend amid growing public anger towards the severe COVID-linked restrictions.Back in Europe, European investors will focus on inflation, with German and Spanish consumer prices scheduled for later in the session, ahead of Wednesday's preliminary reading of Eurozone inflation for November.Inflation in the Eurozone is expected to come in at 10.4% in November, a small drop from October’s 10.6%, but this is unlikely to stop the European Central Bank from continuing its rate hikes given this would still be more than five times its 2% target.ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Monday the region’s inflation has not peaked and it risks turning out even higher than currently expected, hinting at more interest rate hikes ahead.In corporate news, Nestle (SIX:NESN) guided its 2022 sales outlook higher, with the Swiss food giant forecasting its October organic sales would rise around 8%.Earnings from budget airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) are also scheduled for release.Crude oil prices jumped Tuesday on speculation that the recent weakness will prompt OPEC+ to cut production when it meets next week.The crude market has struggled of late as rising COVID-19 cases in China, the world’s top crude importer, has meant the reintroduction of strict mobility restrictions, weighing on economic activity and thus demand for crude.Story continuesAt the same time, European and U.S. economies, the other major sources of energy demand, are rapidly approaching recession.This has resulted in crude prices falling below the levels that spurred October's supply cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+.By 02:00 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $78.34 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.7% to $85.34.Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,751.00/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.0362.Related ArticlesEuropean stock futures higher; China's COVID rules, inflation data in focusHyundai Motor, SK On sign EV battery supply pact for N.

The recommendations also call for legislation to be passed that would transfer supervision over digital assets “that have a significant stability or monetary effect” to the Bank of Israel.The guidelines also include a proposal for allowing the payment of taxes on crypto held abroad through the Bank of Israel. In addition, the proposal would establish an inter-ministerial committee to oversee the regulation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).The taxation of cryptocurrencies comprises a major part of the proposal. According to Israel’s tax authority, uncollected crypto taxes from 2019 to 2022 could amount to several billion shekels (one shekel is worth about US29 cents).Israeli officials have been dipping their toes into the digital asset industry in recent months.

He also reiterated his view that rates need to rise by at least another 1% to between 5% and 5.25%.Separately, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said the central bank will likely begin trimming rates in 2024, as inflation pressures eventually ease. He also said that borrowing costs need to rise further to bring down inflation.Their comments boosted the dollar, with the greenback jumping nearly 0.7% on Monday. This weighed on most metal markets, particularly gold.Spot gold was flat around $1,741.33 an ounce, while gold futures expiring in December traded around $1,740.00 an ounce, remaining in backwardation. Both instruments sank around 0.6% on Monday.While Bullard and Williams’ comments provided some more clarity on U.S. monetary policy, they also dimmed optimism over a slower pace of rate hikes by the Fed in the coming months, given that rates will likely peak at much higher levels.This paints a dour picture for non-yielding assets such as gold, which fell sharply this year as U.S. rates began rising.Gold saw little safe haven demand this week, even as unprecedented civil unrest in China raised concerns over global economic disruptions.Copper, on the other hand, marked a volatile start to the week, sinking as much as 2% before recovering sharply to trade higher.The outlook for the red metal was dulled by the protests in China, which could further hamper the country’s appetite for commodities. Chinese citizens in several major cities took to the streets over the weekend to express their discontent with the country’s draconian zero-COVID policy.Story continuesCopper futures were steady around $3.6018 a pound in early trade on Tuesday.But some analysts opined that the protests in China may eventually push the government into relaxing its zero-COVID policy, which is at the heart of China’s economic slowdown this year. Such a scenario is likely to be positive for commodity markets.On the supply side, reports suggested that workers at Chile’s massive Escondida copper mine will not go on strike, reducing the prospect of tight supply in the coming months.Related ArticlesGold sinks below $1,750 on hawkish Fed comments, copper steadyOil prices slide on concerns over China's demandU.S. seeks to limit flaring and methane leaks from public lands drilling]"

This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Farmers National Banc FMNB, Hormel Foods HRL, Bank7 BSVN, BrownForman (BF.B) and Motorola Solutions MSI.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Watch on Recent Dividend Hikes Amid VolatilityAlthough the major U.S. indexes have recovered from the doldrums of the first half of 2022, the overall sentiment of investors remains cautious. The S&amp;P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq have registered a negative return of 15.50%, 5.90% and 27.87%, respectively, so far this year.Domestically, inflation in the United States, which remained the biggest threat to the economy, showed signs of cooling off after the consumer price index recorded a 7.7% increase year over year in October from the pick up of 8.2% in September and 8.3% in August. Investors are still worried about the high interest rate imposed by the Fed.The Federal Reserve's ambitious target of 2% is far from met, and market participants are concerned about the high borrowing cost that could cripple the economy and push it toward a recession. Such a situation will undoubtedly impact the business environment and hence stock market returns.At the same time, global issues, especially, the Russia-Ukraine war, which resulted in global oil and gas scarcity ahead of the chilling winter season, is leaving an indirect impact on the supply-chain disruptions. China's new COVID-19 breakout is also aggravating volatility in the stock market.Thus, investors seeking regular income in such an unstable situation may invest in dividend-paying stocks. These dividend stocks have shown profitability due to their proven business model, which helps them stay afloat during adverse economic conditions.Story continuesInvesting in such matured businesses, investors can expect a regular flow of income along withthe preservation of capital against unexpected price changes. It is often seen that a company that tends to reward its investors with a high dividend payout comparatively outperforms non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.On that note, let us look at companies like Farmers National Banc, Hormel Foods, Bank7, BrownForman and Motorola Solutions that have lately hiked their dividend payments.Farmers National Banc is a full-service national bank engaged in commercial and retail banking.

54,aa09a1e6-43ad-45e1-95ff-13d117830579,MSFT,2022-11-29,The 'exceptionalism of technology' is probably over for the stock market: Goldman,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-big-tech-stock-market-outlook-105145257.html,1669719105,STORY,"['GS', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL']","[For nearly a decade, mega-cap technology leaders like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) have dominated the U.S. stock market.But those days appear to be over, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs.David Kostin, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist, told reporters in a call Monday that technology is less likely to outperform by a stronger magnitude than other S&amp;P 500 components in the coming years, adding that the revenue growth gap between companies in the sector and others is expected to be substantially smaller.""That exceptionalism of technology is arguably behind us,"" Kostin said.For the 10-year period from 2010 to 2021, revenue generated by tech giants compounded annually at a rate of 18%, per Goldman’s data – a return Kostin called ""extraordinary.""“Looking forward, the premium sales growth that was the characteristic most closely associated with mega-cap tech firms for the past decade has compressed dramatically,” Kostin and his team wrote in a recent note.A year ago, these four technology giants traded at an enterprise value/sales multiple – a ratio that compares the value of a company to its sales – of 7x versus 4x for the rest of the companies in the S&amp;P 500. The difference between these names and the broad market has narrowed to 4x compared to 2x.The premium valuation investors are assigning to the market's biggest tech firms has dropped sharply in the last year. (Source: Goldman Sachs)Kostin also pointed to the two years after the March 2000 Tech Bubble as an instructive parallel for the current environment given that the period showed the four largest U.S. companies at the time posted half the sales growth that had been expected.This time around, the tide turned for Big Tech behemoths — and the tech sector more broadly — as the Federal Reserve moved away from the easy-money policies that fueled investor enthusiasm while embarking on an aggressive monetary tightening campaign to rein in inflation.Technology stocks, which are especially vulnerable to higher interest rates, have borne the brunt of the Fed-induced rout across U.S. equity markets in 2022.Story continuesApple, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Meta Platforms (META) have lost around $3 trillion in market value this year, according to Bloomberg data.A year ago, the aggregate market capitalization of the current ""tetrad of largest stocks,"" as Goldman Sachs puts it, comprised 22% of the S&amp;P 500. In the past 12 months, that share has fallen to 18%, with the top four stocks returning an aggregate -25% compared to -13% for the remaining stocks in the index.The four largest stocks in the market have seen their collective weight in the S&amp;P 500 drop by four percentage points in the last two years, though this still remains elevated relative to history. (Source: Goldman Sachs)These struggles have also prompted hiring freezes and layoffs among these names.Goldman notes the consensus expectation for annual sales growth for these four top stocks from 2021-24 stands at 9%, only slightly higher than the 7% expected for the rest of the market. Waning sales growth for these mega-cap stocks has, in turn, been accompanied by a contraction in the premium investors ascribe to these names as well.Across broader markets, Goldman Sachs sees the S&amp;P 500 end around flat in 2023, muted by zero earnings growth.“​​The performance of U.S. stocks in 2022 was all about a painful valuation de-rating, but the equity story for 2023 will be about the lack of corporate earnings growth,” Goldman analysts wrote. “Put simply, zero earnings growth will drive zero appreciation in the stock market.”A one way sign is seen in front of Meta (formerly Facebook) corporate headquarters in Menlo Park, California on November 09, 2022.

Raymond James, MKM Partners and Baird all raised their view earlier this month. Currently, 76% of analysts recommend buying the stock, compared with 57% at the start of the month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The growing optimism about Activision comes despite questions over whether Microsoft’s deal will close. The acquisition faces an in-depth European Union probe and scrutiny from US regulators.Read more: Microsoft’s Activision Deal Hangs on Long-Shot FTC Accord“The market is undervaluing ATVI relative to both outcomes,” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald, referring to whether Microsoft’s $69 billion deal will close. Truist analysts led by Matthew Thornton said that the stock has an attractive risk profile, adding that Activision should have a “big” 2023, given the health of its Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises.The Bloomberg consensus rating on the stock -- a ratio of its buy, hold and sell ratings -- has jumped to 4.52 out of five, its highest since January, and up from an April low of 3.94. This has made Activision nearly as well liked among Wall Street analysts as Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., which boasts a consensus rating of 4.57. Additionally, Electronic Arts Inc. has a consensus rating of 4.29.Story continuesShares of Activision rose 1.6% to $74.61 on Monday, more than 20% below Microsoft’s offer to buy it for $95 per share.Since the takeover was announced in January, the gap between Activision’s trading price and Microsoft’s all-cash bid has been widening, driven by mounting antitrust concerns, as well as its sheer transaction size and long closing process.The deal’s so-called merger arbitrage spread widened last week after Politico reported that the FTC is likely to file an antitrust lawsuit to block the sale. The market was pricing in roughly 40% odds of the deal successfully closing, Cowen’s merger arbitrage specialist Aaron Glick said on Friday.--With assistance from Yiqin Shen.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTikTok’s Viral Challenges Keep Luring Young Kids to Their DeathsCar Price Divergence Hints at More Painful Inflation AheadThe Avatar Sequel Is a Make-or-Break Moment for Disney’s $71 Billion Fox DealGlobal Debt Costs Are Soaring.

Offering remedies before such a document is issued could shorten the regulatory process.""Ultimately, such a move could secure an early clearance with the European Commission and subsequently be used by the parties before other antitrust agencies,"" said Stephane Dionnet, a partner at law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery.""However, it remains to be seen whether the active complainants will validate such concessions (in particular in terms of scope) and if behavioural remedies will also be accepted by the CMA and the FTC,"" he said, referring to the UK and U.S. antitrust agencies.Microsoft's remedy would consist mainly of a 10-year licensing deal to Playstation owner Sony, another person with direct knowledge said.Activision shares were up 2% after the Reuters story was published.The EU competition watchdog, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by April 11, and Sony declined to comment.Microsoft said it was working with the Commission to address valid marketplace concerns.""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about Call of Duty, but we've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation. We want people to have more access to games, not less,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.The deal has been cleared unconditionally in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Serbia.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey, Lisa Shumaker and David Evans)]"

(NASDAQ:WBA) share price has gained 16% in the last three months. But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 42% in that half decade.While the last five years has been tough for Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. See our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Walgreens Boots Alliance actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 5.7% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.We note that the dividend has remained healthy, so that wouldn't really explain the share price drop. It's not immediately clear to us why the stock price is down but further research might provide some answers.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalgreens Boots Alliance is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Walgreens Boots Alliance stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Walgreens Boots Alliance the TSR over the last 5 years was -30%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Walgreens Boots Alliance shares lost 5.0% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 17%. What is more upsetting is the 5% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. This sort of share price action isn't particularly encouraging, but at least the losses are slowing. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

65,f6b7afe2-65d1-3db2-b30b-6f66faf0c5e6,SBUX,2022-11-29,11 Biggest Malls in Europe,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-biggest-malls-europe-232713328.html,1669678033,STORY,"['WMT', 'AAPL', 'TGT', 'AMZN', 'GPS', 'SBUX']","[In this article, we take a look at the 11 biggest malls in Europe. You can skip our detailed analysis of the European mall industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Malls in Europe.Market OutlookThe European retail industry is valued at $3.6 trillion as of 2021 according to Statista. There are roughly 10,000 malls in Europe as of 2021, with the United Kingdom taking the biggest share with over 1,500 malls, per their report. The European mall industry’s economic outlook is not very different from those of other regions when it comes to the mall's traditional purpose. Malls in general are declining in popularity, owing to factors like E-Commerce. The online sales already make up 15% of total shopping in most of Europe. The average retail growth is around 4% while online sales grow by an average of a far higher 20%. In fact, the pandemic lockdowns accelerated the E-Commerce growth to 43% in 2020, adding massive amount of value to stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).Moreover, the persistent inflation around the world and the central banks' rate hikes in response have put the mall industry on a slippery slope, as consumers cut back on spending. This has led European REITs to start adapting to a changing shopping landscape. An Adapting IndustryOne of the ways the industry is adapting is extended diversification, with European malls adding more and more experience and service-based incentives, like museums, art galleries, government offices and theme parks etc.  Florencio Beccar, the fund manager of CBRE Global Investors' European Shopping Center Fund, was quoted by NBC News at the purchase of a German mall that came with a medical facility. He said that purchasing malls with services like medical facilities and others is a major advantage to offset decline in physical retail.In addition to that, many REITs are moving towards logistics, which is another way the European mall industry is trying to adapt and survive. According to CBRE research, every $1 billion addition in online sales requires an additional space of 1.3 million square feet in warehouses, raising the demand for fulfillment centers. Story continuesInsofar as Europe is concerned, a Prologis report showed that every additional 1 billion euros in online sales resulted in an average increase in warehouse demand of almost 72,000 square meters in Britain, Germany, and France, during the studied period of 2007-2012. Logistics also has a cost advantage. Retail space costs around $20 per square foot while the same for logistics costs only $6.5. Its yield is also two percentage points higher on average than retail. This has resulted in malls across the world in general and malls in Europe in particular, attempting to transition and rezone the spare retail spaces in their buildings for the logistics business.Simon Hope, the global head of capital markets for the UK-based property consultant Savills, confirmed the trend with NBC News, saying, “logistics is the new retail.”Key PlayersThere are thousands of malls in Europe but some of the most prominent names in the industry are Mega Belaya Dacha in Russia, Westfield Centro in Germany, Bluewater in the UK and Istanbul Cevahir in Turkey. As far as mall-owning REITs are concerned, Klépierre SA (OTCMKTS:KLPEF) is the biggest mall owner in Europe. It owns 155 malls across 16 European countries.Now that we know the state of the mall industry in Europe, let’s move on to the 11 biggest malls in Europe. 11 Biggest Malls in EuropePixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor our list of the 11 biggest malls in Europe, we’d be ranking them based on their total area. We’ve gotten the data from the malls’ websites. We’d also be discussing factors like total retail space, number of retail stores and restaurants, as well as number of anchor tenants etc. 11.

(NYSE:DIS) had suddenly and unexpectedly fired its CEO, Bob Chapek, and was bringing back former CEO, Robert Iger shook the business world. Chapek’s tenure running Disney lasted barely two years and was tumultuous as the company navigated its way through the Covid-19 crisis when its theme parks were forced to close and its movies were held out of theatres. And with Disney+ not expected to deliver a profitable quarter until fiscal 2024, DIS stock has sunk 38% in 2022. The upheaval at Disney has shone a light on the problems companies often have with succession planning.  Here are three stocks that have suffered at the hands of new CEOs.AMZNAmazon$95FDXFedEx$175.25SBUXStarbucks$99Amazon (AMZN)An image of pills surrounding the Amazon (AMZN( logo representing ONEM stock.Source: MACH Photos / Shutterstock.comRemember Jeff Bezos? With Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock down 45% this year, many shareholders wish that the founder and former CEO of the e-commerce giant would return to the helm and right the ship. Amazon’s share price has steadily declined since the giant’s new CEO, Andy Jassy, took the reigns at the Seattle-based online retailer on July 5, 2021. Since the leadership handover, AMZN stock has lost half its value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo be fair, Jassy, whose pay package last year exceeded $200 million, inherited multiple problems at Amazon.Coming out of the pandemic, Amazon was too bloated. The company had too many employees, was opening an excessive number of warehouses, and had surplus inventory as consumers returned to in-person shopping.As a result, Amazon has reported a string of disappointing earnings and spent much of this year laying off staff, canceling new projects and focusing on obtaining more content for its Prime streaming service.While many analysts say that Andy Jassy is making the right moves to improve Amazon, there are those who are pining for the return of Jeff Bezos, who is spending most of his time these days running his commercial space company Blue Origin and building a $485 million super yacht.Story continuesPodcast host Scott Galloway recently predicted that Bezos would return to lead Amazon again in much the same way that Bob Iger is leading Disney again.Federal Express (FDX)A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.Source: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.comSince its founding in 1971, shipping and logistics giant Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) had always been led by Fred Smith, a hard charging CEO and Vietnam veteran. Smith and his family built Federal Express from a small, regional logistics company in Memphis, Tennessee into a global powerhouse that today rivals United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) for supremacy in the courier and shipping industry.Not surprisingly, Wall Street watched intently when Smith stepped down earlier this year. His replacement, Raj Subramaniam, has received a lot or scrutiny and media attention since he took over as CEO of FedEx this past summer — and not in a good way.  Subramaniam came out of the gates strong, announcing that he was raising the quarterly dividend by 53%.FDX stock jumped 14% in one day on that news. However, the new CEO’s honeymoon with investors was short-lived.In September, FDX stock fell 21% in a single trading day after the company withdrew its earnings guidance, citing worsening business conditions. Subramaniam said weakness in Asia and ongoing issues in Europe were hurting FedEx’s business.Consequently, FedEx pulled its previous earnings guidance and reported preliminary results that were well below Wall Street’s forecasts. Earnings for the company’s fiscal first quarter were projected to be $3.44 a share, far below the $5.10 average estimate of analysts, according to Refinitiv data.More recently, FedEx announced that it is cutting costs and increasing the fees it charges as it seeks to achieve $2.7 billion of savings. Specifically, FedEx said that it plans to eliminate flights, cancel infrastructure projects, and close offices as  thedemand for its services wanes amid a global economic slowdown. The company also raised its shipping rates to boost its revenue.FedEx said it would reduce the frequency of its flights and park many of its cargo jets. The company is also shuttering package sorting facilities and corporate offices.In 2022, FDX stock is down 32% and currently trades at $175.25 a share. Since Subramaniam became CEO on June 1 of this year, the share price has fallen 20%.Starbucks (SBUX)the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shopSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been in turmoil since former CEO Kevin Johnson retired this past March. The departure of Johnson led legendary former CEO Howard Schultz to return as interim CEO of Starbucks in a similar arrangement as the one which Disney announced with Bob Iger.This fall, Schultz named Laxman Narasimhan as the new, permanent CEO of Starbucks. Narasimhan is now shadowing Schultz in the top job and will officially takeover as CEO in April 2023.Schultz’s return as interim CEO (his third stint running Starbucks) has been rocky. On his first day back at the Seattle-based coffee giant, Schultz cancelled the company’s $20 billion stock buyback program, saying he wanted to reinvest SBUX’s profits directly in its business.A few weeks later, he eliminated the role of chief operating officer (COO) entirely as the retail coffee chain restructures its business. This came as the company continues to battle slowing sales abroad, particularly in China where ongoing Covid-19 lockdowns remain an issue, and combats an aggressive unionization drive across its network of nearly 9,000 coffee shops in the U.S.The moves by Schultz and the problems afflicting Starbucks have led to a 15% decline of SBUX stock this year. The shares currently trade at just under $100. The announcement that Laxman Narasimhan would take control as the permanent CEO next spring has done nothing to help the stock recover.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. LW, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA, HF Sinclair Corp. DINO and Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Top Growth Stocks to Gain from a Likely Year-End RallyJust 25 days of trading are left to complete 2022, which has been rather disappointing. Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been further complicated by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 5.9%, 15.5% and 27.9%, respectively.However, recently released several inflation data for October have shown that peak inflation may be behind us. The Fed's November FOMC minutes revealed that the majority of officials prefer a relatively dovish-monetary stance going forward.As the Fed is expected to lower the magnitude of its rate hike in the December FOMC meeting, we may witness a year-end rally in Wall Street, which is likely to boost growth stocks. To tap a possible gain, we have selected five growth stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These are — Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Lamb Weston Holdings Inc., LPL Financial Holdings Inc., HF Sinclair Corp. and Steel Dynamics Inc..Wall Street Likely to See a Year-End RallyAlthough the Fed is yet to signal any shift from its ultra-hawkish monetary policies, a section of Fed officials has recently spoken in a relatively dovish tone. The minutes of the Fed's November FOMC meeting revealed that a ""substantial majority"" of Fed officials favor reducing the magnitude of the interest rate hike going forward.Story continuesThe FOMC minute stated ""A number of participants observed that, as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve the Committee's goals, it would become appropriate to slow the pace of increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.""The Fed has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 3.75% so far in 2022 with a 75 basis-point rise in the last four FOMC meetings. At present, the Fed fund rate is within the range of 3.75-4%. At present, per the CME FedWatch, there exists a 75.8% probability that the central bank will reduce the magnitude of rate hike to 50 basis points in December FOMC.In his post-FOMC statement in November, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the terminal interest rate may go beyond 5% as estimated earlier and a soft landing of the economy may not be realized. However, with several important Fed officials recently expressing their dovish views, market participants are unsure of whether the terminal interest rate will cross the 5% threshold or stay below that.Moreover,  U.S. GDP grew 2.6% in the third quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 2.2%. This is important because the economy contracted in the first two quarters of this year, compelling a large section of economists and financial experts to warn of a recession. Additionally, despite several major headwinds, the overall management guidance in the third-quarter 2022 earnings season was fairly good.Off late, Wall Street has seen a strong rally since mid-October. We believe, that supported by above-mentioned positives, the rally will is likely to strengthen and extend throughout the rest of this year.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) growth stocks that have solid upside left for the rest of 2022.

Price and EPS SurpriseSynopsys, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSynopsys, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteFactors Ahead of Q4 ResultsDuring fiscal fourth-quarter, the increasing global design activity and customer engagements are likely to have been Synopsys’ growth drivers.  Its Q4 performance is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for its solid product portfolio.Growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI), fifth-generation (5G), the Internet of Things, high-performance computing, the Cloud and automotive is anticipated to have boosted demand for Synopsys’ advanced solutions during the fourth quarter fiscal 2022. The company is likely to have gained from growth in Custom Compiler, which is fueled by the large deal wins in the 5G, AI and server chip markets.The ongoing shift to high-performance cloud computing due to the growing hybrid working environment is expected to have aided demand for the company’s Intellectual Property (IP) solutions, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express 5.0 &amp; 6.0, 800G Ethernet and DDR5 memory.Strong adoption of interface and foundation IP solutions are likely to have boosted revenues for SNPS’s interface portfolio. Additionally, widespread contract wins and the increasing deployment of the Fusion Platform, including Fusion Compiler, might drive the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter results.Story continuesSynopsys’ partnership with industry leaders like Microsoft and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is expected to have accelerated the deployment of its cloud solutions, which might have aided the company’s top line during the quarter under review.The company’s solid electronic design automation software partner base, which includes Advanced Micro Devices, Juniper Networks, Realtek, Toshiba and Wolfson, is likely to have served as a major revenue driver.Increased design investments in Synopsys’ ARC processors by automotive companies are an upside. Besides, strong adoption of security solutions for interfaces such as PCI Express, CXL and DDR, with over 30 design wins across all market segments, is a positive.However, component supply constraints are also expected to have partially offset the benefits of the aforementioned factors. Apart from this, the heightening competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems might have played a spoilsport.What Our Model StatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Synopsys this season.

The holiday weekend just ended was the first in three years not overshadowed by COVID-19 and associated public health measures.Even so, the number was still more than 11% below the comparable figure three years ago, at the last pre-COVID Thanksgiving weekend, when 2.88 million passengers were screened.By 09:45 ET (14:45 GMT), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock was down 1.8%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock were both down 1.6%. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was down 1.1%.While the numbers confirmed the gradual recovery of domestic air travel, their inability to break 2019's record is testimony to the pressure on consumers' wallets in a year when airlines have put their prices up ferociously to exploit pent-up demand. Fares are up around 30% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data.Long-haul airlines also had to deal with a headwind from a different direction on Monday. Having been supported in the last couple of weeks by hopes that the reopening of China's air corridors would boost business, the sector was among the most directly exposed to fears of political instability and further economic damage arising from the authorities' reversal of course in recent days, doubling down on the Zero COVID strategy that has been in place for nearly three years.Related ArticlesAirline stocks struggle despite strong holiday travel numbersPoland's CD Projekt third-quarter profit soars thanks to Cyberpunk boostIKEA store owner eyes more price cuts as some input costs ease]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group How Fast Is TransDigm Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Even modest earnings per share growth (EPS) can create meaningful value, when it is sustained reliably from year to year. So EPS growth can certainly encourage an investor to take note of a stock. TransDigm Group's EPS shot up from US$10.39 to US$14.33; a result that's bound to keep shareholders happy. That's a commendable gain of 38%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. TransDigm Group shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 37% to 41%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for TransDigm Group.Are TransDigm Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of TransDigm Group, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$288m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.8% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesIs TransDigm Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that TransDigm Group has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in TransDigm Group's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for TransDigm Group that you should be aware of.Although TransDigm Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

73,0bc22b50-d0e9-368d-8283-df8708ca0267,SPG,2022-11-29,3 Top REITs to Buy From the Rebound in Retail REIT Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-reits-buy-rebound-142202522.html,1669645322,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'SPG', 'KIM']","[The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry constituents are poised to benefit from the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime. Efforts to support omni-channel retailing, adaptive reuse capabilities and opportunities emanating from consolidations, and focus on e-commerce resistant sectors have poised Simon Property Group, Inc. SPG, Kimco Realty Corporation KIM and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. SKT well for growth.However, inflationary pressure and economic slowdown might cast a pall on recovery. Rising borrowing costs and labor market pessimism are likely to weigh down on consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent. Also, higher e-commerce adoption might continue to affect retail landlords’ cash flows.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry embodies a group of REITs engaged in owning, developing, managing and renting space in a variety of retail real estates. Among these are regional malls, outlet centers, grocery-anchored shopping centers and power centers, including big-box retailers. Also, net lease REITs enjoy the ownership of freestanding properties, wherein both rent and the majority of operating expenses for the properties are borne by the tenants. The overall health of the economy, job market and consumer spending are the main drivers of retail REITs while property locations and trade area demographics play key roles in demand determination. Although dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies were bothering this asset category in the past, it is on its recovery on shoppers’ renewed enthusiasm for an in-person shopping experience.What's Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry?Renewed Enthusiasm for In-Store Shopping Experience to Fuel Recovery: This industry is poised to benefit from the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers as they look for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime. As such, the landlords remain upbeat about the ongoing holiday shopping season. Also, the optimistic view of retailers for long-term growth is likely to act as a tailwind. Amid this, retailers’ focus has now shifted from the closing of stores to the revival of their growth plans, resulting in more demand for physical store spaces and paving the way for the retail REITs to experience gains in leasing activity, pricing power and flourish. Moreover, retailers are focusing on investments in their stores because apart from serving as showrooms, physical stores offer a convenient location for pick-up or exchange of goods, helping retailers counter the increasing costs associated with last-mile delivery.Limited New Supply and Rapid Formation of New businesses to Drive Leasing: Comparing to the pre-pandemic levels, the construction of new retail space remains dreary. Moreover, lease signings, rent and occupancies in retail real estates are likely to get a boost from limited new supply, the waning of pandemic concerns and the rapid formation of new businesses in the retail sector.Omni-Channel Strategy, Structural Changes in Focus: Omni-channel is the focal point for retailers. Physical stores will be a vital sales channel over the long run because though there is convenience in online shopping, it cannot replace the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store. This is quite evident from the recent foot traffic at retail destinations. Moreover, digitally-native brands are likely to keep boosting their physical presence in the days to come as part of the omni-channel strategy since the opening of stores helps them to improve their connection with customers and drive expansion. In fact, for retailers, the focus now is not only on increasing their online presence but also on maintaining brick-and-mortar stores in the best locations, which in turn is raising hopes for retail REITs that focus on such locations. Also, with the waning impact of the pandemic, entertainment and dining concepts are seeing a revival, boosting retail REITs’ growth opportunities.Repurposing and Conversions Pick Up Pace: Retail REITs are now focusing on adaptive reuse, which includes multifamily, hotel, office and medical components, resulting in the construction of mixed-use real estate destinations. In fact, the mixed-use development option has gained immense popularity in recent years as it helps to catch the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area. Moreover, the open-air format and pick-up concepts have been helping landlords to lure tenants. Also, the conversion of malls into distribution hubs has accelerated as these distribution centers, being situated close to consumers of retailers, facilitate faster delivery of products and aid retailers in improving services, lower costs and make optimum asset utilization.Inflationary Pressure, Economic Slowdown Cast a Pall on Recovery: Higher material and operating costs remain a concern for the retailers and this, in turn, might cast a pall on their landlords’ cash flows. Moreover, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings, rising borrowing costs and labor market pessimism is likely to weigh down on consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent.Higher E-commerce Adoption to Remain a Concern: Consumers’ habits have transformed at a rapid pace over the past years and traffic at retail real estates has suffered, with e-commerce capturing market share from brick-and-mortar stores. With the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. Yet, given the convenience it offers, online shopping is likely to remain a popular choice among customers. This might adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

(HOLX) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-hologic-inc-holx-140002093.html,1669644002,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned +12%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has gained 7.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -59.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.46 points to a change of -42.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 indicates a change of +12.5% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $962.24 million indicates a year-over-year change of -34.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.81 billion and $4.04 billion estimates indicate -21.6% and +5.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $953.3 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.6%. EPS of $0.82 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $866.83 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.98%. The EPS surprise was +32.26%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

87,f692b930-6cdd-348b-b5b8-28f6f1dd54b2,NFLX,2022-11-29,Winners and losers at the box office over Thanksgiving weekend,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/winners-losers-box-office-over-215733598.html,1669672653,VIDEO,"['DIS', 'NFLX']","[Yahoo Finance entertainment reporter Allie Canal breaks down the box office return from Thanksgiving weekend releases, including ""Glass Onion: A Knives Out Story"" and Marvel's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"".Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- That Thanksgiving holiday, though, can be a good time to head to theaters with the whole family, Allie. And who are the winners and losers this weekend box office trip? We got four days in there. I don't know how they're counting them, but lots of excitement.ALLIE CANAL: Lots of excitement, but more losers than there are winners. But I'll start with the good news, right? Let's start with the winners. One winner definitely has to be ""Knives Out, Glass Onion.""That sequel is a Netflix streaming exclusive, however, we did have this theatrical one for one week, only 600 theaters. So it wasn't even available in every single state or city. Yet despite that, reports have it pegged between 12-15 million over the 5-day holiday period. Now, Netflix did not release these figures.This is all based on reporting. Netflix said it will not be releasing the official box office numbers. Perhaps that will change considering the success here, but it begs the question of whether this film should have had a longer theatrical release. Whether Netflix should reevaluate its relationship with the box office and perhaps roll out more of these films for a longer period of time. So that was a winner.Then we had Disney, which was a winner and a loser. We had ""Wakanda Forever"" in its third weekend consistently doing well, yet again, another 64 million over the 5-day. But then its animated film, ""Strange World"", despite an A-list cast that included one of my faves, Jake Gyllenhaal, that only grossed 18.6 million over the 5-day, and this movie is set to lose $100 million over its theatrical run. And Disney certainly not happy about that, especially considering all the problems of that company is going through right now.Story continuesOther films like ""Devotion"" And ""Menu Bones"" and all, all grossing below 10 million and it was just a very disappointing Thanksgiving holiday. Even less than what we saw last year when there were less movies out. So it's going to be interesting to see how the holiday season does at the box office and going into the first quarter of 2023.- Originally thought it was a terrible idea for Netflix, just being honest. But it looked like it succeeded and that it makes a lot of people want to see that once it's on Netflix. Gave it a lot more attention than it would have had otherwise.So it looks like a success. Allie Canal, thank you. Good stuff.]"

Because in a surprising twist, Netflix had a strong showing at the domestic box office over the long Thanksgiving weekend. But is the movie business close to a full recovery? Hmm, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the details on that. Allie, um-- no.ALEXANDRA CANAL: No, no, and of course, the one streaming title is the surprise of the weekend. But if we take a step back and look at the overall box office, it really did disappoint. The box office totals grossed just under $93 million for the three-day, $133 million for the five-day. That's below expectations and, obviously, well below what we saw even last year when there weren't a lot of movies out, in addition to pre-pandemic levels in 2019.But if we zone in on probably the one good thing here, ""Knives Out, Glass Onion,"" that was a limited box office release, only 600 theaters in total. Wasn't even available in every single state or city. That estimated between 12 million to 15 million in its five-day gross. Now that's based on a variety of reports Netflix has said that it will not be releasing the exact box office figures. We'll see if that changes. They could potentially change their mind, given the success we saw here. But again, that's not nothing. And that's pretty significant.Now, there were a few other bright spots when we think about some of the other movies that were out this past weekend. ""Black Panther, Wakanda Forever,"" this was in its third weekend, but it grossed an additional 64 million over the five-day, so one good thing for Disney. But then one bad thing for Disney with the animated film ""Strange World,"" despite that A-list cast, only grossing $18.6 million. It's estimated to lose $100 million in its theatrical run. So not something that Disney wants to see right now in the midst of all of their problems.Story continuesAnd then ""Devotion,"" ""The Menu,"" ""Bones and All,"" under $10 million. So, you know, this wasn't a great Thanksgiving for the box office. And it should be interesting to see, as we head into the Christmas season, as we head into the first quarter of 2023, how things could potentially change.BRAD SMITH: What does this signal to us for some of the titles that have been able to go to theaters, but then also make their way directly to or to streaming in a more condensed time frame? You know, what does that signal to us about where the production house is and where the different streaming platforms may have to create even more of that kind of symbiosis going forward from here, knowing where the viewers are either staying or where they may be returning to some movie experience?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and it's an interesting question that I think all of the studios are grappling with. We heard last week that Amazon is going to spend $1 billion to produce 12 to 14 movies exclusively for theaters. That's based on a report from Bloomberg. So that could symbolize that maybe some of these streaming giants do want to see or experiment, at least, a little bit with the box office to see how that could add to profits.But in the same vein, with something like a ""Knives Out"" sequel that Netflix spent $450 million on to secure the next two iterations of that franchise, it begs the question, shouldn't Netflix have done a longer theatrical run? Could you imagine if it was in the 4,000 plus theaters that the rest of those movies were in and not just the 600 million? Maybe that could have been something that Netflix needs to explore, especially as that company has also struggled with free cash flow and profitability. So I think we're going to get more answers and more experimentation in 2023 when it comes to all this.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, bottom line, my couch is pretty darn comfortable.BRAD SMITH: That's right.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And that's the thing.JULIE HYMAN: And I know that ""Knives Out"" is coming eventually. I know that ""Strange World"" is coming eventually, right? And-- I don't know.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And I feel it with myself, too. I'm getting a little lazy when it comes to the movies that I want to go out to the theater and see. There's a ton that I'm down, oh, that I'm browsing on my TV on my couch. I'm saying, great, this movie is now available from the comfort of my own home. I'm going to watch it. And I think consumers are getting a little more picky. So if consumer behavior is changing, how does that change the way we think about the box office and the movies we produce?JULIE HYMAN: Good questions. Allie, yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thanks very much.JULIE HYMAN: Don't have the answers, but we will eventually.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Gas Stocks To Buy Now. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the shortage of natural gas, further hiking up prices for consumers and businesses alike. This resulted in the use of alternative fuels and demand destruction. It also creates longer-term unpredictably in the natural gas market, especially in emerging nations where it used to play a primary role in energy transitions. According to the International Energy Agency, the Asia Pacific region and the industrial sector are the core drivers of growth in the natural gas market, accounting for 50% and 60% of the growth to 2025, respectively. However, the Asia Pacific region will be subject to high risk from rising prices and slow economic growth.As per IEA data, gas production in North America rose by 2.1% in 2021 although there was limited capital expenditure in the US upstream sector, driven by higher domestic and export demand. Per IEA’s estimates, North America holds a leading position in the intermediate-term in the global growth of natural gas supply, with nearly 85 bcm added between 2021 and 2025. The region represents nearly 40% of the net increase in production capacity and over half of the worldwide net production growth during 2021 and 2025. Some of the best gas stocks to invest in include ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC). Our Methodology We selected the following gas stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and solidity of dividend profiles.

We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”7. Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) is a Canadian integrated energy company focused on exploring, producing, and marketing crude oil, natural gas, byproducts, refined products, and power. On November 16, Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) declared a C$0.52 per share quarterly dividend, a 10.6% increase from its prior dividend of C$0.47. The dividend is payable on December 23, to shareholders of record on December 2.

(NYSE:SU) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to C$60 from C$63. Analyst William Janela issued the ratings update. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) was part of 45 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 47 in the earlier quarter. Paul Singer’s Elliott Management is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 10 million shares worth $281.6 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments International Growth ADR Strategy has to say about Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “Also within the structural bucket, we added to our commodity exposure with the purchase of Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU). Suncor, a past holding, is a Canadian integrated oil company where we capitalized on attractive valuation due to a COVID-19-induced slowdown. We expect recovery in oil demand and strong pricing will result in faster than expected free cash flow growth and financial deleveraging.The structural bucket has the shortest investment horizon across the spectrum of growth companies we target in the Strategy. We closely monitor the macro impacts and turnaround progress of these companies and will be disciplined sellers when the thesis for a holding plays out.”6.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Marathon Petroleum MPC, Phillips 66 PSX, Murphy USA MUSA and PBF Energy PBF.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Time to Get Bullish on These 4 Oil Refining and Marketing StocksThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry continues to benefit from strength in fundamentals, strong margins and robust fuel demand. As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, the downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, reefing and marketing firms likeMarathon Petroleum, Phillips 66,Murphy USA and PBF Energy have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products.Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureStrong Refined Products Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 4% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.Story continuesAs economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid the post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2022. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Attractive Margins: The industry's improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs earlier this year.While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high. Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Higher Costs &amp; Inflationary Pressures: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #25, which places it in the top 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. While the industry's earnings estimates for 2022 have increased 159.7% in the past year, the same for 2023 have risen 143.2% over the same timeframe.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 45% over this period compared with the broader sector's increase of 31.4%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 15.8%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.35X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 12.22X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.39X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.67X.4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMarathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States.

As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, the downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, reefing and marketing firms like Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66, Murphy USA and PBF Energy have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products.Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureSrong Refined Products Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 4% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.Story continuesAs economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid the post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2022. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Attractive Margins: The industry's improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs earlier this year. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high.Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Higher Costs &amp; Inflationary Pressures: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #25, which places it in the top 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. While the industry's earnings estimates for 2022 have increased 159.7% in the past year, the same for 2023 have risen 143.2% over the same timeframe.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 45% over this period compared with the broader sector's increase of 31.4%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 15.8%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.35X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 12.22X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.39X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.67X.4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMarathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States.

94,729bb432-dcf4-3f7b-bbb1-cf2986d4afdd,TJX,2022-11-29,Some Investors May Be Worried About TJX Companies' (NYSE:TJX) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-may-worried-tjx-companies-110012237.html,1669719612,STORY,['TJX'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So while TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for TJX Companies:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$4.6b ÷ (US$28b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, TJX Companies has an ROCE of 27%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Specialty Retail industry average of 18%. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for TJX Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for TJX Companies.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at TJX Companies, we didn't gain much confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 46%, but they have dropped over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom Line On TJX Companies' ROCETo conclude, we've found that TJX Companies is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 123% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesOn a final note, we found  2 warning signs for TJX Companies (1 is significant)  you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:AMGN) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Amgen as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Amgen.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Amgen would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 28% last year. However, this wasn't enough as the latest three year period has seen a very unpleasant 2.2% drop in EPS in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 11% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Amgen's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On Amgen's P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.We've established that Amgen maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for Amgen that you need to take into consideration.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Amgen, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

The cartel is set to meet on December 4, its last meeting for the year, to decide on production.Brent oil futures jumped nearly 1% to $84.09 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures were flat around $77.27 a barrel by 21:09 ET (02:09 GMT).Oil prices are currently trading below the levels that spurred October’s supply cut by the OPEC, driving up hopes that the cartel will cut production when it meets this Sunday.The OPEC announced a 2 million barrel per day supply cut in October to drive up prices, which had briefly put oil close to $100 a barrel.But concerns over weakening demand, swiftly pulled back prices, driving them to a 11-month low in recent sessions. Rising U.S. interest rates and waning demand in China were the biggest headwinds to oil markets this year, while strength in the dollar also made crude shipments more expensive for major importers.Hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve on Monday drove up the dollar and indicated pressure on the U.S. economy, which could dent its appetite for crude. Fed members James Bullard and John Williams both said on Monday that the central bank will likely begin trimming rates well into 2024, and that more rate hikes were warranted to combat inflation.Anti-government protests in China now raise the prospect of more economic disruption in the world’s largest crude importer. But some analysts argued that the protests could also push the government into relaxing its strict anti-COVID measures, which is the target of the protestors.Story continuesChina is grappling with its worst COVID outbreak ever, which could see the government remain hesitant over relaxing its zero-COVID policy.

He also reiterated his view that rates need to rise by at least another 1% to between 5% and 5.25%.Separately, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said the central bank will likely begin trimming rates in 2024, as inflation pressures eventually ease. He also said that borrowing costs need to rise further to bring down inflation.Their comments boosted the dollar, with the greenback jumping nearly 0.7% on Monday. This weighed on most metal markets, particularly gold.Spot gold was flat around $1,741.33 an ounce, while gold futures expiring in December traded around $1,740.00 an ounce, remaining in backwardation. Both instruments sank around 0.6% on Monday.While Bullard and Williams’ comments provided some more clarity on U.S. monetary policy, they also dimmed optimism over a slower pace of rate hikes by the Fed in the coming months, given that rates will likely peak at much higher levels.This paints a dour picture for non-yielding assets such as gold, which fell sharply this year as U.S. rates began rising.Gold saw little safe haven demand this week, even as unprecedented civil unrest in China raised concerns over global economic disruptions.Copper, on the other hand, marked a volatile start to the week, sinking as much as 2% before recovering sharply to trade higher.The outlook for the red metal was dulled by the protests in China, which could further hamper the country’s appetite for commodities. Chinese citizens in several major cities took to the streets over the weekend to express their discontent with the country’s draconian zero-COVID policy.Story continuesCopper futures were steady around $3.6018 a pound in early trade on Tuesday.But some analysts opined that the protests in China may eventually push the government into relaxing its zero-COVID policy, which is at the heart of China’s economic slowdown this year. Such a scenario is likely to be positive for commodity markets.On the supply side, reports suggested that workers at Chile’s massive Escondida copper mine will not go on strike, reducing the prospect of tight supply in the coming months.Related ArticlesGold sinks below $1,750 on hawkish Fed comments, copper steadyOil prices slide on concerns over China's demandU.S. seeks to limit flaring and methane leaks from public lands drilling]"

105,54f8fc2f-51f9-37c5-b284-3edab769b871,GD,2022-11-29,General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) investors will be pleased with their favorable 52% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-nyse-gd-investors-130106373.html,1669726866,STORY,['GD'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) shareholders have seen the share price rise 41% over three years, well in excess of the market return (24%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 32% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, General Dynamics achieved compound earnings per share growth of 1.6% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, General Dynamics' TSR for the last 3 years was 52%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that General Dynamics shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 7%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

(NYSE:NOV),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-nov-inc-101645770.html,1669717005,STORY,['NOV'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for NOV What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$294.0mUS$526.5mUS$656.0mUS$759.0mUS$834.7mUS$898.0mUS$950.9mUS$995.8mUS$1.03bUS$1.07bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 9.98%Est @ 7.58%Est @ 5.9%Est @ 4.72%Est @ 3.9%Est @ 3.32% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$266US$431US$486US$509US$506US$493US$472US$448US$421US$393(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.4bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (11%– 2.0%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$4.7bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$9.1b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$21.8, the company appears about fair value at a 6.3% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NOV as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.664. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For NOV, there are three important items you should assess:Risks: You should be aware of the 2 warning signs for NOV we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for NOV's future outlook? Check out our management and board analysis with insights on CEO compensation and governance factors.Other Solid Businesses: Low debt, high returns on equity and good past performance are fundamental to a strong business. Why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals to see if there are other companies you may not have considered!PS.

These are licensed online casino games that use brands to attract users based on their familiarity with popular fictional characters such as Batman.Finally, Global Industry Analysts have the most optimistic take on the gambling industry. It believes that the sector was worth $711 billion in 2020, and from then until 2027 it will grow at a CAGR of 3.6% and be worth a whopping $912 billion in 2027.

The equity has had support from the 20-day moving average since late October, but is now running into a newly formed ceiling at the $80 level. Year-over-year, WYNN is still down 8.7%.It's worth noting short sellers are hitting the exits, though.

We're coming up against that opening bell on Wall Street to kick off this jobs report week. Let's take a look at some stocks moving on the Yahoo Finance platform. First up, casino shares in focus after the Macau government renewed the licenses for six casino operators, including resorts from Wynn, MGM, and Las Vegas Sands.The new licenses are expected to take effect at the beginning of next year and are allowed to carry a maximum term of 10 years according to Macau's gaming law. JP Morgan out with a flash deal on this one, guys, saying this could be a big catalyst for the stocks. They're recommending pretty much buy ratings across the board for the space as a result of this.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, we've seen tremendous growth in terms of post pandemic period where there has been more attention that's been thrust towards gaming, whether that be digitally or whether that be the in-person experience, and particularly for some of the resort operators as we're seeing even this kind of shift in traveler sentiment and how they are spending more money on those experiences versus goods, at least cyclically right now.You wonder where that could continue to move forward or at least kind of set a new benchmark rate that some of the casino operators could count on. But we do know that negotiations-- they're going to continue with some of the winners that got the final contracts. And then also they've got to have some type of investment in nongaming sectors as well, which is going to be an interesting kind of tidbit of this.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, it was pretty expected that they would get this still. It was sort of an overhanging uncertainty. And it's so interesting how these stocks trading today stands in stark contrast-- where this positive sentiment stands in stark contrast to what we're hearing from the mainland. But to put it in perspective here, gaming revenue in Macau is down to a record low of $49 million in July. That is a 98% decline from pre-COVID levels.Story continuesAnd part of the reason is that Macau is so dependent on the Chinese mainland. That's where most of the visitors who come there come from. Chinese-- gambling is still illegal in mainland China. It is not illegal in Macau obviously. And this-- now these new license renewal promises now guarantee that it is going to remain legal in Macau for now at these various casinos.So you know, it's a big deal that they're able to do this. But they're also trying to diversify where the travelers come from to come to Macau. And you know, that'll be an interesting challenge going forward to see if they can attract people from other places.BRIAN SOZZI: This would have been a disaster if they didn't get these license renewals.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, yes.BRIAN SOZZI: These companies have invested billions of dollars over the past decade to put large hotels and properties and tables in these areas. And clearly they needed this.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, Macau gets cited time after time, especially in the earnings calls for companies like Wynn. Wynn actually talking about that within their most recent earnings call as well, saying that the market continues to be challenging, of course, that the current environment. However, these contracts certainly give them some [? leeway ?] going forward from here.They're saying that the unique tourism offering during periods when the market is accessible really is highlighting some of that strong demand that they are forecasting and foreseeing, which really dovetails into how they go about getting these contracts and the competitive environment for making sure that they do get that 10-year time period too. So we'll see exactly where they're able to start to enact some of that as the negotiations start to finalize as well here.]"

114,ab8fbcbf-e95d-30d9-8371-f3bd1b79afad,ZTS,2022-11-29,Calculating The Fair Value Of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-zoetis-inc-120311645.html,1669723391,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Zoetis Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.37bUS$2.78bUS$2.91bUS$3.17bUS$3.37bUS$3.53bUS$3.67bUS$3.80bUS$3.91bUS$4.01bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.11%Est @ 4.87%Est @ 4%Est @ 3.4%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$2.2kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$100bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$100b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$55bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$79b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$148, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, NextEra Energy has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on NextEra Energy will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, NextEra Energy would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 62%. The latest three year period has also seen a 15% overall rise in EPS, aided extensively by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 23% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.0% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why NextEra Energy is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On NextEra Energy's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of NextEra Energy's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 2 warning signs for NextEra Energy (1 is significant!) that we have uncovered.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on NextEra Energy, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

BLK, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. AMP, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. AMG and Prospect Capital Corp. PSEC.Industry: Investment ManagementLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2022173/4-investment-management-stocks-to-watch-in-a-prospering-industryHigher interest rates will benefit the Zacks Investment Management industry stocks, which bore the brunt of low rates during the pandemic. While elevated technology costs might hurt profitability, investment managers' margins will no longer be under pressure given the rate hikes. This should aid revenue growth.Moreover, investment managers have benefited from higher volatility and client activity amid the pandemic. Although markets normalized in second-half 2021, client activity has gained momentum once again. Hence, BlackRock, Inc., Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. and Prospect Capital Corp. should benefit from growth in assets under management (AUM).About the IndustryThe Zacks Investment Management industry consists of companies that manage securities and funds for clients to meet specified investment goals. They earn by charging service fees or commissions. Investment managers are also called asset managers, as they manage hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity, venture capital and other financial investments for third parties.By appointing an investment manager for one's assets, investors get more diversification options than they would have if they managed their assets by themselves. Investment managers invest their clients' assets in different asset classes, depending on their needs and risk-taking abilities. Hence, the diversification, which investors get by appointing asset managers to manage their assets, helps reduce the impact of volatility and ensures steady returns over time.3 Investment Management Industry Trends to ConsiderInterest Rate Hikes to Aid Margin Growth Despite Shift in Preferences: Similar to the past few years, demand for passive investing has been on the rise on the continued need for low-cost investment strategies. Thus, rising demand for passive investments is expected to negatively impact investment managers' margin growth to some extent. Nevertheless, the interest rate hikes since the beginning of this year to tame the raging inflation will likely result in an improvement in margins in the near term. Also, the rise in industry consolidation witnessed since the beginning of 2020 is likely to support bottom-line growth.Story continuesGrowth in AUM Likely to Continue Despite a Volatile Trend in Asset Flows: In 2020 and the first half of 2021, there was a significant rise in equity market volatility and solid client activity, owing to the coronavirus-induced uncertainty, which aided total AUM growth. In the second half of 2021, markets began to normalize, with client activity remaining decent. Nevertheless, the first nine months of 2022 again witnessed an unexpected rise in volatility and relatively higher client activity, resulting in asset inflows for the majority of the industry players.Thus, despite a volatile trend in flows (seen recently), growth in AUM is expected to continue in the near term. Asset managers' top lines are, therefore, expected to improve, supported by higher performance fees and investment advisory fees, which constitute the majority of their revenues.Elevated Costs Remain Concerning: The tightening of regulations to increase transparency has led to a rise in compliance costs for investment managers. Also, as wealth managers are constantly trying to upgrade technology to keep up with evolving customer needs, technology costs are expected to keep rising. These will likely lead to an increase in overall expenses, thus, hurting investment managers' bottom line.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Investment Management industry is a 44-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #89, which places it at the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of bright earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have just started gaining confidence in this group's bottom-line growth potential. The industry's current-year earnings estimates have been revised 1.3% higher since the end of October 2022.Thus, we present a few stocks from the prospering industry that you may want to keep an eye on. But before that, let's check out the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Investment Management industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and its sector in the past two years.Stocks in the industry have collectively lost 2.4%. The S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 9.6% and the Zacks Finance Sector has appreciated 12.2%.Industry's Current ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TB), which is commonly used for valuing finance companies because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TB of 3.90X. This compares with the highest level of 5.27X, the lowest level of 2.04X and the median of 3.59X over the past five years. Additionally, the industry is trading at a significant discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TB for the S&amp;P 500 composite is 10.30X, which the chart below shows.As finance stocks typically have a low P/TB ratio, comparing investment managers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group's P/TB ratio with that of its broader sector seems more meaningful. When we compare the group's P/TB ratio with the broader Finance sector, it seems that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector's trailing 12-month P/TB of 4.69X for the same period is above the Zacks Investment Management industry's ratio.4 Investment Management Stocks to Keep an Eye OnBlackRock: The New York, NY-based Zacks Ranked #3 (Hold) company is the largest asset manager by assets in the United States, with a market capitalization of $110.6 billion.

While its AUM balance declined in the first nine months of 2022 due to the tough operating backdrop amid the macroeconomic concerns, the trend will likely reverse in the future.The company has been continuously strengthening its iShares and exchange-traded funds (ETF) operations. Its efforts to gain market share in the active equity business will likely keep aiding profitability.Supported by a solid balance sheet and liquidity position, BlackRock has expanded via acquisitions, both domestic and overseas. In June 2021, it acquired the Climate Change Scenario Model of Baringa Partners. In February 2021, it completed the acquisition of investment management services provider, Aperio Group.

It constantly modifies its product and service-offering capacity to keep pace with dynamic market needs. This strategy, along with asset growth, has helped the company witness a rise in total net revenues.Moreover, AMP has grown inorganically and restructured its business from time to time to remain profitable by focusing on its core operations. In November 2021, the company acquired BMO Financial Group's EMEA asset management operations, which will bolster its wealth and asset management businesses and global diversification efforts. In July 2021, it closed a deal for RiverSource Life Insurance Company (its insurance subsidiary) with Global Atlantic's subsidiary, Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company, to reinsure $7 billion of fixed deferred and immediate annuity policies.In 2019, it divested the Ameriprise Auto &amp; Home business. These initiatives, along with a few others, are expected to continue supporting revenue growth.

The acquisitions of the majority stakes in Parnassus Investments and Abacus Capital Group, along with the buyouts of minority stakes in OCP Asia, Boston Common Asset Management and Systematica, are steps in this direction.While Affiliated Managers' affiliates have been witnessing overall net outflows over the past few years, the company's differentiated product categories are likely to support cash flows across channels.AMG has appreciated 20.1% over the past three months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2022 earnings has been revised upward by 7.5% to $19.53 per share over the past 30 days.

Both of them going to underweight from equal weight due, Barclays says, to the difficult outlook surrounding protein companies in general, although the downgrade didn't affect all of the protein companies in Barclays coverage there. But they said the worst is yet to come for most of the sector because price-conscious consumers are facing rising prices for a lot of these products as well as rising beef prices. So that's a challenge for some of these companies.- I'm concerned of what the worst is yet to come would mean for Beyond Meat. You could argue they have seen the worst the past year as consumers have traded off that product and traded down to cheaper, regular alternatives, like regular chicken, regular beef. So that's a scary note from Barclays on Beyond and even, to a lesser extent, Tyson.- You know, one of the interesting things-- I was looking back through the beyond earnings report as well, and they're actually down in, for the nine months that we've seen them report for thus far over the course of this fiscal year, they're actually down in every single category across US retail, US food service, and even international retail, food service. So negative-- well, just kind of negative percentages that you've got across the board. So, that is declines across the board there in their revenues.But here's the interesting thing. They're actually up in some of those key categories in terms of the pounds sold by channel, which is interesting because it means that they're actually taking a severe discount for everything that they are producing. So the overproduction met with the lower prices that they're able to off-- or just sell through some of their own inventory that they're creating, that creates a longer term issue if you're Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods because that's a larger demand equation. And they had to cite that within their most recent earnings report as well.Story continuesThey had talked about this on the call, just saying that current economic climate has not been kind to plant based meat. I mean, no crap. But honestly, it really is this question of whether or not this is a transitory period, and everybody hates that word when you hear it on an earnings call. But this doesn't necessarily have the same history in the meat environment in a cyclical or an economic downturn period as some of the more kind of historical meat, if you will historical.- Historical meat. Yeah, I mean, we had tofurkey on our Thanksgiving table--- Legendary meat.- Legendary meat.- OG meat. Classic meat.- --for the vegetarian in our house. But I learned tofurky is made by a privately held company.- Tofurky.- Tofurky. It's not bad, actually. But anyway, it's by privately held company. But we saw Beyond Meat shares just now trading a little bit higher today. But the stock is down 80% year to date.- You have a better idea than me probably, Julie. I saw two Beyond patties in Whole Foods for $5.75. That's pretty good. I mean, these used to sell for $8 a pop. Too expensive, though.- Yeah, I guess that is. I mean, it's funny to me that they sell them as patties because you can buy the pound of the stuff, and it's-- well, I mean, I guess they do that with ground beef too. Like, it's so difficult to shape ground stuff.[INTERPOSING VOICES]- Nobody wants to do that.- I guess not. You just wash your hands afterwards. It's-- but yes, that is certainly then when they first came out, that is a lower price than we saw the introductory price when Beyond Meat was the new hot thing--- Gosh, that looks good.- --on the market.- Oh, those photos. Oh. Look, I like the plant-based food. Impossible. I like Beyond. To me, it tastes great.- On your breakfast sandwich too?- Yeah, anywhere I can get it. Yeah.]"

The cartel is set to meet on December 4, its last meeting for the year, to decide on production.Brent oil futures jumped nearly 1% to $84.09 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures were flat around $77.27 a barrel by 21:09 ET (02:09 GMT).Oil prices are currently trading below the levels that spurred October’s supply cut by the OPEC, driving up hopes that the cartel will cut production when it meets this Sunday.The OPEC announced a 2 million barrel per day supply cut in October to drive up prices, which had briefly put oil close to $100 a barrel.But concerns over weakening demand, swiftly pulled back prices, driving them to a 11-month low in recent sessions. Rising U.S. interest rates and waning demand in China were the biggest headwinds to oil markets this year, while strength in the dollar also made crude shipments more expensive for major importers.Hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve on Monday drove up the dollar and indicated pressure on the U.S. economy, which could dent its appetite for crude. Fed members James Bullard and John Williams both said on Monday that the central bank will likely begin trimming rates well into 2024, and that more rate hikes were warranted to combat inflation.Anti-government protests in China now raise the prospect of more economic disruption in the world’s largest crude importer. But some analysts argued that the protests could also push the government into relaxing its strict anti-COVID measures, which is the target of the protestors.Story continuesChina is grappling with its worst COVID outbreak ever, which could see the government remain hesitant over relaxing its zero-COVID policy. The recent protests were triggered by the reintroduction of anti-COVID restrictions across several major cities.Related ArticlesOil surges as speculation over OPEC cut outweighs China concernsGold sinks below $1,750 on hawkish Fed comments, copper steadyU.S. seeks to limit flaring and methane leaks from public lands drilling]"

Digital payment transactions have grown quickly in emerging markets in the last two years, and the COVID-19 pandemic helped the transition to digital payments and e-commerce. People leaned more towards e-wallets, online payments, direct bank transfers, and companies partnered with digital money providers to extend their customer base during the peak pandemic years. Africa and Southeast Asia saw the fastest acceleration in digital payments, as these regions have lesser banking access, which leaves higher potential to tap into underserved populations. Another significant development of the pandemic years has been the popularity of “buy now, pay later”, a type of short-term credit used by companies which enables consumers to divide payments into installments.On November 24, Rodney Bain, co-founder and US president of payments fintech Apexx Global, told Financial Times: “The pandemic had a profound effect on digital payments, driven by two key factors. The fundamental inability for consumers to make in-store transactions during lockdowns and general discomfort with exposure to physical environments; and the economical strain felt by consumers during the pandemic.” Some of the best digital payments stocks to invest in include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Our Methodology We selected the following digital money stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and future growth prospects.

Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is a Hong Kong-based company that operates an online brokerage and wealth management platform in Hong Kong and internationally. The company offers trading, clearing, settlement services, margin financing, securities lending services, and stock yield enhancement programs. On November 21, the company reported a Q3 GAAP EPADS of $0.68, beating market estimates by $0.07. The revenue of $247.9 million also outperformed Wall Street estimates by $19.75 million. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)’s total number of paying clients increased 23.8% year-over-year to 1,444,955 as of September 30, 2022.Investment advisory DBS Bank initiated coverage of Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) on October 24 with a Buy rating and a $55 price target.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 14 funds reported owning stakes worth $113.3 million in Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 9 funds in the prior quarter worth $153.2 million. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares valued at $49 million. Like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is one of the best  digital money stocks to invest in. Here is what Tao Value has to say about Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“Futu is a new “Opportunistic” position. It is an HK based online brokerage &amp; wealth management platform with deep roots in technology. Futu sits in the confluence of 3 strong favorable forces of Meteorology, Topography &amp; Commander, yet was underpriced at the time of our entry. In terms of Meteorology, there is a huge addressable market of Chinese domestic middle to upper classes’ wealth being deployed to overseas assets allocation in the next decade. Additionally, the incumbents being disrupted are extremely weak in their digital transformation. On Topography, Futu’s user-centric product design built an intuitive front end and great user experience, while the digital native development framework built a solid &amp; reliable back end (including a self-developed order routing &amp; execution system for the HK market). This is a rare combination compared to both offline incumbents (who lack flashy front end &amp; UX) &amp; other new online disrupters (who lack solid infrastructure). On Commander factor, founder CEO Li Hua was a Tencent engineer in its early days with deep knowledge in product design and development. Li is said to be a fanatic product manager, to this day still at the front-line, alpha testing any new features. Based on analyses of these factors, I think Futu could compound its revenue at a very high rate with very high certainty and with strong operating leverage, putting our entry price very attractive compared to earning power in 3-5 years. Yet just as we finished building a small position, the price started to take off and more than tripled in a month. When such price action happens, it is obvious that Mr. Market has turned very euphoric to this name. I decided to trim but kept a reasonable position given its growth certainty.”10. Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) is a Texas-based financial technology and bank holding company that provides financial products to consumers and businesses in the United States. It operates through three segments – Consumer Services, Business to Business Services, and Money Movement Services. It is one of the best digital money stocks to monitor. On November 9, Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 and a revenue of $337.2 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.09 and $7.19 million, respectively. The company sees year-over-year growth in revenue per account and positive trends in its GO2bank product. Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal on November 14 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $21 from $25 following the Q3 earnings.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 22 hedge funds were long Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT), compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP is the largest position holder in the company, with 5.3 million shares worth $100.5 million. Here is what Steel City Capital has to say about Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“The Partnership recently established new positions in Green Dot (GDOT). As for GDOT, the company is a collection of old-school money access/money movement operations as well as new-school “FinTech” offerings. It is perhaps best known as the banking partner behind Wal-Mart’s prepaid MoneyCard debit card. Prepaid debt is among the least sexy financial service offerings in the market and I also suspect there’s a degree of snobbery among the investing class that its primary customers sit on a lower socio-economic rung. I think these factors are contributing to today’s opportunity.One of the emerging trends in the “FinTech” space is integration of banking and payment services by consumer facing companies. The idea is that by integrating these services, companies can collect more data on spending patterns, drive a “stickier” customer relationship/brand loyalty, and ultimately drive more sales. At the same time, such consumer facing companies either can’t, or won’t, build out these platforms on their own. Doing so would require, among other things, 1) a specific degree of technological expertise and 2) ownership and control of a banking institution. The latter of the two factors – owning a banking charter – is a significant deterrent to “going it alone.” Owning a bank requires costly and time consuming compliance (AML/KYC, etc.) and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Over the years, a long list of household names with financial services ambitions (including Wal-Mart) have either tried and failed, or proactively decided against owning and operating a bank. This is where someone like GDOT comes in, supplying the technical know-how and offering use of their banking charter without the headaches of actually becoming a regulated bank. In industry parlance, this has come to be known as “Banking-as-a-Service” or BaaS, for short.GDOT’s relationship with Wal-Mart has shifted more in the direction of BaaS than “just” prepaid debit with WalMart last year converting all of their existing prepaid accounts to demand deposit accounts intended to function similarly to a traditional banking account. MoneyCard now comes complete with an app and various features like overdraft protection, early payday, and cashback on Wal-Mart purchases. Beyond Wal-Mart, GDOT has expanded its BaaS offerings with other large brands. Another interesting use case is its Partnership with Intuit’s QuickBooks. When you open a new QuickBooks business account, you’re given the option to open a QuickBooks branded business checking account at the same time, which is powered on the back-end by GDOT. There’s a lot of white space out there for GDOT to work with additional consumer facing companies to integrate payments and other banking services into their platforms. I’ll acknowledge that GDOT is far from the only “player” in the arena, but the mere fact that they’ve already bagged a number of large name clients on the BaaS side (Intuit/QuickBooks, Apple/Apple Cash, Uber/Uber Checking) at least suggests their capabilities and offerings have passed an intense amount of scrutiny…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) is a California-based company that provides a platform for digital and mobile-first commerce in the United States, Canada, and internationally. The company's platform includes point-of-sale payment solutions for consumers, merchant commerce solutions, and a consumer-focused app. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)’s revenue of $361.62 million grew 34.2% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $1.15 million.On November 10, DA Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler reiterated a Buy rating on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) but lowered the price target on the shares to $32 from $50 after its FQ1 results and updated guidance. The company reported a solid quarter against increasing macro headwinds and while the stock sold off, he is not worried as underlying trends suggest Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) continues to significantly outperform peers, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 26 hedge funds were bullish on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the prior quarter. Colin Moran’s Abdiel Capital Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.16 million shares worth $40.7 million. Here is what Bireme Capital specifically said about Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “We recently covered our short position in Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) after a rapid decline brought the share price to ~$30 – down from our entry point above $100 – in only 7 months. We discussed Affirm in our Q4 letter, saying the following:Affirm is a “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) company founded by former PayPal CTO and cofounder Max Levchin. They provide installment loans to consumers, partnering with retail companies looking to drive higher sales. They have two primary products: a zero-fee installment loan for consumers with the best credit scores, and a more traditional product with 20%+ interest rates for subprime borrowers. Their stated plan is to disrupt the credit industry with more transparent, lower-fee loans. At a roughly $28b market cap at the start of 2022, AFRM stock was priced at more than 20x trailing sales, a steep price for a money-losing lender. While their early lead in online BNPL transactions and partnerships with fast-growing retailers like Peloton has fueled significant historical growth, a wave of competition has arrived… While the stock has already fallen sharply from where we initiated our short position, we think it could fall another ~40% to trade at 8x FY2022 sales.Interestingly, not much has changed about Affirm’s business from when it sported a $28b market cap. Estimates for 2022 sales have been inching up, from $1.25b at the start of the year to $1.35b today. And analysts estimate that the company will lose about $150m of EBITDA this year, slightly better than estimates in January. Rather than a story of deteriorating business fundamentals, this was a story of market participants simply deciding that a fast-growing, money-losing subprime lender – even a disruptive one – with around $1b of revenues should not be worth twenty-eight billion dollars. We think the current valuation is much more reasonable, and we do believe that Affirm will eventually generate profits from its lending platform, so we covered our short position.”8. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) is a Wisconsin-based company that provides payment and financial services technology worldwide. The company operates through Acceptance, Fintech, and Payments segments. It is one of the best digital money stocks to consider buying. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) raised its full-year 2022 outlook and now expects organic revenue growth of 11% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.48 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% from its prior view of $6.45 to $6.55. The consensus adjusted EPS came in at $6.48. On October 28, Citi analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar maintained a Buy recommendation on Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $115 from $122 following the “mixed” third quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) was part of 59 hedge fund portfolios, with collective stakes worth approximately $4 billion. Harris Associates held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 21.3 million shares worth $2 billion. Artisan Partners made the following comment about Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“While our list of potential candidates is filling up, we are being patient. We added two new positions in Q3: Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) and Heineken. Fiserv is a provider of financial technology, core processing and payment processing services to financial institutions and merchants. The company reports three segments: acceptance (merchant acquiring), payments &amp; networks (issuer processing and debit network), and fintech (core bank processing). Fiserv has strong market positions and scale across these businesses, but competitive intensity varies. In the acceptance segment, Fiserv owns Clover, a high-growth point-of-sale (POS) system forsmall and medium businesses, with similar annualized gross payment volume to Block’s Square. However, Fiserv is receiving little credit for Clover. The market is overly concerned about the competitive nature of merchant acquiring and legacy processors losing market share to new entrants. We believe Fiserv’s business is more resilient and will continue to grow in the medium term driven by its scale and Clover. Moreover, fintech and payments are good businesses that are undervalued by the market. Both businesses are in highly consolidated industries where scale advantages are critical, and revenues are sticky due to high switching costs. A high share of recurring revenue and profit, an attractive margin profile and high free cash flow conversion are characteristics that should provide downside protection, in our view. We started our position with shares selling for about 11X normalized operating profit. That is a below-average multiple for an above-average business.”7. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a Florida-based company that provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide. It operates through Merchant Solutions, Banking Solutions, and Capital Market Solutions segments. On October 20, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) declared a $0.47 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 23, to shareholders of record on December 9. On November 25, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev maintained a Buy recommendation on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $90 from $105. The company's Q3 results were disappointing, but management's focus on cost-cutting can help improve sentiment, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 60 hedge funds were bullish on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter. Select Equity Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $443.5 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also sold out of payments and financial software maker Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), choosing to concentrate our digital payments exposure in PayPal (PYPL), which we believe has a more attractive risk/reward at these levels and more internal levers to generate returns. We bought FIS in 2019 for its mix of offense and defense with banking software and services as a stable business and payments that could keep up with fintech. The shares outperformed the benchmark up to the sale, illustrating the resiliency of the core business; however, FIS has underperformed higher-growth payment names.”6. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based company that provides charge and credit payment card products worldwide. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the leading digital money stocks to invest in. On November 21, UBS analyst Erika Najarian initiated coverage of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) with a Neutral rating and a $168 price target as part of a broader research note on U.S. Consumer &amp; Specialty Finance names. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 68 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $24.8 billion in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter worth $25.2 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest position holder in the company, with 151.6 million shares valued at $20.45 billion. In addition to Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best digital money stocks favored by smart investors. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest In10 Growth Stocks with Upside Potential Disclosure: None. 11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

He also reiterated his view that rates need to rise by at least another 1% to between 5% and 5.25%.Separately, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said the central bank will likely begin trimming rates in 2024, as inflation pressures eventually ease. He also said that borrowing costs need to rise further to bring down inflation.Their comments boosted the dollar, with the greenback jumping nearly 0.7% on Monday. This weighed on most metal markets, particularly gold.Spot gold was flat around $1,741.33 an ounce, while gold futures expiring in December traded around $1,740.00 an ounce, remaining in backwardation. Both instruments sank around 0.6% on Monday.While Bullard and Williams’ comments provided some more clarity on U.S. monetary policy, they also dimmed optimism over a slower pace of rate hikes by the Fed in the coming months, given that rates will likely peak at much higher levels.This paints a dour picture for non-yielding assets such as gold, which fell sharply this year as U.S. rates began rising.Gold saw little safe haven demand this week, even as unprecedented civil unrest in China raised concerns over global economic disruptions.Copper, on the other hand, marked a volatile start to the week, sinking as much as 2% before recovering sharply to trade higher.The outlook for the red metal was dulled by the protests in China, which could further hamper the country’s appetite for commodities. Chinese citizens in several major cities took to the streets over the weekend to express their discontent with the country’s draconian zero-COVID policy.Story continuesCopper futures were steady around $3.6018 a pound in early trade on Tuesday.But some analysts opined that the protests in China may eventually push the government into relaxing its zero-COVID policy, which is at the heart of China’s economic slowdown this year. Such a scenario is likely to be positive for commodity markets.On the supply side, reports suggested that workers at Chile’s massive Escondida copper mine will not go on strike, reducing the prospect of tight supply in the coming months.Related ArticlesGold sinks below $1,750 on hawkish Fed comments, copper steadyOil prices slide on concerns over China's demandU.S. seeks to limit flaring and methane leaks from public lands drilling]"

But our transportation system faces challenges in the immediate and long-term future - potholes in the road ahead. These challenges include finding ways to increase safety and control costs, while simultaneously building towards a transportation future that is sustainable, equitable, and aligned with long-term economic growth.Fortunately, at the heart of the automotive industry lies a historied and vibrant culture of innovation. And one particular innovation - cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology - has the potential to move us forward in addressing many of these challenges.In our digital society, devices talk to each other. From the key fob that opens your apartment door to your tablet that accesses the Internet, we live in a connected world. Increasingly, our cars are no exception. C-V2X technology will let our cars talk to each other and the world around them.Designed specifically for transportation, C-V2X supports direct, low-latency communication between vehicles (V2V), roadside infrastructure (V2I), and vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians (V2P) to inform safety-critical and mobility-enhancing applications. When complemented by cellular networks (V2N), C-V2X makes transportation systems and the entire supporting ecosystem safer and more efficient.When vehicles are connected to everything around them, road users and infrastructure can coordinate their actions to make travel safer - reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities. Because crashes and other non-recurring incidents cause approximately half of all traffic congestion, enhancing vehicle safety also enhances the throughput efficiency of our transportation infrastructure, which directly results in lower greenhouse gas emissions.Connected transportation systems support roadside and driver services that mitigate roadway incidents and improve trip planning, transportation mode choice, and traffic efficiency - enhancements that also lower emissions and reduce fuel consumption. Examples of such services include real-time route guidance to bypass congestion, and adjusting vehicle dynamics for lower emissions and fuel use.Story continuesAlthough C-V2X will bring considerable safety, mobility, and environmental benefits to all regions across the globe, let's focus for a moment on the impact C-V2X can have in the United States. In the US, deployment of C-V2X will boost economic activity as stakeholders invest in new infrastructure, increasing demand for technical and professional labor. It will create an estimated 120,000 American jobs in developing new products, applications, services, and smart infrastructure. The effects will be felt by a broad range of players across all economic sectors, geographies, and skill levels, from auto workers to chipset designers.But for Americans to realize the myriad of benefits that C-V2X has to offer, the federal government must demonstrate leadership by working with public and private transportation industry stakeholders to develop and implement a national plan for C-V2X deployment. Automakers, state departments of transportation, metropolitan planning organizations, and local agencies are eager to deploy connected vehicle technology. But progress towards C-V2X in the U.S. has been stalled by regulatory delays. Meanwhile, other countries are pushing forward and increasing investment in this critical technology.The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to modernize our nation's infrastructure, with more than $1 trillion in funding for projects that incorporate new and innovative technologies. Several IIJA funding programs specifically make C-V2X eligible. These funding opportunities are timely, as 10 states and several major cities, including New York City, have filed requests to deploy C-V2X technology with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The IIJA can serve as a catalyst for nationwide deployment of this life-saving technology, but only if the FCC acts expeditiously to allow deployments to move forward.With greater federal government leadership, we can soon be on the road to a future of safer, more economical, and more sustainable transportation - with C-V2X leading the way.Read more about benefits of C-V2X in Qualcomm's recently published C-V2X white paper.Qualcomm, Monday, November 28, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.qualcomm.com/company/sustainabilityEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/728985/C-V2X-A-New-Era-of-Smart-Transportation-in-the-United-States-White-Paper]"

Working within a family of common open architectures ensures products and solutions are drop-in ready with no vendor lock.Expert Perspectives""The integration of 5G and military tactical radios into our Hybrid Base Station enables resilient, link-diverse data routing throughout the battlespace to make future crewed-uncrewed distributed teaming missions possible,"" said John G. Clark, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works®. ""The Lockheed Martin 5G.MIL® HBS was designed using open mission systems standards so that the technology can onramp to multiple and varied platforms quickly in support of our customers' transformation vision.""""Lockheed Martin's latest innovation for HBS (Hybrid Base Station) highlights the type of highly flexible and portable data capabilities made possible by a virtualized and software-programmable architecture powered by Intel FlexRAN reference architecture and Intel Xeon processors,"" said Dan Rodriguez, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's Network and Edge Solutions Group. ""Our continuing collaboration on 5G.MIL showcases new abilities to strengthen DoD critical digital communications across Lockheed Martin's platforms.""Dive Deeper By implementing the HBS within a 3U/VPX rugged form factor, Lockheed Martin demonstrated over-the-air 5G and tactical network connectivity in a laboratory environment that is capable of transitioning to military air vehicles. While most applications of 5G base station technology are data center centric, this demonstration hosted 5G O-RAN technology on ruggedized computers suitable for fighter and other aircraft, paving the way for the team to fly on any number of military platforms during upcoming crewed-uncrewed distributed teaming flight tests.Story continuesThe demonstration also leveraged 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, which are designed to provide the greatest performance per watt. These processors enable a low Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) solution required by platforms operating at the tactical edge, significantly reducing the amount of hardware required to perform the same functionality.What's Next? This 3U/VPX HBS integration success positions the team for crewed-uncrewed flight testing next year as part of Lockheed Martin's Project Carrera. Additionally, Lockheed Martin and Intel continue to explore how to best bridge current applications of 5G commercial stacks with military datalinks to bring the most capable, resilient communications solutions to the Department of Defense. This includes next generation software defined radios capable of commercial 5G, as well as future waveform implementations to meet the objectives of crewed-uncrewed teaming. These advancements pave the way for operators to have greater connectivity, faster and more reliable networks, and enhanced interoperability in support of Joint All Domain Operations.About Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.Please follow @LMNews on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation.Intel, the Intel logo, and other Intel marks are trademarks of Intel Corporation or its subsidiaries. CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lockheed-martin-successfully-hosts-advanced-5gmil-capabilities-on-flight-ready-hardware-301686639.htmlSOURCE Lockheed Martin Aeronautics]"

Dividend payments also hit record levels this year as many companies reinstated or raised their payouts after being suffered by the pandemic of 2020. The net dividend gain for the 12 months ending September 2022 was $71.5 billion, compared with $61.4 billion during the same period last year, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The report also mentioned that cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 grew by 8.5% in Q3 2022 from the prior-year period.Analysts are also recommending income strategies in the current economic landscape. David Kostin, an equity strategist chief at Goldman Sachs, spoke about dividend stocks in the firm’s late October note. He highlighted the significance of dividend companies during times of weak economic growth. He mentioned that companies that returned cash to shareholders significantly outperformed the market during previous inflationary periods. The firm estimates a 6% growth in dividend per share over the next 10 years, compared with a 0.5% per share growth in dividends according to market pricing. Moreover, dividend growth has never been below 2% on a 10-year annualized basis since 1950.According to Morgan Stanley, investors should focus on dividend companies offering consistent growth in their payouts. These reliable securities are safe in times of economic clampdown as they have strong cash flows and solid balance sheets. The report also mentioned that banks, utility, beverages and household products, packaged food, and energy are some of the sectors that currently offer attractive yields and have strong dividend growth track records. Some of the popular dividend stocks that are gaining investors’ attention include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continues10 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds' holdings and picked the top 10 dividend stocks with over 5% yield.10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Share We also took advantage of a pullback in stocks to acquire shares of Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), though as mentioned above, our timing could have been better. Blackstone is the largest alternative asset manager in the world with nearly $1 trillion of assets under management (AUM) and $700 billion of fee-earning capital. More importantly, 40% of Blackstone’s AUM is perpetual in nature and 90% of revenue is tied to capital that is perpetual or long term in nature. We have long admired Blackstone due to its strong brand, premier global franchise, loyal investor base, nearly 40-year superior investment track record, and talented executive team anchored by CEO Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray.The company has been at the forefront of new product innovation, and we believe that Blackstone will continue to be the winner against an appealing industry backdrop with durable growth characteristics, underpinned by: i) a large and growing addressable market in alternative investments of $10 trillion today vs. $250 trillion for stocks and bonds; ii) institutions continuing to allocate increasing amounts of capital to alternatives (due to historical lower volatility and higher returns); and iii) the opportunity in the retail/high net worth channel that is less than 5% penetrated (versus approximately 30% for institutions)…” (Click here to read the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest In10 Growth Stocks with Upside PotentialDisclosure.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has gained 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.5%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.27 indicates a change of +2.3% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $23.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4%. The $95.04 billion and $98.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.4% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.2%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Carvana Co (NYSE:CVNA) was downgraded by Argus to Sell from Hold. The analyst commented, ""As used car prices fall, we believe that Carvana will struggle to make a profit on vehicles previously purchased at high prices. The company is also highly leveraged, with a debt/capital ratio of 95%. CVNA shares are down sharply from their 52-week highs, reflecting both the company's recent results and weak industry trends, as more consumers defer large purchases amid rising interest rates and increased economic uncertainty."" Shares were off 7.2% for the week to $8, ad are down 96.7% for the year.2. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) was downgraded by at least two analysts after disappointing earnings: Medtronic reported a revenue drop and cut its full-year profit guidance to reflect macro pressure and FX headwinds. Citi downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $85 per share (from $108), and Oppenheimer downgraded it to Perform from Outperform with an $85 price target.The Citi analyst said, ""This was one of those quarters when investors (and we) question the ability of Medtronic to deliver MSD revenue growth over time."" Oppenheimer said, “We continue to see solid long-term pipeline opportunities and valuation is supportive, but with visibility on near-term fundamentals still low, we step to the sideline,” Lichtman wrote. Shares were down 0.8% for the week to $79.12.3. Victory Capital Holdings (NASDAQ:VCTR) was downgraded by at Piper Sandler to Underweight from Overweight with a price target of $29 (from $34).The analyst commented, ""We are cautious on the traditional asset management space into year-end and are downgrading VCTR to Underweight given the pressure to revenues from turbulent markets and outflows which are driving continued AUM and revenue declines. We also expect headwinds to fee yields over the NTM from the retail and equity outflows."" Shares were down 9.9% for the week to $28.87.Story continues4. UGI (NYSE:UGI) Corporation was downgraded by BofA Securities to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $41 (from $43).The analyst commented, ""We reduce our FY23 EPS estimate to $2.77, now below Street as propane volumes hold steady to FY22 performance, and volume reductions and divestiture losses as UGI exits European energy marketing pose a ~$0.22 EPS drag in FY23. We also flag 4Q22’s negative operating cash flow of -$132M, unheard-of for UGI having posted OCF-positive fourth-quarters for over two decades."" Shares were up 4.3% for the week to $39.71.5.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision by early January on the companies’ application for accelerated approval.If approved on an accelerated basis, the companies said they would immediately apply for full U.S. regulatory approval which could help secure Medicare coverage.""I think lecanemab has reinvigorated the idea that now you could do a combination of amyloid (and) tau,” Dr. Reisa Sperling, a neurologist and Alzheimer’s researcher at Harvard Medical School, said in an interview.Tau naturally accumulates in a memory center of the brain called the medial temporal lobe as people age. A growing body of research suggests that rising levels of amyloid in Alzheimer’s patients act as an accelerant, causing an explosive spread of tau that forms toxic tangles inside brain cells, eventually killing them.“We’ve been trying to do combination trials for years,” Sperling said. Nearly a decade ago, Alzheimer’s experts met in Washington to discuss testing combined therapies. At the time, “no one would listen,” she said.Story continuesNow, however, Sperling and other researchers in the Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC), a research network backed by the National Institute on Aging, say drugmakers are increasingly interested in participating in a study to test tau drugs alone and in combination with anti-amyloid drugs such as lecanemab.“We've been talking to multiple companies about working with us on our proposed platform, which can evaluate multiple drugs, and everybody's interested,” said Dr. Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, and a leader with Sperling of the ACTC.The scientists said they expect an answer on funding by year-end. NIH said it does not discuss grants under review.More than 6 million Americans have Alzheimer’s, costing the U.S. economy nearly $6 billion a year in direct spending and unpaid caregiving expenses, according to congressional briefing documents. By 2050, Alzheimer’s cases are expected to double to 12.7 million, bringing the total yearly cost to nearly $1 trillion, according to the documents.Last year, the FDA gave Biogen and Eisai’s drug aducanumab conditional approval even though it failed one of its two late-stage trials. The approval was based on the drug’s ability to remove amyloid from the brain.Biogen initially priced the drug at $56,000 a year, but the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it needed more compelling evidence, and that Medicare would only cover the drug for use in clinical trials.Lecanemab’s success rests on years of research into the causes of Alzheimer’s as well as advances in measuring amyloid deposits through brain scans and spinal fluids. Trials of tau drugs will aim to build on that progress, using brain scans, spinal fluids and blood tests to better assess the stage of disease, when to intervene and whether the drug is hitting its target. That would allow companies to test drugs even before symptoms emerge.Nearly a dozen drugmakers, including Roche, Merck &amp; Co, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Eli Lilly and Co, are working on therapies that target tau. At least 16 treatments are being tested in clinical trials, with results expected over the next three years, according to a Reuters review of the clinicaltrials.gov registry.Merck is testing its MK-2214 therapy aimed at clearing tau in patients in very early stages of the disease in several small trials.""The understanding of the disease is getting much, much better,"" said Jason Uslaner, Merck’s head of discovery neuroscience. The drugmaker has been largely absent from the Alzheimer's space after the high-profile failure of its drug verubecestat five years ago.So far, only a few trials combine an amyloid-lowering therapy with a drug that targets tau in a “cocktail” approach, similar to those used against cancers and HIV.Such combinations may improve on the benefit of lowering amyloid alone in people who have symptoms, researchers told Reuters. And when used earlier in the disease, the hope is that they might prevent dementia altogether.“It may be that you need both - the removal of amyloid that's driving that biological cascade - and you need to clean up any tau that's already spreading from one cell to another,” said Dr. Adam Boxer, a tau expert at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center.But several antibody therapies from Lilly, Biogen and AbbVie that were designed to slow the rate of tau accumulations failed outright last year. A drug from Roche, semorinemab, showed limited effectiveness.""It took maybe 20 or 30 years before we found a drug that really targeted the right form of amyloid to make a difference,” Boxer said. “It’s still early days.” (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Suzanne Goldenberg)]"

The shares just secured their sixth-straight all-time high after surging to $108.90 earlier today. Last seen up 1% to trade at $108.56, MRK now boasts a 41.4% year-to-date lead. Bullish traders should keep their foot on the throttle, however, as historical evidence suggests that the equity has a lot left in the tank.Specifically, Merck stock's recent highs come amid historically low implied volatility (IV) for the stock -- a bullish combination in the past. Per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been four similar times during the past three years when the equity was within 2% of a 52-week high while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th annual percentile or lower. This is true of MRK, which sports an SVI of 19% that stands higher than just 7% of readings from the past year.Digging deeper, the security averaged a 17% return after three of those signals. From where it currently sits, a move of similar magnitude would put Merck stock at roughly $110.40.MRK Chart November 282022Analysts are generally positive on the blue-chip name, though there's still a little room for potential upgrades/price-target hikes. Specifically, five of the 16 following MRK rate it a ""hold."" Plus, the consensus 12-month price target of $110.35 represents a slim 1.7% premium to current levels.It's also worth noting the security's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) ranks at 88 out of 100, meaning the equity has exceeded options traders' volatility expectations in the past year.]"

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is Innoviva (INVA). INVA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 8.04, while its industry has an average P/E of 16.39. Over the past 52 weeks, INVA's Forward P/E has been as high as 11.29 and as low as 7.03, with a median of 8.64.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. INVA has a P/S ratio of 2.44. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 4.54.Merck &amp; Co.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $107.5 in the previous session. Merck has gained 40.3% since the start of the year compared to the -17.4% move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 10.9% return for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 27, 2022, Merck reported EPS of $1.85 versus consensus estimate of $1.67.For the current fiscal year, Merck is expected to post earnings of $7.38 per share on $59.16 billion in revenues. This represents a 22.59% change in EPS on a 17.94% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $7.34 per share on $58.3 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -0.5% and -1.45%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMerck may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Merck has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 14.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 14.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.7X versus its peer group's average of 10.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.43. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Merck currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Merck meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Merck shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

145,2ef93879-46d5-3360-88a1-4e3424af3b89,WMB,2022-11-29,Clearfield and Upstart have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clearfield-upstart-highlighted-zacks-bull-133901480.html,1669642741,STORY,"['WMB', 'DCP', 'MPLX']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 28, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Clearfield (CLFD) as the Bull of the Day and Upstart (UPST) asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on DCP Midstream LP (DCP), The Williams Companies Inc (WMB) and MPLX LP (MPLX).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Clearfield is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that manufactures, markets, and sells standard and custom passive connectivity products to the fiber-to-the-premises, enterprises, and original equipment manufacturers markets in the United States and internationally.In a market that has been unkind to most stocks, Clearfield has been a clear outperformer. The stock is up 65% in 2022 and after a recent earnings report has taken out all-time highs.Clearfield is doing something right, but in a market that is so negative, can the stock continue this momentum into 2023?About the Company Clearfield was founded in 1979 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, MN. It employs 250 people and has a market cap of $1.7 Billion.Clearfield provides fiber protection, fiber management and fiber delivery solutions that enable rapid and cost-effective fiber-fed deployment throughout the broadband service provider space. The company has a strong competitive position as 5G and NG-PON2 technologies are rolled out to meet rapidly growing demand.CLFD has a Zacks Style Score of ""B"" in Growth and ""A"" in Momentum. The stock has a Forward PE of 26 and has a Zacks Style Score of ""D"" in Value. Q4 Earnings Beat Clearfield recently reported a 52% EPS beat for Q4. The company saw Q4 revenues more than double year over year and raised its 2023 revenue outlook. FY23 revenues were taken to a range of $380-393M v the $290M expected.This quarter followed up on a monster Q3 and shows that the company's earnings momentum is very strong.Gross profit margin was down year over year, but their quarter over quarter backlog was up 148% y/y to $165M.Story continuesClearfield is looking to build capacity to reduce their backlog, but is concerned that finding labor is an uncertainty.Investors loved the quarter and the stock surged after the earnings report. It took just four trading days to take the stock up over 30 points to all-time highs. Analyst Estimates Because of the big quarter, analysts are taking earnings estimates higher.Over the last 7 days, estimates have spiked across all-time frames. For the current quarter, we have seen a move from $0.85 to $1.02, or 20%. Next year, estimates have gone from $0.85 to $1.09, or 28%.Looking down the road, analysts are very excited for next year. Estimates have gone from $3.60 to $4.95, or 37%, over the last 7 days. Along with estimates, analysts are lifting price targets. Northland Capital lifted its target from $110 to $120 and Needham has gone from $115 to $135.The TechnicalsThe stock is trading at all-time highs, so the question now is how much meat is left on the bone. To find a price target we can use the 161.8% Fibonacci extension, which can be found drawing the November highs to lows. This level is at $155, which is about 20% above current trading levels.For those that want to avoid chasing the momentum, waiting for a pullback could be an option. The 21-day moving average is at $107, the 50-day MA is at $102.50. The 200-day MA is all the way down at $80.50 and not likely to print anytime soon. Bottom Line Clearfield continues to post strong earnings momentum. With that, the stock has shown relative strength in a year that most stocks have been trading lower. Look for CLFD to close out 2022 on a strong note. If the company can continue to outperform on earnings, next year could be a breakout year for the company and the stock.Bear of the Day:Upstart is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an AI lending platform connecting consumers to bank partners.The stock took off last year shortly after their IPO and was one of the hottest names in 2021. After some solid earnings reports, the stock ran from $30 to $400, topping out in October of 2021.Since the tops, earnings have slowed and the stock has collapsed, falling back below the IPO price. While some investors might see the price as a bargain, there is clearly an issue after the company posted its worst quarter since going public.About the Company Upstart is headquartered in San Mateo, CA. The company was founded in 2012 and employs about 1,500 people.Upstart is valued at $1.5 billion and has a Forward PE of 190. The company holds a Zacks Style Score of ""B"" in Growth, but ""D"" in Momentum and ""C"" in Value.Q3 Earnings Since their IPO, Upstart has beaten earnings every quarter. But in early November the company reported their first miss, with a whopping 242% surprise to the downside.Q3 came in at -$0.24 v the $0.07 expected and revenues came in at $157M v the $172M expected. The company guided Q4 adjusted net income at -$40M and revenue is now seen at a range of $125-145M v the $181M expected.Bank partner originated loans were down 48% y/y and conversion on rate requests were 10% v 23% y/y.Higher interest rates were an obvious culprit to the disappointing quarter and analysts do not see this improving.Analyst EstimatesOver the last month, numbers have been taken down across all time frames.For the current quarter, estimates have dropped into the negative, going from $0.09 to -$0.47. For the current year, estimates have fallen from $0.73 to $0.10, a drop of 86%.Analysts don't see things improving anytime soon. Numbers for next year have dropped from $1.42 to $0.49 over the last 30 days. This is a drop of 65% and is a red flag for investors to stay away until there is a turn around.Along with estimates, price targets are headed lower. Goldman Sachs reiterated its Sell and dropped their price target to $11 from $14. Mizuho also reiterated their underperform and dropped their price target to $12 from $17.Technical TakeThe UPST chart is one that will be referenced for years when talking about the 2021 bubble. The stock went from $30 to $400 and is now under $20. It has been a death spiral lower that has given no opportunity to anyone buying a dip.The 200-day moving average is up at $52.20 and way out of reach. The stock has been trading along the 50-day moving average since August, with that area being a selling point.The low is $14.02 and the 61.8% retracement drawn from that low to November highs is $17.50. This spot is holding for now, but if the stock were to break that support area, the lows will likely come and a move under $10 is possible.In SummaryUpstart will have many hurdles with interest rates staying elevated. The stock will likely continue grinding lower or trade sideways until the business can show growth like it did in years past.Additional content:3 Midstream Stocks to Gain in a Volatile Energy MarketBroad inflationary pressures and rising coronavirus infections overseas are making the broader market extremely volatile. Many investors believe that uncertainty will prevail as inflation is not going away anytime soon. Being inherently volatile in nature, the global uncertain business scenario has further induced choppiness in overall energy operations, which is getting reflected in the oil price chart.Companies belonging to the energy sector have been witnessing a choppy business environment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity's price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to bet on midstream stocks like DCP Midstream LP and The Williams Companies Inc, while keeping an eye on MPLX LP.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks belonging to midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, signifying considerably less exposure to both oil and gas price and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space. One stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), one carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and one has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightDCP Midstream LP: DCP Midstream is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model. With 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, the master limited partnership has 2.8 billion cubic feet of daily natural gas pipeline capacity. DCP Midstream, with a Zacks Rank of 1, strongly focuses on strengthening its balance sheet with the foremost priority of reducing debt load.MPLX LP: MPLX has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflows. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, the #2 Ranked MPLX announced that as of third-quarter 2022-end, it had roughly $1 billion available under its unit repurchase authorizations.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. With a Zacks Rank of 3 at present, WMB's assets can meet 30% of the nation's consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

That contrasts with the West, where both certificates are typically granted around the same time.Maiden customer China Eastern Airlines is due to take delivery of its first C919 next month and is expected to operate passenger flights with the type from the first half of next year.Jefferies analysts said last month that they expected COMAC to reach production of around 25 C919s per year by 2030, well behind the current monthly rates of narrowbody production at Airbus and Boeing.Although the C919 is assembled in China, it relies heavily on Western components, including engines and avionics, from companies including GE, Safran and Honeywell International.Tough U.S. export licensing rules have led to delays in sourcing parts and remain a key risk to ramped up production until China replaces foreign engines and components with homegrown technology.

A frequent contributor to business shows on CNBC, Fox News, and Bloomberg, Navellier publishes several newsletters annually which share his investment philosophies and insights as they particularly relate to growth investing. Having received a B.S. in business administration from California State University in 1978, followed by an M.B.A. in finance in 1979, Louis Navellier has decades of experience under his belt, translating what had been purely academic techniques into real market applications.His hedge fund, Navellier &amp; Associates, employs a three-step, bottom-up stock selection process focusing on quantitative analysis, fundamental analysis, and optimization of the securities selected for the portfolio.During a live presentation on the MoneyShow earlier this year, Louis Navellier shared his insights into the market, alongside speculating the what the future may hold. Here is what he said:The US remains an oasis despite the chaos in the world. Americans are naturally optimistic, and our consumer-driven society so far has skirted a recession. However, the Fed is trying to re-establish its credibility by raising key interest rates and threatening to curtail existing economic growth. Engineering a ""soft landing"" has proven to be next to impossible in the past. I expect inflation to ""crack"" in September and decelerate to less than a 4% annual pace. The Fed has traditionally overshot when raising key interest rates, so it is imperative that after pricking the housing bubble that the Fed hits the ""pause button"" to ensure that the US economy does not slip into a recession. I will show investors my best recession-resistant stocks that I expect to prosper regardless of whether the US economy slips into a recession.Story continuesHaving purchased 42 new stocks, and sold out of 55 positions, Louis &amp; Navellier's most notable holdings in Q3 2022 include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”6.

153,8a7cf0f8-7d69-3f2a-ac35-224dd59aafaa,CI,2022-11-29,An Intrinsic Calculation For Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) Suggests It's 46% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-cigna-corporation-nyse-120243060.html,1669723363,STORY,['CI'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.18bUS$10.0bUS$8.60bUS$9.01bUS$9.14bUS$9.28bUS$9.44bUS$9.61bUS$9.79bUS$9.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.44%Est @ 1.6%Est @ 1.71%Est @ 1.79%Est @ 1.85%Est @ 1.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$7.7kUS$8.8kUS$7.1kUS$7.0kUS$6.6kUS$6.3kUS$6.0kUS$5.7kUS$5.5kUS$5.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$218bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$218b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$115bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$181b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$320, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cigna as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.908. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Cigna, we've put together three additional elements you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Cigna , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does CI's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The company has also been gaining from an active inorganic growth strategy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBased in Bloomfield, CT, Cigna provides health services products and solutions to a wide range of clients. CI has a market cap of $99 billion.Can it Retain Momentum?The answer is yes and before we get into the details, let us show you how its estimates for the full-year 2022 stand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $23.13 per share, indicating a 13% rise from $20.47 a year ago. It has witnessed 11 upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against no movement in the opposite direction. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average of 9.8%.The consensus estimate for 2022 revenuesstands at $180.3 billion, signaling a 3.6% year-over-year rise.Now let’s delve into what’s driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.A diversified product portfolio, vast agent network and superior services are supporting Cigna’s membership growth. Its strong Government business, including Medicare Advantage, is a major positive. CI anticipates total medical customer growth of at least 900,000 while the prior view estimated the metric to be at least 800,000. Our estimate suggests total medical customers for 2022 to grow 5.4% year over year.Strategic acquisitions are helping the company to expand its scale and tap into new markets. Buyouts like Express Scripts, OnePath Life Insurance and others are praiseworthy. These moves are helping the company to consistently increase its top line. CI expects adjusted revenues for 2022 at a minimum of $179 billion. The company is on track to achieve 6-8% average annual adjusted revenue growth in the long term.Cigna also expects long-term adjusted earnings per share to witness 10-13% average annual growth. The company does not shy away from divesting less profitable businesses to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CI divested its life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses to insurer Chubb and received net after-tax proceeds of around $5.1 billion. It also divested its non-health insurance unit, Group Life and Disability insurance business to New York Life, America’s largest mutual life insurer.Story continuesWith the growing proportion of older persons in the population, demand for the company’s products is expected to increase. Also, rising employment and economic recovery will benefit the company’s commercial business. We expect total U.S. Commercial customers to rise 7.1% in 2022. This will result in higher premiums. Furthermore, we expect pharmacy revenues to jump 5.2% year over year in 2022.Cigna has a strong shareholder value-boosting program in place. It bought back 22 million shares of common stock worth around $5.8 billion over the first three quarters. This year, it plans to buy back at least $7 billion worth of shares.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that are holding back the stock’s growth. A debt-laden balance sheet and rising operating expenses are concerning. At the third-quarter end, it had long-term debt of $28,090 million and short-term debt of $3,488 million. Total benefits and expenses rose 5% year over year in the first nine months of 2022. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive the company’s long-term growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Elevance Health Inc.

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.45%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.16%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the athletic apparel maker had gained 12.93% over the past month. This has outpaced the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 6.36% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.54% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Nike as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be December 20, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Nike to post earnings of $0.66 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 20.48%.

As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

(NKE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-attracting-investor-140002290.html,1669644002,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +12.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.5% change. The Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, to which Nike belongs, has gained 13.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -20.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 indicates a change of +26.1% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nike.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nike, the consensus sales estimate of $12.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.8%. The $48.97 billion and $52.84 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.8% and +7.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.91%. The EPS surprise was +2.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NVAX have slumped 88.4% so far this year compared with the industry’s 19.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne of the primary reasons for this substantial decline was the delayed launch of the company’s protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, compared with its peers like Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA. These companies’ vaccines dominate the COVID vaccine space. Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine is also its first marketed product.The FDA filing, which was supposed to have been done by management in May 2021, was completed after several delays in January 2022. This delayed filing resulted in a substantial loss of market share for Novavax. Though the vaccine was granted FDA’s authorization for adults in July 2022, most individuals in the country have already been inoculated with an mRNA-based COVID vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.Though the vaccine has also been authorized for use in adolescents and as a third/booster dose in adults, it has been severely lagging behind competition and dominance imposed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines. This was also one of the reasons management slashed the company’s total revenue guidance for 2022 twice, down to $2 billion from the original range of $4-$5 billion.Compared to Novavax’s COVID vaccine, mRNA-based vaccines have high efficacy rates. The COVID-19 vaccines developed by Modernaand Pfizer/BioNTech are presently the only COVID-19 vaccines that have received full approval in the United States. While Moderna’s vaccine is approved for adults, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is approved for use in adults and adolescents. Both these vaccines are also authorized for use in individuals aged six months and above in the United States.Novavax is also lagging in the development of Omicron-specific vaccines. Though a late-stage study evaluating its Omicron BA.1 vaccine candidate met the primary strain-change endpoint, the candidate is yet to be launched in the market. In this regard, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have already secured emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA for the use of their respective Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines as a single booster dose in individuals as young as five years of age.Story continuesEarlier this month, Novavax announced that it sent a written notice to GAVI Alliance on Nov 18 to terminate the advance purchase agreement (APA) entered between the two organizations last year for the supply of 350 million doses of its COVID vaccine. Per Novavax, GAVI has breached the APA since it failed to procure the required vaccine doses from the company for the COVAX facility. Management has also stated that GAVI has no right to recover any advance payment made by it to the company under the APA. Per Novavax, GAVI has paid a total of $700 million as a non-refundable advance payment.Reports suggest that GAVI rejected this claim and stated that Novavax was unable to make delivery of a single dose of the protein-based COVID vaccine to COVAX. The company also stated that it would recover the advanced payments made to Novavax made under the APA. A legal battle is most likely to ensue between Novavax and GAVI as both contradict each other’s claims, which may hurt the stock further if there is any negative development in this regard.Novavax, Inc.

166,5c3fd827-e6cf-30da-8db7-3b075c6ffc4e,PFE,2022-11-29,Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-nyse-pfe-uptrend-140108946.html,1669644068,STORY,['PFE'],"[Most readers would already know that Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) stock increased by 6.4% over the past three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Pfizer's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Pfizer How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pfizer is:32% = US$30b ÷ US$93b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.32 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Pfizer's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Pfizer has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 18% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Pfizer was able to see a decent net income growth of 8.6% over the last five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Pfizer's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 14% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Pfizer fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Pfizer Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 73% (or a retention ratio of 27%) for Pfizer suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Moreover, Pfizer is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 42% over the next three years. However, Pfizer's future ROE is expected to decline to 16% despite the expected decline in its payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be steering the foreseen decline in the company's ROE.SummaryIn total, it does look like Pfizer has some positive aspects to its business. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now. Digital money transactions are rising swiftly in emerging markets as innovations increase. Banks, fintechs, and telecom companies must rapidly create strategies to take up market share. Digital payment transactions have grown quickly in emerging markets in the last two years, and the COVID-19 pandemic helped the transition to digital payments and e-commerce. People leaned more towards e-wallets, online payments, direct bank transfers, and companies partnered with digital money providers to extend their customer base during the peak pandemic years. Africa and Southeast Asia saw the fastest acceleration in digital payments, as these regions have lesser banking access, which leaves higher potential to tap into underserved populations. Another significant development of the pandemic years has been the popularity of “buy now, pay later”, a type of short-term credit used by companies which enables consumers to divide payments into installments.On November 24, Rodney Bain, co-founder and US president of payments fintech Apexx Global, told Financial Times: “The pandemic had a profound effect on digital payments, driven by two key factors. The fundamental inability for consumers to make in-store transactions during lockdowns and general discomfort with exposure to physical environments; and the economical strain felt by consumers during the pandemic.” Some of the best digital payments stocks to invest in include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Our Methodology We selected the following digital money stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and future growth prospects. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. Story continues11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy NowPachai Leknettip/Shutterstock.comBest Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now11. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is a Hong Kong-based company that operates an online brokerage and wealth management platform in Hong Kong and internationally. The company offers trading, clearing, settlement services, margin financing, securities lending services, and stock yield enhancement programs. On November 21, the company reported a Q3 GAAP EPADS of $0.68, beating market estimates by $0.07. The revenue of $247.9 million also outperformed Wall Street estimates by $19.75 million. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)’s total number of paying clients increased 23.8% year-over-year to 1,444,955 as of September 30, 2022.Investment advisory DBS Bank initiated coverage of Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) on October 24 with a Buy rating and a $55 price target.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 14 funds reported owning stakes worth $113.3 million in Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 9 funds in the prior quarter worth $153.2 million. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares valued at $49 million. Like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is one of the best  digital money stocks to invest in. Here is what Tao Value has to say about Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“Futu is a new “Opportunistic” position. It is an HK based online brokerage &amp; wealth management platform with deep roots in technology. Futu sits in the confluence of 3 strong favorable forces of Meteorology, Topography &amp; Commander, yet was underpriced at the time of our entry. In terms of Meteorology, there is a huge addressable market of Chinese domestic middle to upper classes’ wealth being deployed to overseas assets allocation in the next decade. Additionally, the incumbents being disrupted are extremely weak in their digital transformation. On Topography, Futu’s user-centric product design built an intuitive front end and great user experience, while the digital native development framework built a solid &amp; reliable back end (including a self-developed order routing &amp; execution system for the HK market). This is a rare combination compared to both offline incumbents (who lack flashy front end &amp; UX) &amp; other new online disrupters (who lack solid infrastructure). On Commander factor, founder CEO Li Hua was a Tencent engineer in its early days with deep knowledge in product design and development. Li is said to be a fanatic product manager, to this day still at the front-line, alpha testing any new features. Based on analyses of these factors, I think Futu could compound its revenue at a very high rate with very high certainty and with strong operating leverage, putting our entry price very attractive compared to earning power in 3-5 years. Yet just as we finished building a small position, the price started to take off and more than tripled in a month. When such price action happens, it is obvious that Mr. Market has turned very euphoric to this name. I decided to trim but kept a reasonable position given its growth certainty.”10. Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) is a Texas-based financial technology and bank holding company that provides financial products to consumers and businesses in the United States. It operates through three segments – Consumer Services, Business to Business Services, and Money Movement Services. It is one of the best digital money stocks to monitor. On November 9, Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 and a revenue of $337.2 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.09 and $7.19 million, respectively. The company sees year-over-year growth in revenue per account and positive trends in its GO2bank product. Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal on November 14 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $21 from $25 following the Q3 earnings.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 22 hedge funds were long Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT), compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP is the largest position holder in the company, with 5.3 million shares worth $100.5 million. Here is what Steel City Capital has to say about Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“The Partnership recently established new positions in Green Dot (GDOT). As for GDOT, the company is a collection of old-school money access/money movement operations as well as new-school “FinTech” offerings. It is perhaps best known as the banking partner behind Wal-Mart’s prepaid MoneyCard debit card. Prepaid debt is among the least sexy financial service offerings in the market and I also suspect there’s a degree of snobbery among the investing class that its primary customers sit on a lower socio-economic rung. I think these factors are contributing to today’s opportunity.One of the emerging trends in the “FinTech” space is integration of banking and payment services by consumer facing companies. The idea is that by integrating these services, companies can collect more data on spending patterns, drive a “stickier” customer relationship/brand loyalty, and ultimately drive more sales. At the same time, such consumer facing companies either can’t, or won’t, build out these platforms on their own. Doing so would require, among other things, 1) a specific degree of technological expertise and 2) ownership and control of a banking institution. The latter of the two factors – owning a banking charter – is a significant deterrent to “going it alone.” Owning a bank requires costly and time consuming compliance (AML/KYC, etc.) and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Over the years, a long list of household names with financial services ambitions (including Wal-Mart) have either tried and failed, or proactively decided against owning and operating a bank. This is where someone like GDOT comes in, supplying the technical know-how and offering use of their banking charter without the headaches of actually becoming a regulated bank. In industry parlance, this has come to be known as “Banking-as-a-Service” or BaaS, for short.GDOT’s relationship with Wal-Mart has shifted more in the direction of BaaS than “just” prepaid debit with WalMart last year converting all of their existing prepaid accounts to demand deposit accounts intended to function similarly to a traditional banking account. MoneyCard now comes complete with an app and various features like overdraft protection, early payday, and cashback on Wal-Mart purchases. Beyond Wal-Mart, GDOT has expanded its BaaS offerings with other large brands. Another interesting use case is its Partnership with Intuit’s QuickBooks. When you open a new QuickBooks business account, you’re given the option to open a QuickBooks branded business checking account at the same time, which is powered on the back-end by GDOT. There’s a lot of white space out there for GDOT to work with additional consumer facing companies to integrate payments and other banking services into their platforms. I’ll acknowledge that GDOT is far from the only “player” in the arena, but the mere fact that they’ve already bagged a number of large name clients on the BaaS side (Intuit/QuickBooks, Apple/Apple Cash, Uber/Uber Checking) at least suggests their capabilities and offerings have passed an intense amount of scrutiny…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) is a California-based company that provides a platform for digital and mobile-first commerce in the United States, Canada, and internationally. The company's platform includes point-of-sale payment solutions for consumers, merchant commerce solutions, and a consumer-focused app. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)’s revenue of $361.62 million grew 34.2% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $1.15 million.On November 10, DA Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler reiterated a Buy rating on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) but lowered the price target on the shares to $32 from $50 after its FQ1 results and updated guidance. The company reported a solid quarter against increasing macro headwinds and while the stock sold off, he is not worried as underlying trends suggest Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) continues to significantly outperform peers, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 26 hedge funds were bullish on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the prior quarter. Colin Moran’s Abdiel Capital Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.16 million shares worth $40.7 million. Here is what Bireme Capital specifically said about Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “We recently covered our short position in Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) after a rapid decline brought the share price to ~$30 – down from our entry point above $100 – in only 7 months. We discussed Affirm in our Q4 letter, saying the following:Affirm is a “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) company founded by former PayPal CTO and cofounder Max Levchin. They provide installment loans to consumers, partnering with retail companies looking to drive higher sales. They have two primary products: a zero-fee installment loan for consumers with the best credit scores, and a more traditional product with 20%+ interest rates for subprime borrowers. Their stated plan is to disrupt the credit industry with more transparent, lower-fee loans. At a roughly $28b market cap at the start of 2022, AFRM stock was priced at more than 20x trailing sales, a steep price for a money-losing lender. While their early lead in online BNPL transactions and partnerships with fast-growing retailers like Peloton has fueled significant historical growth, a wave of competition has arrived… While the stock has already fallen sharply from where we initiated our short position, we think it could fall another ~40% to trade at 8x FY2022 sales.Interestingly, not much has changed about Affirm’s business from when it sported a $28b market cap. Estimates for 2022 sales have been inching up, from $1.25b at the start of the year to $1.35b today. And analysts estimate that the company will lose about $150m of EBITDA this year, slightly better than estimates in January. Rather than a story of deteriorating business fundamentals, this was a story of market participants simply deciding that a fast-growing, money-losing subprime lender – even a disruptive one – with around $1b of revenues should not be worth twenty-eight billion dollars. We think the current valuation is much more reasonable, and we do believe that Affirm will eventually generate profits from its lending platform, so we covered our short position.”8. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) is a Wisconsin-based company that provides payment and financial services technology worldwide. The company operates through Acceptance, Fintech, and Payments segments. It is one of the best digital money stocks to consider buying. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) raised its full-year 2022 outlook and now expects organic revenue growth of 11% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.48 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% from its prior view of $6.45 to $6.55. The consensus adjusted EPS came in at $6.48. On October 28, Citi analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar maintained a Buy recommendation on Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $115 from $122 following the “mixed” third quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) was part of 59 hedge fund portfolios, with collective stakes worth approximately $4 billion. Harris Associates held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 21.3 million shares worth $2 billion. Artisan Partners made the following comment about Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“While our list of potential candidates is filling up, we are being patient. We added two new positions in Q3: Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) and Heineken. Fiserv is a provider of financial technology, core processing and payment processing services to financial institutions and merchants. The company reports three segments: acceptance (merchant acquiring), payments &amp; networks (issuer processing and debit network), and fintech (core bank processing). Fiserv has strong market positions and scale across these businesses, but competitive intensity varies. In the acceptance segment, Fiserv owns Clover, a high-growth point-of-sale (POS) system forsmall and medium businesses, with similar annualized gross payment volume to Block’s Square. However, Fiserv is receiving little credit for Clover. The market is overly concerned about the competitive nature of merchant acquiring and legacy processors losing market share to new entrants. We believe Fiserv’s business is more resilient and will continue to grow in the medium term driven by its scale and Clover. Moreover, fintech and payments are good businesses that are undervalued by the market. Both businesses are in highly consolidated industries where scale advantages are critical, and revenues are sticky due to high switching costs. A high share of recurring revenue and profit, an attractive margin profile and high free cash flow conversion are characteristics that should provide downside protection, in our view. We started our position with shares selling for about 11X normalized operating profit. That is a below-average multiple for an above-average business.”7. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a Florida-based company that provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide. It operates through Merchant Solutions, Banking Solutions, and Capital Market Solutions segments. On October 20, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) declared a $0.47 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 23, to shareholders of record on December 9. On November 25, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev maintained a Buy recommendation on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $90 from $105. The company's Q3 results were disappointing, but management's focus on cost-cutting can help improve sentiment, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 60 hedge funds were bullish on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter. Select Equity Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $443.5 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also sold out of payments and financial software maker Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), choosing to concentrate our digital payments exposure in PayPal (PYPL), which we believe has a more attractive risk/reward at these levels and more internal levers to generate returns. We bought FIS in 2019 for its mix of offense and defense with banking software and services as a stable business and payments that could keep up with fintech. The shares outperformed the benchmark up to the sale, illustrating the resiliency of the core business; however, FIS has underperformed higher-growth payment names.”6.

But business leaders are quickly learning that finding capable workers to fill this growing number of roles will require a more inclusive strategy for hiring and reskilling talent.""We know many talented individuals have the knowledge, skills, and abilities companies are looking for, but the system that we have doesn't work well for applicants or current employees,"" says Lydia Logan, vice president for Global Education and Workforce Development in the Corporate Social Responsibility department at IBM. ""Companies need to look beyond the old paradigm to create opportunities.""IBM is investing in the future of work with a holistic approach that offers access to education and training while creating a more diverse pipeline of applicants to fill the skills gap. In October 2021, IBM announced partnerships with more than 170 academic and industry organizations across the U.S., Japan, India, and elsewhere to help reach its goal of providing technical skills to 30 million people of all ages by 2030. In 2021 alone, IBM reached 3.5 million people globally.""Through our partners, we can reach those who've been traditionally underrepresented in technology: women, veterans, minorities, neurodivergent people, and refugees,"" Logan explains. ""We can't have a one-size-fits-all approach.""These partnerships are designed to help democratize opportunity and give new generations of workers the tools they need to build a better future. They include everything from technical education for teens at public schools and universities to on-site IBM internships and apprenticeships. In September 2022, IBM announced it was expanding its collaboration with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to help them establish cybersecurity leadership centers to increase the number of underrepresented students in the growing field of cybersecurity.Story continuesIBM's education program, called IBM SkillsBuild, is an essential component in reaching the company's skills goal, and available for free to anyone with an internet connection. To ensure learners can understand course materials and professional competency, content is offered in local languages. The online portion of the program offers more than 1,000 courses in 19 languages on cybersecurity, data analysis, cloud computing, and many other technical disciplines.Bria Whitehead is one student who was able to access IBM SkillsBuild while attending Baton Rouge Community College. Through the program, she acquired skills in cybersecurity, professional skills, and agile learning, which she used to land a spot as an IBM apprentice in 2022, giving her access to IBM classes and on-the-job training.""IBM SkillsBuild was extremely valuable in giving me a foundation in the many fields of computer science and gaining fundamental knowledge,"" Whitehead says. ""I can't wait to see what the future has in store for me.""Through its skills programs and partnerships, IBM plans to reach millions like Whitehead.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Gas Stocks To Buy Now. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the shortage of natural gas, further hiking up prices for consumers and businesses alike. This resulted in the use of alternative fuels and demand destruction. It also creates longer-term unpredictably in the natural gas market, especially in emerging nations where it used to play a primary role in energy transitions. According to the International Energy Agency, the Asia Pacific region and the industrial sector are the core drivers of growth in the natural gas market, accounting for 50% and 60% of the growth to 2025, respectively. However, the Asia Pacific region will be subject to high risk from rising prices and slow economic growth.As per IEA data, gas production in North America rose by 2.1% in 2021 although there was limited capital expenditure in the US upstream sector, driven by higher domestic and export demand. Per IEA’s estimates, North America holds a leading position in the intermediate-term in the global growth of natural gas supply, with nearly 85 bcm added between 2021 and 2025. The region represents nearly 40% of the net increase in production capacity and over half of the worldwide net production growth during 2021 and 2025. Some of the best gas stocks to invest in include ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC). Our Methodology We selected the following gas stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and solidity of dividend profiles.

We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”7. Suncor Energy Inc.

(NYSE:SU) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “Also within the structural bucket, we added to our commodity exposure with the purchase of Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU). Suncor, a past holding, is a Canadian integrated oil company where we capitalized on attractive valuation due to a COVID-19-induced slowdown. We expect recovery in oil demand and strong pricing will result in faster than expected free cash flow growth and financial deleveraging.The structural bucket has the shortest investment horizon across the spectrum of growth companies we target in the Strategy. We closely monitor the macro impacts and turnaround progress of these companies and will be disciplined sellers when the thesis for a holding plays out.”6.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Marathon Petroleum MPC, Phillips 66 PSX, Murphy USA MUSA and PBF Energy PBF.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Time to Get Bullish on These 4 Oil Refining and Marketing StocksThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry continues to benefit from strength in fundamentals, strong margins and robust fuel demand. As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, the downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, reefing and marketing firms likeMarathon Petroleum, Phillips 66,Murphy USA and PBF Energy have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products.Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureStrong Refined Products Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 4% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.Story continuesAs economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid the post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2022. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Attractive Margins: The industry's improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs earlier this year.While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high. Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Higher Costs &amp; Inflationary Pressures: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #25, which places it in the top 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. While the industry's earnings estimates for 2022 have increased 159.7% in the past year, the same for 2023 have risen 143.2% over the same timeframe.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 45% over this period compared with the broader sector's increase of 31.4%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 15.8%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.35X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 12.22X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.39X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.67X.4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMarathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States.

The proximity of Murphy USA's fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract.

MUSA, which surpassed third-quarter bottom-line estimates on higher retail gasoline price and margin, carries a Zacks Rank of 2.  Shares of MUSA are up 61.5% in a year.PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, the firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products. PBF's daily processing capacity of 1,000,000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers.The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Parsippany, NJ-based firm indicates 1,048.8% year-over-year earnings per share growth.

As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, the downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, reefing and marketing firms like Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66, Murphy USA and PBF Energy have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products.Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureSrong Refined Products Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 4% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.Story continuesAs economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid the post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2022. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Attractive Margins: The industry's improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs earlier this year. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high.Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Higher Costs &amp; Inflationary Pressures: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #25, which places it in the top 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. While the industry's earnings estimates for 2022 have increased 159.7% in the past year, the same for 2023 have risen 143.2% over the same timeframe.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 45% over this period compared with the broader sector's increase of 31.4%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 15.8%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.35X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 12.22X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.39X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.67X.4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMarathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States.

The proximity of Murphy USA's fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract.

The redesign is rumored to bring a number of changes to the electric sedan. Yahoo Finance senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian has more, Pras.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, Jared, this is a kind of a much needed update for the Tesla Model 3, which has surprisingly been out since 2017 without an area and update. We've probably seen a couple of things under the skin but nothing major. What Reuters is reporting is that Tesla is going to probably update the exterior styling, potentially the powertrain and battery and likely that touchscreen display that's very popular with customers. And it sort of sets the car apart with the kind of minimalist and digital sort of cockpit there.One of the things that Tesla will do is reduce costs of building the car by reducing complexity and also using larger cast moldings that we've seen them use in the Model Y, for instance, to kind of reduce number of parts. So you know, Reuters also says that this car might come out in 2023 of Q3, pricing that first in China and then eventually potentially at Fremont here in the United States.DAVID HOLLERITH: Interesting. And Pras, Chevy unveiled another EV. What can you tell us about it?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, this one is going to be in China, Dave. It's the Chevy FNR-XE. It's funny because GM does not have an EV sedan in the States, or one coming as far as we know. But they're going to do it in China because in China, apparently the sedan sort of body type is still very popular there amongst the people there.It's very sharp-looking car. You can see there both literally and sort of figuratively, right, so really kind of sort of the new design language of Chevy EVs potentially here, looking at this with the FNR-XE. No specs yet, but reports in China suggest it'll come out probably next year. And this is big because 2023 is a big year for GM with regard to this EV onslaught with stuff like the Equinox, the Chevy Silverado EV, and also the Blazer as well.JARED BLIKRE: All right, got to leave it there. Pras Subramanian, thanks as always for that report.]"

The holiday weekend just ended was the first in three years not overshadowed by COVID-19 and associated public health measures.Even so, the number was still more than 11% below the comparable figure three years ago, at the last pre-COVID Thanksgiving weekend, when 2.88 million passengers were screened.By 09:45 ET (14:45 GMT), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock was down 1.8%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock were both down 1.6%. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was down 1.1%.While the numbers confirmed the gradual recovery of domestic air travel, their inability to break 2019's record is testimony to the pressure on consumers' wallets in a year when airlines have put their prices up ferociously to exploit pent-up demand. Fares are up around 30% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data.Long-haul airlines also had to deal with a headwind from a different direction on Monday. Having been supported in the last couple of weeks by hopes that the reopening of China's air corridors would boost business, the sector was among the most directly exposed to fears of political instability and further economic damage arising from the authorities' reversal of course in recent days, doubling down on the Zero COVID strategy that has been in place for nearly three years.Related ArticlesAirline stocks struggle despite strong holiday travel numbersPoland's CD Projekt third-quarter profit soars thanks to Cyberpunk boostIKEA store owner eyes more price cuts as some input costs ease]"

It follows a person through life. Without it, routine tasks can become major or even insurmountable. For many people in the transgender community, the simple act of producing identification - that often doesn't look like them, doesn't identify them as the gender they identify with and uses a birth name that feels foreign to them - can all bring shame.PNC Financial Services Group, Monday, November 28, 2022, Press release pictureHaving a legal name and identification that matches their identity can help humanize the experience of a transgender person and allow them to confidently present an ID.""People are people, and they deserve to be respected. They deserve to live their lives authentically,"" says Sonia Chung, a member of PNC's corporate legal team and pro bono committee.Chung volunteers with the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund's (TLDEF) Name Change Project,1 which matches transgender applicants with legal representation to navigate the process of changing their names.In partnership with Pittsburgh-based law firm Reed Smith, members of PNC's corporate legal team offer their legal expertise to participants. Through the program, they've donated many hours to help dozens of transgender people work through the name change process - at no cost to participants.A Daunting Process Without Support""While you don't need a lawyer to help get your documents changed, it is daunting to do this without support,"" Chung says. ""The whole process, from beginning to end, is several months of work and interaction.""That work includes fingerprinting and background checks for any issues such as outstanding debts or criminal convictions, then filing the paperwork with the court system. Trying to go through it alone without an advocate can be overwhelming and expensive. Transgender people often quit from frustration when they are faced with doing it on their own.""It probably takes a month or two with the court, then there is a court hearing where the name is finally changed. Once the client has their paperwork and it matches who they are, hopefully they can move forward,"" says Chung.Story continuesShe estimated that paying for such assistance might cost several thousand dollars.""The clients I've typically seen through the program don't always have resources, and it would be very difficult to hire a private attorney,"" Chung adds.She recalled two clients who were gainfully employed but qualified for governmental assistance. Without this kind of community effort, they would not have been able to change their documents.Beyond the cost savings, with an attorney's help, the court process becomes more accessible. The transgender person has an advocate, calling them by their chosen name, using the pronouns they identify with and showing them respect.The Name Change Project has helped facilitate over 3,000 name changes since it began in 2007 - 384 completed in 2021. The program currently offers support to people living in all five boroughs of New York and several counties in New Jersey with plans to open additional sites in Chicago, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Detroit.Volunteering The TimePNC Managing Senior Counsel Katy Leonard also volunteers with the pro bono clinics and says the work provides great education and insight into the issues, risks and emotional strain that disadvantaged clients face.While you don't need a lawyer to help get your documents changed, it is daunting to do this without support. The whole process, from beginning to end is several months of work and interaction.- Sonia Chung, member of PNC corporate legal team and pro bono committee""Because I'm not a member of the transgender community, I never really thought about the barriers to them feeling empowered to do things on a day-to-day basis. I see how the rest of us may take that for granted,"" Leonard says. ""Life can be really difficult for transgender individuals with concerns about privacy and safety. So, we counsel them on the process for ensuring their name and address are not on public record.""Blair Miicke, another managing counsel at PNC, also volunteers with the Name Change Project. He sees his participation as alignment with PNC's efforts toward Corporate Responsibility and diversity and inclusion. He encourages prospective volunteers to be involved with the entire process, because it can offer them greater understanding of the client and their story.""Volunteers can't pry into the lives of clients,"" he says, ""but if you listen, you learn what they have had to do to get where they are and to be comfortable with themselves. And that's all pretty amazing.""Reflecting PNC's Commitment to LGBTQ+ EqualityParticipating in the Name Change Project aligns with PNC's ongoing support of organizations that promote diversity and inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community. For example, PNC supports the Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) mission, and joined its Business Coalition for Equality Act. This coalition consists of a group of leading U.S. employers that supports the Equality Act, federal legislation that would provide the same basic protections to members of the LGBTQ+ community as are provided to other protected groups under federal law.This year marks the 10th consecutive year PNC has been recognized as one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality by HRC.These commitments reflect PNC's investment in actively supporting an inclusive culture beyond the walls of the bank - one in which people within the communities the bank serves can feel seen and valued and where their dignity is upheld.""Having a name that both affirms and aligns with who you are and how you wish to be identified can be a transformative experience. It not only empowers the person, but it also improves their access to the same resources others enjoy and supports true inclusion,"" says Gina Coleman, PNC chief diversity officer. ""From that perspective, the Name Change Project's lasting emotional and practical impact can't be measured.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/728978/PNC-Employees-Use-Expertise-to-Assist-Transgender-Community]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the European mall industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Malls in Europe.Market OutlookThe European retail industry is valued at $3.6 trillion as of 2021 according to Statista. There are roughly 10,000 malls in Europe as of 2021, with the United Kingdom taking the biggest share with over 1,500 malls, per their report. The European mall industry’s economic outlook is not very different from those of other regions when it comes to the mall's traditional purpose. Malls in general are declining in popularity, owing to factors like E-Commerce. The online sales already make up 15% of total shopping in most of Europe. The average retail growth is around 4% while online sales grow by an average of a far higher 20%. In fact, the pandemic lockdowns accelerated the E-Commerce growth to 43% in 2020, adding massive amount of value to stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).Moreover, the persistent inflation around the world and the central banks' rate hikes in response have put the mall industry on a slippery slope, as consumers cut back on spending. This has led European REITs to start adapting to a changing shopping landscape. An Adapting IndustryOne of the ways the industry is adapting is extended diversification, with European malls adding more and more experience and service-based incentives, like museums, art galleries, government offices and theme parks etc.  Florencio Beccar, the fund manager of CBRE Global Investors' European Shopping Center Fund, was quoted by NBC News at the purchase of a German mall that came with a medical facility. He said that purchasing malls with services like medical facilities and others is a major advantage to offset decline in physical retail.In addition to that, many REITs are moving towards logistics, which is another way the European mall industry is trying to adapt and survive. According to CBRE research, every $1 billion addition in online sales requires an additional space of 1.3 million square feet in warehouses, raising the demand for fulfillment centers. Story continuesInsofar as Europe is concerned, a Prologis report showed that every additional 1 billion euros in online sales resulted in an average increase in warehouse demand of almost 72,000 square meters in Britain, Germany, and France, during the studied period of 2007-2012. Logistics also has a cost advantage. Retail space costs around $20 per square foot while the same for logistics costs only $6.5. Its yield is also two percentage points higher on average than retail. This has resulted in malls across the world in general and malls in Europe in particular, attempting to transition and rezone the spare retail spaces in their buildings for the logistics business.Simon Hope, the global head of capital markets for the UK-based property consultant Savills, confirmed the trend with NBC News, saying, “logistics is the new retail.”Key PlayersThere are thousands of malls in Europe but some of the most prominent names in the industry are Mega Belaya Dacha in Russia, Westfield Centro in Germany, Bluewater in the UK and Istanbul Cevahir in Turkey. As far as mall-owning REITs are concerned, Klépierre SA (OTCMKTS:KLPEF) is the biggest mall owner in Europe. It owns 155 malls across 16 European countries.Now that we know the state of the mall industry in Europe, let’s move on to the 11 biggest malls in Europe. 11 Biggest Malls in EuropePixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor our list of the 11 biggest malls in Europe, we’d be ranking them based on their total area.

In fact, Cyber Monday has grabbed maximum consumer attention in the recent past as ""the preferred day for deals.""In fact, Cyber Week (Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday) as a whole continues to grow internationally, with more non-Americans participating in the shopping spree. Nearly 8 million more people than last year are expected to shop during the Thanksgiving Weekend this year, per NRF.Consumers hit a new record for Thanksgiving Day spending at $5.29 billion, up 2.9% year over year, per Adobe Analytics data, with mobile shopping driving 55% of online sales. Cyber Monday will remain the year's biggest online shopping day at $11.2 billion, up 5.1% year over year. Black Friday has probably fetched $9 billion by the day's end, up just 1% year over year. Sales growth has declined over the years as retailers have been spreading out the deals and offering them almost throughout the holiday season.Against this backdrop, below, we highlight a few ETFs that are great bets in the current scenario.SPDR S&amp;P Telecom ETF XTLSalesforce projected that global online sales grew 1% on Thanksgiving day to $31 billion, while in the U.S. sales were up 9% to $7.5 billion, quoted on techcrunch.com. Salesforce also said that 78% of sales traffic originated from mobile devices. Average order values were $105 globally and $120 for U.S. sales. Meanwhile, Adobe has predicted that Cyber Week will generate $34.8 billion in online spending this year, up 2.8% year over year. All these indicate the necessity and demand for telecommunication. XTL was up 3.3% last week and has gained 6.2% past month.ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF IPAYRetailers, of late, are offering customers flexibility in financing and shopping. Buy-Now-Pay-Later or Buy Online, Pick-Up in Store (BOPIS) are some of the offers that are in vogue currently. Plus, mobile shopping definitely needs mobile payments.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) Investors Paying Above The Intrinsic Value?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-130025976.html,1669726825.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[How far off is Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical Is Intuitive Surgical Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.13bUS$2.46bUS$2.71bUS$3.10bUS$3.39bUS$3.62bUS$3.82bUS$3.99bUS$4.14bUS$4.27bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.12%Est @ 6.98%Est @ 5.48%Est @ 4.43%Est @ 3.69%Est @ 3.18% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$95bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$95b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$50bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$73b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$263, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.898. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

Despite this tailwind, the industry is being plagued by escalating fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions.Companies like Union Pacific Corporation UNP, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited CP, CSX Corporation CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC are expected to thrive on upbeat freight demand.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry consists of railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services. While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides owning locomotives, some of these companies have equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Railroad IndustryHealthy Freight Demand: Freight demand continues to be strong in 2022 as pandemic fears fade, despite softening from the 2021 levels due to a shift in consumer spending from goods to services. The Cass Freight Index rose 2.9% on a year-over-year basis in October. With steady freight demand, railroads are benefiting from higher volumes and pricing gains. The upbeat freight environment is expected to continue in the near term.Dividend Hikes Signal Financial Strength: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies are reactivating their shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. Earlier in 2022, both UNP &amp; CSX upped its dividend 10% and 7.5% to $1.30 per share and 10 cents per share, respectively.Story continuesSupply-Chain Disruptions a Woe: Persistent supply-chain disruptions, including labor and equipment shortages, are hurting railroad volumes in some segments, especially the carload and intermodal unit. Per The Association of American Railroads’ latest rail traffic data, the total U.S. carload and intermodal units declined 0.5% year over year in October 2022. Supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist for a while now, thus denting carload and intermodal volumes.High Fuel Costs Hurt Bottom Line: Operating expenses are on the rise, mainly due to increased fuel costs. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. High oil price (up 5.7% in the first nine months of 2022) is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains elevated.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93. This rank places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, implies encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Union Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States.With economic activities gaining pace, freight revenues, accounting for the bulk of UNP's top line, are improving. In the first nine months of 2022, freight revenues improved 16% year over year. Segmentwise, freight revenues in the first nine months of 2022 increased 16%, 14% and 19% in the bulk, industrial and premium units, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNP’s 2022 earnings is pegged at 15.8% growth from the 2021 reported number.Price and Consensus: UNPPrice and Consensus: UNPCanadian Pacific: Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Canadian Pacific operates a transcontinental railway network in Canada and the United States.With the gradual recovery in freight-market conditions, freight revenues, contributing considerably to the top line, increased 4% in 2021. In third-quarter 2022, freight revenues increased 19% despite headwinds like supply-chain woes remaining.The increase was owing to higher freight revenues at key sub-groups like intermodal where freight revenues surged 44%. Revenues at the Fertilizers and sulphur sub-segment were up 11% year over year. In the September quarter, total freight revenues per revenue ton-miles (RTMs) rose 11% year over year. Total freight revenues per carload rose 7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CP’s 2022 revenues is pegged at 1.8% growth from the 2021 actuals.Price and Consensus: CPPrice and Consensus: CP       CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, and transport of intermodal containers and trailers besides rail-to-truck transfers.CSX’s top line is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, solid domestic intermodal shipments, volume growth in other segments and pricing gains. Evidently, coal revenues increased 36% in the first nine months of 2022, driven by strength in export coal. Intermodal revenues increased 19% in the first nine months of 2022, led by strong demand, mainly on the domestic front. Demand is likely to remain strong going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSX’s 2022 revenues stands at 22.4% growth from the year-ago reported figure.Price and Consensus: CSXPrice and Consensus: CSXNorfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern is a major freight railroad company, primarily engaged in transporting raw material, intermediate products and finished goods.A strong demand scenario prompted management to increase its current-year revenue growth outlook. Total revenues are now expected to increase above 13% in 2022 from the 2021 levels (earlier outlook: growth in excess of 12%). The intermodal and merchandise segments are expected to be the main drivers. Near-term opportunities are present in the coal segment too. Driven by revenue growth, reported the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is expected to be roughly 62% in 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NSC’s 2022 earnings stands at 13.6% growth from the year-ago reading.Price and Consensus: NSCPrice and Consensus: NSCWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let’s take a look at a pair of highly-ranked Zacks stocks that may continue to excel as we move closer to the Christmas holiday and perhaps a Santa Clause rally.Ross Stores ROST Off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories Ross Stores has been on quite a run of late after beating Q3 expectations. Higher highs could be around the corner for ROST with the stock up roughly 18% following the positive Q3 results.ROST beat Q3 expectations by 23% with EPS of $1.00 per share. This marked an -8% decline YoY but was nevertheless impressive considering economic challenges. Sales were virtually flat from a year ago but beat top line estimates by 5% at $4.56 billion.Despite inflationary headwinds expected to pressure the company’s low-to-moderate income customers, CEO Barbara Rentler said Ross Stores faces its easiest sales and earnings comparisons in Q4. This led to the company raising its guidance given the third quarter sales momentum and improved holiday assortments.Year over year, ROST earnings are expected to drop -12% in its fiscal 2023 at $4.30 per share but this is up from $3.99 a share 90 days ago. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to jump 14% to $4.92 per share. FY24 earnings estimates have also trended higher from $4.60 last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are projected to dip -2% in FY23 to $18.54 billion. Fiscal 2024 sales are expected to stabilize and rise 6% to $19.67 billion. FY24 sales would represent 31% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $14.98 billion.Year to date, ROST is up +2% to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -17% and slightly underperform its peer group’s +5% that includes Burlington Stores BURL and others. Over the last decade, ROST’s total return is +351% to beat the benchmark and its peer group’s +220%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $116 per share ROST has a forward P/E of 26.9X, which is on par with the industry average. ROST trades at a significant discount to its decade high of 84.3X and closer to the median of 21.1X.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChico’s FAS CHS Another retail company that investors want to start paying attention to is Chico’s FAS Inc. The women’s fashion retailer is also receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.CHS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an overall “A” VGM score. Year over year, CHS fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to climb 127% to $0.91 per share. FY24 earnings are set to rise another 10%. Earnings estimates for FY23 and FY24 are largely up over the last 90 days.Top line growth is also expected, with sales set to jump 19% in FY23 and another 5% in FY24 to $2.27 billion.Last week, Chico’s Q3 earnings climbed 33% YoY to beat expectations by 54% with EPS of $0.20 per share. The company also beat top line expectations by 2% with Q3 sales at $518.33 million. CHS grew YoY net sales by 14% on top of 29% growth in last year’s third quarter.Year to date CHS is up +10% to beat the S&amp;P 500 and largely outperform its peer group’s -58%. Even better, over the last two years, CHS is up an impressive +294% to outperform the benchmark and its peer group’s -55%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $6 per share, CHS has a forward P/E of 6.6X. This is nicely below the industry average of 12.9X. Furthermore, CHS trades far below its decade-high of 290X and beneath the median of 16.2X. The price to sales paid for CHS is very favorable for investors at 0.3X on par with the industry average and below the benchmark. CHS appears to be a lower risk higher reward investment at its current levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThese retail stocks could be poised to go higher considering their low valuations and rising earnings estimate revisions. Both companies have a niche within the retail industry and could receive a boost from the holiday shopping season. This could be another catalyst for ROST and CHS stock after recently beating Q3 expectations.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now. Digital money transactions are rising swiftly in emerging markets as innovations increase. Banks, fintechs, and telecom companies must rapidly create strategies to take up market share. Digital payment transactions have grown quickly in emerging markets in the last two years, and the COVID-19 pandemic helped the transition to digital payments and e-commerce. People leaned more towards e-wallets, online payments, direct bank transfers, and companies partnered with digital money providers to extend their customer base during the peak pandemic years. Africa and Southeast Asia saw the fastest acceleration in digital payments, as these regions have lesser banking access, which leaves higher potential to tap into underserved populations. Another significant development of the pandemic years has been the popularity of “buy now, pay later”, a type of short-term credit used by companies which enables consumers to divide payments into installments.On November 24, Rodney Bain, co-founder and US president of payments fintech Apexx Global, told Financial Times: “The pandemic had a profound effect on digital payments, driven by two key factors. The fundamental inability for consumers to make in-store transactions during lockdowns and general discomfort with exposure to physical environments; and the economical strain felt by consumers during the pandemic.” Some of the best digital payments stocks to invest in include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Our Methodology We selected the following digital money stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and future growth prospects. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. Story continues11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy NowPachai Leknettip/Shutterstock.comBest Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now11.

On Topography, Futu’s user-centric product design built an intuitive front end and great user experience, while the digital native development framework built a solid &amp; reliable back end (including a self-developed order routing &amp; execution system for the HK market). This is a rare combination compared to both offline incumbents (who lack flashy front end &amp; UX) &amp; other new online disrupters (who lack solid infrastructure). On Commander factor, founder CEO Li Hua was a Tencent engineer in its early days with deep knowledge in product design and development. Li is said to be a fanatic product manager, to this day still at the front-line, alpha testing any new features. Based on analyses of these factors, I think Futu could compound its revenue at a very high rate with very high certainty and with strong operating leverage, putting our entry price very attractive compared to earning power in 3-5 years. Yet just as we finished building a small position, the price started to take off and more than tripled in a month. When such price action happens, it is obvious that Mr. Market has turned very euphoric to this name. I decided to trim but kept a reasonable position given its growth certainty.”10. Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) is a Texas-based financial technology and bank holding company that provides financial products to consumers and businesses in the United States. It operates through three segments – Consumer Services, Business to Business Services, and Money Movement Services. It is one of the best digital money stocks to monitor. On November 9, Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 and a revenue of $337.2 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.09 and $7.19 million, respectively. The company sees year-over-year growth in revenue per account and positive trends in its GO2bank product. Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal on November 14 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $21 from $25 following the Q3 earnings.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 22 hedge funds were long Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT), compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP is the largest position holder in the company, with 5.3 million shares worth $100.5 million. Here is what Steel City Capital has to say about Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“The Partnership recently established new positions in Green Dot (GDOT). As for GDOT, the company is a collection of old-school money access/money movement operations as well as new-school “FinTech” offerings. It is perhaps best known as the banking partner behind Wal-Mart’s prepaid MoneyCard debit card. Prepaid debt is among the least sexy financial service offerings in the market and I also suspect there’s a degree of snobbery among the investing class that its primary customers sit on a lower socio-economic rung. I think these factors are contributing to today’s opportunity.One of the emerging trends in the “FinTech” space is integration of banking and payment services by consumer facing companies. The idea is that by integrating these services, companies can collect more data on spending patterns, drive a “stickier” customer relationship/brand loyalty, and ultimately drive more sales. At the same time, such consumer facing companies either can’t, or won’t, build out these platforms on their own. Doing so would require, among other things, 1) a specific degree of technological expertise and 2) ownership and control of a banking institution. The latter of the two factors – owning a banking charter – is a significant deterrent to “going it alone.” Owning a bank requires costly and time consuming compliance (AML/KYC, etc.) and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Over the years, a long list of household names with financial services ambitions (including Wal-Mart) have either tried and failed, or proactively decided against owning and operating a bank. This is where someone like GDOT comes in, supplying the technical know-how and offering use of their banking charter without the headaches of actually becoming a regulated bank. In industry parlance, this has come to be known as “Banking-as-a-Service” or BaaS, for short.GDOT’s relationship with Wal-Mart has shifted more in the direction of BaaS than “just” prepaid debit with WalMart last year converting all of their existing prepaid accounts to demand deposit accounts intended to function similarly to a traditional banking account. MoneyCard now comes complete with an app and various features like overdraft protection, early payday, and cashback on Wal-Mart purchases. Beyond Wal-Mart, GDOT has expanded its BaaS offerings with other large brands. Another interesting use case is its Partnership with Intuit’s QuickBooks. When you open a new QuickBooks business account, you’re given the option to open a QuickBooks branded business checking account at the same time, which is powered on the back-end by GDOT. There’s a lot of white space out there for GDOT to work with additional consumer facing companies to integrate payments and other banking services into their platforms. I’ll acknowledge that GDOT is far from the only “player” in the arena, but the mere fact that they’ve already bagged a number of large name clients on the BaaS side (Intuit/QuickBooks, Apple/Apple Cash, Uber/Uber Checking) at least suggests their capabilities and offerings have passed an intense amount of scrutiny…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) is a California-based company that provides a platform for digital and mobile-first commerce in the United States, Canada, and internationally. The company's platform includes point-of-sale payment solutions for consumers, merchant commerce solutions, and a consumer-focused app. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)’s revenue of $361.62 million grew 34.2% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $1.15 million.On November 10, DA Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler reiterated a Buy rating on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) but lowered the price target on the shares to $32 from $50 after its FQ1 results and updated guidance. The company reported a solid quarter against increasing macro headwinds and while the stock sold off, he is not worried as underlying trends suggest Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) continues to significantly outperform peers, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 26 hedge funds were bullish on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the prior quarter. Colin Moran’s Abdiel Capital Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.16 million shares worth $40.7 million. Here is what Bireme Capital specifically said about Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “We recently covered our short position in Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) after a rapid decline brought the share price to ~$30 – down from our entry point above $100 – in only 7 months. We discussed Affirm in our Q4 letter, saying the following:Affirm is a “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) company founded by former PayPal CTO and cofounder Max Levchin. They provide installment loans to consumers, partnering with retail companies looking to drive higher sales. They have two primary products: a zero-fee installment loan for consumers with the best credit scores, and a more traditional product with 20%+ interest rates for subprime borrowers. Their stated plan is to disrupt the credit industry with more transparent, lower-fee loans. At a roughly $28b market cap at the start of 2022, AFRM stock was priced at more than 20x trailing sales, a steep price for a money-losing lender. While their early lead in online BNPL transactions and partnerships with fast-growing retailers like Peloton has fueled significant historical growth, a wave of competition has arrived… While the stock has already fallen sharply from where we initiated our short position, we think it could fall another ~40% to trade at 8x FY2022 sales.Interestingly, not much has changed about Affirm’s business from when it sported a $28b market cap. Estimates for 2022 sales have been inching up, from $1.25b at the start of the year to $1.35b today. And analysts estimate that the company will lose about $150m of EBITDA this year, slightly better than estimates in January. Rather than a story of deteriorating business fundamentals, this was a story of market participants simply deciding that a fast-growing, money-losing subprime lender – even a disruptive one – with around $1b of revenues should not be worth twenty-eight billion dollars. We think the current valuation is much more reasonable, and we do believe that Affirm will eventually generate profits from its lending platform, so we covered our short position.”8. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) is a Wisconsin-based company that provides payment and financial services technology worldwide. The company operates through Acceptance, Fintech, and Payments segments. It is one of the best digital money stocks to consider buying. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) raised its full-year 2022 outlook and now expects organic revenue growth of 11% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.48 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% from its prior view of $6.45 to $6.55. The consensus adjusted EPS came in at $6.48. On October 28, Citi analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar maintained a Buy recommendation on Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $115 from $122 following the “mixed” third quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) was part of 59 hedge fund portfolios, with collective stakes worth approximately $4 billion. Harris Associates held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 21.3 million shares worth $2 billion. Artisan Partners made the following comment about Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“While our list of potential candidates is filling up, we are being patient. We added two new positions in Q3: Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) and Heineken. Fiserv is a provider of financial technology, core processing and payment processing services to financial institutions and merchants. The company reports three segments: acceptance (merchant acquiring), payments &amp; networks (issuer processing and debit network), and fintech (core bank processing). Fiserv has strong market positions and scale across these businesses, but competitive intensity varies. In the acceptance segment, Fiserv owns Clover, a high-growth point-of-sale (POS) system forsmall and medium businesses, with similar annualized gross payment volume to Block’s Square. However, Fiserv is receiving little credit for Clover. The market is overly concerned about the competitive nature of merchant acquiring and legacy processors losing market share to new entrants. We believe Fiserv’s business is more resilient and will continue to grow in the medium term driven by its scale and Clover. Moreover, fintech and payments are good businesses that are undervalued by the market. Both businesses are in highly consolidated industries where scale advantages are critical, and revenues are sticky due to high switching costs. A high share of recurring revenue and profit, an attractive margin profile and high free cash flow conversion are characteristics that should provide downside protection, in our view. We started our position with shares selling for about 11X normalized operating profit. That is a below-average multiple for an above-average business.”7. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a Florida-based company that provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide.

(NYSE:FIS) declared a $0.47 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 23, to shareholders of record on December 9. On November 25, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev maintained a Buy recommendation on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $90 from $105. The company's Q3 results were disappointing, but management's focus on cost-cutting can help improve sentiment, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 60 hedge funds were bullish on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter. Select Equity Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $443.5 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also sold out of payments and financial software maker Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), choosing to concentrate our digital payments exposure in PayPal (PYPL), which we believe has a more attractive risk/reward at these levels and more internal levers to generate returns. We bought FIS in 2019 for its mix of offense and defense with banking software and services as a stable business and payments that could keep up with fintech. The shares outperformed the benchmark up to the sale, illustrating the resiliency of the core business; however, FIS has underperformed higher-growth payment names.”6. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based company that provides charge and credit payment card products worldwide. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the leading digital money stocks to invest in.

(NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best digital money stocks favored by smart investors. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest In10 Growth Stocks with Upside Potential Disclosure: None. 11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

He also reiterated his view that rates need to rise by at least another 1% to between 5% and 5.25%.Separately, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said the central bank will likely begin trimming rates in 2024, as inflation pressures eventually ease. He also said that borrowing costs need to rise further to bring down inflation.Their comments boosted the dollar, with the greenback jumping nearly 0.7% on Monday.

""Science, technology, engineering and math really intrigued me growing up,"" she says. ""It's all very dynamic. New innovations are introduced every day, and it's mind-blowing what you can do with science and technology.""Hanson brought that passion for STEM to her studies: Today, she is studying electrical and computer engineering at the University of Technology, Jamaica, and plans to become an electrical engineer after she graduates in 2024. To prepare for her future career, Hanson joined the EQUALS Her Digital Skills e-mentorship program, which helps college-aged women gain or enhance soft skills that improve professional development. Such skills include goal setting, recognizing personal strengths, problem-solving and time management. The eight-week program connects mentees with a V Teamer who works in a tech-related area for one-on-one mentorship.EQUALS Her Digital Skills was founded by EY; W4; Verizon Strategic Volunteer Partner GSMA, a trade organization representing the global mobile industry; and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which is the United Nations' specialized agency for information and communication technologies. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg is a founding member of ITU and Verizon Strategy Officer Rima Qureshi is a board deputy chair at GSMA. Through all of these partnerships, Her Digital Skills aims to provide access to free gender transformative, foundational digital skills training, e-skills badges, and e-mentoring for 1 million women and girls by 2026.""EQUALS Her Digital Skills addresses the urgent need to close the digital gender gap, in terms of access, skills and leadership,"" says Tamara Dancheva, senior international relations manager at GSMA. ""Women and girls are still growing up in a world that dictates their place in society based on their gender. [By] educating a woman, we are often also educating her family and her community, which, in turn, has an incredibly important socioeconomic impact, and it is critical for sustainable and inclusive future economic growth.""Story continuesThrough the EQUALS mentorship program, Hanson was paired with Kara Bailey, a senior manager in the network planning division at Verizon. Hailing from Rochester, New York, Bailey has been with the company for eight years; she decided to mentor after volunteering with Verizon Innovative Learning, speaking with school children about STEM careers. ""The engagement with the students was really rewarding,"" she says. ""I saw the e-mentoring program as a way to engage with a student on a more personal level. That's what drew me in.""For two months, Bailey and Hanson connected weekly via the Her Digital Skills email platform. Mentees complete activities based on a topic such as dealing with adversity, time management, setting goals and more. After completing the activity, they reflect with their mentor, who provides advice and personal insights based on what they learned.""I was happy I could make a new relationship with a professional through the program,"" Hanson says. ""It was a unique experience that felt personal, and it was good to have one-on-one interactions with someone who is experienced in the industry.""As a result of the mentorship, Hanson says her self-confidence and leadership skills increased, as did her teamwork and problem-solving skills. ""Time management was the main one that stuck with me,"" she says. ""There were times I was just unable to meet my daily or weekly goals. Having my mentor share techniques that helped me manage my time properly made me more productive and efficient.""The mentees aren't the only ones who benefit from the experience. Bailey says the mentorship had a lot of memorable moments, but one stood out.""Brianna and I were talking about overcoming obstacles and, at the time, I was finishing my MBA, working on a difficult project,"" Bailey says. ""Our conversation reminded me of one of the best pieces of advice I ever got: ‘Fail fast. You're never going to learn if you don't fail, so do it fast and keep moving forward.' Not only did I share that with Brianna, but it also reminded me to keep applying it to my own personal challenges.""Inspired to be the bestFor Jamie Leon, a retail small-medium business account manager in La Habra, California, at Verizon, mentoring with the Her Digital Skills program through Citizen Verizon Volunteers was a natural fit. ""I'm passionate about women's professional development and growth,"" Leon says. ""I thought it would be a great opportunity to share my experience with another woman who was looking for that type of mentorship.""Leon mentored Princess Gaynor, a third-year college student at the University of the Commonwealth Caribbean who is pursuing a degree in information technology. After she graduates, Gaynor plans to become a web developer and entrepreneur. Gaynor says the experience positively contributed to her knowledge of the STEM field and her overall confidence.""She really inspired me to feel like I had meaning in life and that I could become the best version of myself, if I put myself to the test,"" Gaynor says. ""She was an awesome mentor. I just loved communicating with her.""For Leon, hearing how Gaynor used the concepts they discussed while leading classmates at school was gratifying. ""Seeing her sense of empowerment and development was really rewarding,"" Leon says. ""It was exciting to see the impact our conversations had. She's extremely driven - she knows what she wants, and she's going after it.""The biggest impact Gaynor hopes to make is within her community. ""I hope I can [inspire] other teenagers to achieve their dreams, especially the ones who are in inner-city communities like myself. I want to help them make a better way in life and move forward with their goals, no matter what they are.""As the season of giving approaches, how will you give back?

Here is what he said:The US remains an oasis despite the chaos in the world. Americans are naturally optimistic, and our consumer-driven society so far has skirted a recession. However, the Fed is trying to re-establish its credibility by raising key interest rates and threatening to curtail existing economic growth. Engineering a ""soft landing"" has proven to be next to impossible in the past. I expect inflation to ""crack"" in September and decelerate to less than a 4% annual pace. The Fed has traditionally overshot when raising key interest rates, so it is imperative that after pricking the housing bubble that the Fed hits the ""pause button"" to ensure that the US economy does not slip into a recession. I will show investors my best recession-resistant stocks that I expect to prosper regardless of whether the US economy slips into a recession.Story continuesHaving purchased 42 new stocks, and sold out of 55 positions, Louis &amp; Navellier's most notable holdings in Q3 2022 include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”6.

The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 8.2% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 9.5%. AmerisourceBergen’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other one, the average surprise being 2.5%.AmerisourceBergen is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its robust World Courier business. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 performance and strength in its U.S. healthcare solutions business are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and headwinds from contract renewals persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversStrength in World Courier Business: Investors are upbeat about World Courier’s solid foothold in global specialty logistics services, which has been driving compelling volume growth and overall performance for ABC. The business has been delivering robust results in recent times and the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 was not an exception.World Courier’s robust business fundamentals position it for another year of strong growth. Going forward, World Courier is expected to continue to design and deploy patient-centric and forward-thinking transport services in new areas like in-home clinical trials, making treatments in patients’ homes possible in virtually every therapeutic area.Strength in U.S. Healthcare Solutions Business: Investors are optimistic about the segment deriving benefits from increasing volume and an expanding customer base. In fiscal fourth-quarter 2022, this segment reflected a strong year-over-year revenue uptick on the back of an increase in specialty product sales coupled with overall market growth.Story continuesImprovement in year-over-year segmental operating income was also impressive. Higher gross profit contributed to the upside.Strong Q4 Results: AmerisourceBergen’s robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results buoy optimism. The company’s robust segmental performance in the quarter is encouraging. AmerisourceBergen’s introduction of AB Health Ventures — a dedicated corporate venture capital fund — focused on investing in and collaborating with emerging healthcare startup companies that are involved in transforming healthcare for people and animals worldwide deserves mention. The expansion of both margins bodes well.DownsidesContract Renewals a Headwind: The company’s largest customer, Walgreens, accounted for a significant proportion of total revenues. The loss of any major customer will adversely impact the top line. AmerisourceBergen extended its 10-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement with Walgreens Boot Alliance for three years. The contract will now expire in 2026. Hence, the possibility of a headwind in the near term remains.Stiff Competition: AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related healthcare services market. The company’s primary competitors are key MedTech players, along with national generic distributors and regional distributors. The company faces additional competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors, and packaging and healthcare technology companies.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

The favorable findings were presented during a late-breaking clinical trial session at PCR London Valves 2022 and were published simultaneously in EuroIntervention.The ACURATE neo2 Aortic Valve System, which received the CE Mark in 2020, is being assessed in the currently enrolling ACURATE Investigational Device Exemption trial in the United States and Canada. However, the system is an investigational device and not available for sale in the United States.The latest positive PMCF study outcome of ACURATE neo2 Aortic Valve System in patients is a significant stepping stone for Boston Scientific’s Structural Heart Therapies business (under the broader Cardiovascular segment) across the world.Significance of the ResultPer Boston Scientific, the primary safety endpoint of all-cause mortality was very low at 30 days in this European study. The data also demonstrated that paravalvular leak (PVL) in patients were lower side.Per an expert associated with the PMCF study, the foundational data set now presents post-market surveillance results that validate the use of the current-generation ACURATE neo2 valve for the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis. The expert also added that the data suggest that the annular sealing technology of the current-generation ACURATE neo2 valve will likely minimize leakage around the valve, thus providing greater improvement in PVL than with the prior-generation ACURATE neo valve.The current-generation neo valve will also likely maintain single-digit permanent pacemaker rates, thereby leading to improved long-term patient outcomes.Per management, the trial data illustrate the success of meaningful and differentiated enhancements included in the design of the ACURATE neo2 valve, which includes low rates of PVL, excellent hemodynamic performance and high rates of procedural success and safety, among others.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Blueweave Consulting, the global structural heart devices market was worth $11.63 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $24.16 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 11.2%.

The company also registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business amid several macroeconomic issues.The Cardiovascular segment also recorded robust revenue improvement, where sales from its sub-segments, Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions, were solid.In September, Boston Scientific announced results from the PROTECTED TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) clinical trial evaluating the SENTINEL Cerebral Protection System.

220,a27a10f4-dac1-3981-aea2-7c3fb3625bf9,TRV,2022-11-29,10 Best Landlord Insurance Companies,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-landlord-insurance-companies-122753137.html,1669638473,STORY,"['WRB', 'TRV', 'HIG-PG', 'BRK-B']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best landlord insurance companies. If you want to skip our introduction to the industry, then head on over to 5 Best Landlord Insurance Companies. Insurance, like banking, is right at the center of any developed economy. The simple premise of this multi-billion dollar industry involves subscribers pooling their resources together to create a sufficient reserve that can help if some of them face untoward accidents or events. Their resources and premiums are determined through sophisticated mathematical models which use concepts such as probability and stochastic modeling to determine what amount users should be charged and what level of resources the insurance company should keep in reserve to 'ensure' that it can meet all potential claims.Looking at the numbers, the property insurance market is one of the largest in the world, with its worth not in millions or billions, but in trillions of dollars. This is unsurprising, as the property sector itself deals with some of the lucrative assets that money can get a hold of, and often involves funding from large entities such as governments to ensure that there is sufficient capital to set up and build new construction projects. A research report from Maximize Market Research estimates that the sector was worth a whopping $1.6 trillion in 2021, and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% to sit at $2.85 trillion by the end of 2029. The CAGR is notable as trillion dollar industries, such as crude oil, rarely have high single digit growth rates because they have matured.Landlord Insurance Industry: An AnalysisLandlord insurance is one segment of the property insurance market, with some others being firms that provide insurance to homeowners and renters.Crucially for us though, Maximize Market Research believes that the landlord insurance segment will be the fastest growing out of the different ones mentioned above. Not only was this sector the largest constituent of the property insurance pie in 2021, but it will grow primarily due to the disruptions ushered in by the coronavirus pandemic and other natural disasters as landlords will seek greater security for their properties.Story continuesAnother report, this time from Research Dive, dives into the home insurance market. This market will grow at a 6.8% CAGR and sit at $407 billion by the end of 2029. More importantly, it also provides us with some facts about the landlord subsegment. According to Research Dive, during the same time period, landlord insurance will grow to $183 billion. A key factor behind this growth will be the growing home prices, as the research firm believes that more people will turn to rent as the primary means for their living arrangement, which in turn will drive up the insurance purchased by landlords.Finally, Allied Market Research also takes a look at the global property insurance market. It estimates that the industry was worth $15.6 trillion in 2021 and once again, despite this absolutely massive size, it will nevertheless grow at a 9.5% CAGR to sit at $39 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Some factors for this unbelievable growth and scope include market volatility and unpredictability in global financial markets. Additionally, Allied Market Research points out that growth in information technology and connectivity will also drive the growth.Today's piece will look at the top landlord insurance providers in the industry and the renowned players are Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Allianz SE (ETR:ALV.DE), and State Farm Insurance.Copyright: zhukovsky / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We sifted through the countless private and public landlord insurance providers to sift out the best companies.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $186.11 in the previous session. Genuine Parts has gained 32.7% since the start of the year compared to the -40.6% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -2.3% return for the Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 20, 2022, Genuine Parts reported EPS of $2.23 versus consensus estimate of $2.03.For the current fiscal year, Genuine Parts is expected to post earnings of $8.16 per share on $21.88 billion in revenues. This represents a 18.09% change in EPS on a 15.94% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.65 per share on $22.42 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 5.95% and 2.49%, respectively.Valuation MetricsGenuine Parts may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Genuine Parts has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 22.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 14X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 20.6X versus its peer group's average of 10.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.91. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Genuine Parts currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Genuine Parts meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Genuine Parts shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not helping market sentiment are signs large U.S. companies stand to get swept up into the contentious health-turned-political situation.On Tuesday, Disney (DIS) Shanghai closed its gates just four days after reopening them. The company said in a statement the closures were to comply with “the requirement of pandemic prevention and control.”On Monday, Bloomberg reported that Apple (AAPL) could see a six million unit shortfall in iPhones this year amid manufacturing pressures at a key China Foxconn plant.""With the head scratching zero Covid policy in China now reaching a tipping point and protests across the country, Apple is essentially caught in the cross-fire heading into the all-important Christmas time period,"" opined Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.Here's what top Wall Street strategists are saying about the contentious situation.Hui Shan of Goldman Sachs""Local governments struggle to balance quickly bringing the spread of the virus under control and obeying the '20 measures' which mandate a more targeted approach. The central government may soon need to choose between more lockdowns and more Covid outbreaks. The current situation imposes further downside risk to our below-consensus Q4 GDP forecast. Our 30% subjective probability of reopening before Q2 next year includes some chance of a forced and disorderly exit.""Xiangrong Yu of Citi""The Covid situation in China may have triggered concerns again. The direction of reopening is very clear, in our view, and we don't think the government will double down on pandemic control measures. Whether China will head into a forced reopening will depend on the Covid situation, but the government still has enough room to maneuver, in our view. We maintain our base case that reopening will gain momentum post the [National People's Congress on March 5] next year, and see higher risk of an accelerated reopening.""Story continuesEpidemic control workers wear PPE to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as they rest on a park bench in an area where communities are in lockdown on November 29, 2022 in Beijing, China. (Photo by Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)Michael Hirson of 22V Research""The possibility of a chaotic pivot scenario this winter is rising as the population, as well as local governments, are clearly reaching exhaustion in maintaining zero-Covid policies. If protests continue to grow, or if the population becomes less compliant with Covid restrictions, local officials may conclude that the political risk of maintaining harsh restrictions outweighs the risks of letting outbreaks spread. The leadership may be forced to accept this outcome, at least in some localities, in the face of local exhaustion and Omicron’s high transmissibility. A chaotic pivot is likely to be highly disruptive to the economy – quite possibly worse than zero-Covid, at least in the near term.""Hirson added that a chaotic pivot would be ""Chinese authorities essentially abandoning – by choice or by force – the hope of preventing a surge in cases through testing and lockdowns. But this does not mean that China 'lies flat': local governments will need to maintain tight restrictions in areas at risk of seeing the hospital system overwhelmed. Moreover, a chaotic pivot scenario would also damage the economy through increased voluntary restrictions on behavior from households worried about infection. Simply put, while a chaotic pivot could potentially shorten the timeline for China’s eventual reopening, the overall economic and social risks would be high.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

The old contract expired on Oct. 1, 2022, but the two parties have agreed to maintain a status quo till a new one is reached.The STCU is a powerful force. Two years ago, in October 2020, Disney was planning to move 5,299 full-time workers and 8,857 part-time workers from furlough to layoff status. Almost all of the part-time workers were hit, but STCU negotiated to ensure no full-time cast member was laid off.Disney World workers’ wages, by the digits70,000: The number of workers at Florida’s Disney World.

And it’ll likely bring in loads more, especially given the planned ticket price hikes.Story continuesIger’s immediate focus is on plugging the financial holes that Bob Chapek, his predecessor, left in the streaming business.Under Chapek, Disney+ increased its content spending to around $30 billion this fiscal year, while charging customers far less than rivals. The customers poured in, but so did losses for the unit, which reached $1.5 billion.Now Disney will prioritize making money with streaming rather than just adding subscribers, Iger said during a town hall yesterday (Nov. 28), as the Wall Street Journal reported.Charted: Bob Iger’s return is helping Disney’s ailing stockdatawrapper-chart-oNMRbRelated stories🌬️ In a plot twist, Disney is bringing back CEO Bob Iger🌎 Under Bob Iger, Disney took over the world🇨🇳 Disney’s “Avatar 2"" return to China could be stalled by covid-19 lockdownsMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

To best support customers, ComEd is always trialing and enhancing solutions to deliver new levels of resiliency in a cost-effective manner. BESS solutions offer one alternative method; this demonstration will help identify whether localized storage solutions can improve reliability and resiliency in northern Illinois to limit the length and frequency of power outages -especially in more remote, and difficult to access, locations on the grid.""Building on our nation-leading reliability, ComEd continues to seek solutions to improve our performance for customers, throughout our service territory,"" said Michelle Blaise, Senior Vice President of Technical Services at ComEd. ""Hyper-localized solutions like this BESS demonstration are another key tool to ensure outstanding reliability and resiliency, even as the grid is challenged in new ways by more severe weather associated with climate change, while preparing for the growth of renewable energy, and the electrification of transportation, buildings and industry.""The deployed BESS solutions reduce the impact of outages these customers might experience by enabling them to maintain a power source when their portion of the main grid is damaged or experiences a fault. While ComEd line crews assess the damage and restore power to the area, the impacted homes are powered by the BESS solutions. Once the outage has been resolved, customers are reconnected to the grid. When determining the locations for these BESS deployments, ComEd identified customer areas that experienced some of the most challenging outages from 2017 to 2020.Story continuesThe technology demonstration utilizes various batteries from Sunverge Energy Inc. and Mesa Technical Associates to support ongoing grid management including a Sunverge battery with 6.5kW / 28kWh capacity, and Mesa batteries with 75kW / 200kWh and 75kW / 350kWh capacity. Collectively, these batteries support 23 residential customers and can provide those homes with enough power to maintain typical energy use for 8 hours while ComEd line crews address the power outage on the main system.These BESS solutions are some of the many investments ComEd has deployed throughout the region to improve customers’ reliability. Since 2011, ComEd has advanced smart grid improvements to help customers avoid more than 19 million outages, saving more than $3 billion in outage-related costs. This investment has paid off – so far in 2022, more than 3.6 million of ComEd’s more than 4 million customers have experienced, on average, either zero or no more than one outage.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

Blackstone is the largest alternative asset manager in the world with nearly $1 trillion of assets under management (AUM) and $700 billion of fee-earning capital. More importantly, 40% of Blackstone’s AUM is perpetual in nature and 90% of revenue is tied to capital that is perpetual or long term in nature. We have long admired Blackstone due to its strong brand, premier global franchise, loyal investor base, nearly 40-year superior investment track record, and talented executive team anchored by CEO Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray.The company has been at the forefront of new product innovation, and we believe that Blackstone will continue to be the winner against an appealing industry backdrop with durable growth characteristics, underpinned by: i) a large and growing addressable market in alternative investments of $10 trillion today vs. $250 trillion for stocks and bonds; ii) institutions continuing to allocate increasing amounts of capital to alternatives (due to historical lower volatility and higher returns); and iii) the opportunity in the retail/high net worth channel that is less than 5% penetrated (versus approximately 30% for institutions)…” (Click here to read the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest In10 Growth Stocks with Upside PotentialDisclosure.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Gas Stocks To Buy Now. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the shortage of natural gas, further hiking up prices for consumers and businesses alike. This resulted in the use of alternative fuels and demand destruction. It also creates longer-term unpredictably in the natural gas market, especially in emerging nations where it used to play a primary role in energy transitions. According to the International Energy Agency, the Asia Pacific region and the industrial sector are the core drivers of growth in the natural gas market, accounting for 50% and 60% of the growth to 2025, respectively. However, the Asia Pacific region will be subject to high risk from rising prices and slow economic growth.As per IEA data, gas production in North America rose by 2.1% in 2021 although there was limited capital expenditure in the US upstream sector, driven by higher domestic and export demand. Per IEA’s estimates, North America holds a leading position in the intermediate-term in the global growth of natural gas supply, with nearly 85 bcm added between 2021 and 2025. The region represents nearly 40% of the net increase in production capacity and over half of the worldwide net production growth during 2021 and 2025. Some of the best gas stocks to invest in include ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC). Our Methodology We selected the following gas stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and solidity of dividend profiles.

We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”7. Suncor Energy Inc.

(NYSE:SU) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “Also within the structural bucket, we added to our commodity exposure with the purchase of Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU). Suncor, a past holding, is a Canadian integrated oil company where we capitalized on attractive valuation due to a COVID-19-induced slowdown. We expect recovery in oil demand and strong pricing will result in faster than expected free cash flow growth and financial deleveraging.The structural bucket has the shortest investment horizon across the spectrum of growth companies we target in the Strategy. We closely monitor the macro impacts and turnaround progress of these companies and will be disciplined sellers when the thesis for a holding plays out.”6.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Increases: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 784 for the week ended Nov 23. The figure is higher thanthe prior week’s count of 782. Thus, the tally increased in six of the prior seven weeks. The current national rig count is higher than the year-ago level of 569.The onshore rigs in the week ended Nov 23 totaled 764, higher than the prior-week count of 762. In offshore resources, 17 rigs were operating, in line with the prior week’s count.U.S. Oil Rig Count Rises: The oil rig count was 627 for the week ended Nov 23, higher than the prior week’s figure of 623. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is up from the year-ago figure of 467.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Declines: Natural gas rig count of 155 was lower than the prior-week figure of 157. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 102. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.3% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 23 units, in line with the prior-week count. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 761 is higher than the prior-week level of 759.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Flat: GoM rig count was 16 units, all oil-directed. The count was flat compared with the prior-week number.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 348, higher than the prior week's count of 345. The tally increased in seven of the prior 11 weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $70-per-barrel mark, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for further rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario.

The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Oracle’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Oracle What Is Oracle Worth?Good news, investors! Oracle is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $116.65, but it is currently trading at US$81.39 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Oracle’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Oracle?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Oracle. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ORCL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ORCL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ORCL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you want to dive deeper into Oracle, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Most Valuable Bootstrapped Companies In The World. The allure of making it big in the business world, disrupting industries, and making millions is what drives entrepreneurs to take risks and set up new firms. Setting up a new company is perhaps among the most difficult tasks in the world, as it requires a multi-year commitment and solving new challenges almost every day. However, the returns of this struggle are exponential in many cases.A key challenge when setting up a new firm is finding capital. There are a couple of ways in which founders can secure funding, and these include seeking the aid of outside professional investors or relying on their own capital or that of close friends and family. The latter is called bootstrapping, and it has its caveats and benefits since while raising capital from outside sources requires ceding control, using your own money to finance a startup carries the risk of a complete loss of savings and other funds.An example of the toll that the latter takes on a founder is the SpaceX billionaire Mr. Elon Musk. During the 2008 financial crisis, and when his company suffered its first three rocket launch failures, Mr. Musk would reportedly wake up screaming at night after experiencing nightmares. At the time, the executive had invested all his money into Tesla and SpaceX, and as both failed to turn a profit or execute successfully, his mental health paid the price alongside his bank account.Fast forward to the current day, and SpaceX is one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world. Alongside the rocket company that is the darling of the aerospace world and the public sector these days, some other top firms that were bootstrapped initially but then made it big are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Story continuesOur Methodology We took a broad look at the business world to sift out the biggest names right now. Their history was then studied to determine if, during their early stages, they relied exclusively on non-professional funding to set up their operations and start generating revenues.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now. Digital money transactions are rising swiftly in emerging markets as innovations increase. Banks, fintechs, and telecom companies must rapidly create strategies to take up market share. Digital payment transactions have grown quickly in emerging markets in the last two years, and the COVID-19 pandemic helped the transition to digital payments and e-commerce. People leaned more towards e-wallets, online payments, direct bank transfers, and companies partnered with digital money providers to extend their customer base during the peak pandemic years. Africa and Southeast Asia saw the fastest acceleration in digital payments, as these regions have lesser banking access, which leaves higher potential to tap into underserved populations. Another significant development of the pandemic years has been the popularity of “buy now, pay later”, a type of short-term credit used by companies which enables consumers to divide payments into installments.On November 24, Rodney Bain, co-founder and US president of payments fintech Apexx Global, told Financial Times: “The pandemic had a profound effect on digital payments, driven by two key factors. The fundamental inability for consumers to make in-store transactions during lockdowns and general discomfort with exposure to physical environments; and the economical strain felt by consumers during the pandemic.” Some of the best digital payments stocks to invest in include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Our Methodology We selected the following digital money stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and future growth prospects. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. Story continues11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy NowPachai Leknettip/Shutterstock.comBest Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now11. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is a Hong Kong-based company that operates an online brokerage and wealth management platform in Hong Kong and internationally. The company offers trading, clearing, settlement services, margin financing, securities lending services, and stock yield enhancement programs. On November 21, the company reported a Q3 GAAP EPADS of $0.68, beating market estimates by $0.07. The revenue of $247.9 million also outperformed Wall Street estimates by $19.75 million. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)’s total number of paying clients increased 23.8% year-over-year to 1,444,955 as of September 30, 2022.Investment advisory DBS Bank initiated coverage of Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) on October 24 with a Buy rating and a $55 price target.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 14 funds reported owning stakes worth $113.3 million in Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 9 funds in the prior quarter worth $153.2 million. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares valued at $49 million. Like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is one of the best  digital money stocks to invest in. Here is what Tao Value has to say about Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“Futu is a new “Opportunistic” position. It is an HK based online brokerage &amp; wealth management platform with deep roots in technology. Futu sits in the confluence of 3 strong favorable forces of Meteorology, Topography &amp; Commander, yet was underpriced at the time of our entry. In terms of Meteorology, there is a huge addressable market of Chinese domestic middle to upper classes’ wealth being deployed to overseas assets allocation in the next decade. Additionally, the incumbents being disrupted are extremely weak in their digital transformation. On Topography, Futu’s user-centric product design built an intuitive front end and great user experience, while the digital native development framework built a solid &amp; reliable back end (including a self-developed order routing &amp; execution system for the HK market). This is a rare combination compared to both offline incumbents (who lack flashy front end &amp; UX) &amp; other new online disrupters (who lack solid infrastructure). On Commander factor, founder CEO Li Hua was a Tencent engineer in its early days with deep knowledge in product design and development. Li is said to be a fanatic product manager, to this day still at the front-line, alpha testing any new features. Based on analyses of these factors, I think Futu could compound its revenue at a very high rate with very high certainty and with strong operating leverage, putting our entry price very attractive compared to earning power in 3-5 years. Yet just as we finished building a small position, the price started to take off and more than tripled in a month. When such price action happens, it is obvious that Mr. Market has turned very euphoric to this name. I decided to trim but kept a reasonable position given its growth certainty.”10. Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) is a Texas-based financial technology and bank holding company that provides financial products to consumers and businesses in the United States. It operates through three segments – Consumer Services, Business to Business Services, and Money Movement Services. It is one of the best digital money stocks to monitor. On November 9, Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 and a revenue of $337.2 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.09 and $7.19 million, respectively. The company sees year-over-year growth in revenue per account and positive trends in its GO2bank product. Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal on November 14 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $21 from $25 following the Q3 earnings.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 22 hedge funds were long Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT), compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP is the largest position holder in the company, with 5.3 million shares worth $100.5 million. Here is what Steel City Capital has to say about Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“The Partnership recently established new positions in Green Dot (GDOT). As for GDOT, the company is a collection of old-school money access/money movement operations as well as new-school “FinTech” offerings. It is perhaps best known as the banking partner behind Wal-Mart’s prepaid MoneyCard debit card. Prepaid debt is among the least sexy financial service offerings in the market and I also suspect there’s a degree of snobbery among the investing class that its primary customers sit on a lower socio-economic rung. I think these factors are contributing to today’s opportunity.One of the emerging trends in the “FinTech” space is integration of banking and payment services by consumer facing companies. The idea is that by integrating these services, companies can collect more data on spending patterns, drive a “stickier” customer relationship/brand loyalty, and ultimately drive more sales. At the same time, such consumer facing companies either can’t, or won’t, build out these platforms on their own. Doing so would require, among other things, 1) a specific degree of technological expertise and 2) ownership and control of a banking institution. The latter of the two factors – owning a banking charter – is a significant deterrent to “going it alone.” Owning a bank requires costly and time consuming compliance (AML/KYC, etc.) and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Over the years, a long list of household names with financial services ambitions (including Wal-Mart) have either tried and failed, or proactively decided against owning and operating a bank. This is where someone like GDOT comes in, supplying the technical know-how and offering use of their banking charter without the headaches of actually becoming a regulated bank. In industry parlance, this has come to be known as “Banking-as-a-Service” or BaaS, for short.GDOT’s relationship with Wal-Mart has shifted more in the direction of BaaS than “just” prepaid debit with WalMart last year converting all of their existing prepaid accounts to demand deposit accounts intended to function similarly to a traditional banking account. MoneyCard now comes complete with an app and various features like overdraft protection, early payday, and cashback on Wal-Mart purchases. Beyond Wal-Mart, GDOT has expanded its BaaS offerings with other large brands. Another interesting use case is its Partnership with Intuit’s QuickBooks. When you open a new QuickBooks business account, you’re given the option to open a QuickBooks branded business checking account at the same time, which is powered on the back-end by GDOT. There’s a lot of white space out there for GDOT to work with additional consumer facing companies to integrate payments and other banking services into their platforms. I’ll acknowledge that GDOT is far from the only “player” in the arena, but the mere fact that they’ve already bagged a number of large name clients on the BaaS side (Intuit/QuickBooks, Apple/Apple Cash, Uber/Uber Checking) at least suggests their capabilities and offerings have passed an intense amount of scrutiny…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) is a California-based company that provides a platform for digital and mobile-first commerce in the United States, Canada, and internationally. The company's platform includes point-of-sale payment solutions for consumers, merchant commerce solutions, and a consumer-focused app. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)’s revenue of $361.62 million grew 34.2% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $1.15 million.On November 10, DA Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler reiterated a Buy rating on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) but lowered the price target on the shares to $32 from $50 after its FQ1 results and updated guidance. The company reported a solid quarter against increasing macro headwinds and while the stock sold off, he is not worried as underlying trends suggest Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) continues to significantly outperform peers, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 26 hedge funds were bullish on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the prior quarter. Colin Moran’s Abdiel Capital Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.16 million shares worth $40.7 million. Here is what Bireme Capital specifically said about Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “We recently covered our short position in Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) after a rapid decline brought the share price to ~$30 – down from our entry point above $100 – in only 7 months. We discussed Affirm in our Q4 letter, saying the following:Affirm is a “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) company founded by former PayPal CTO and cofounder Max Levchin. They provide installment loans to consumers, partnering with retail companies looking to drive higher sales. They have two primary products: a zero-fee installment loan for consumers with the best credit scores, and a more traditional product with 20%+ interest rates for subprime borrowers. Their stated plan is to disrupt the credit industry with more transparent, lower-fee loans. At a roughly $28b market cap at the start of 2022, AFRM stock was priced at more than 20x trailing sales, a steep price for a money-losing lender. While their early lead in online BNPL transactions and partnerships with fast-growing retailers like Peloton has fueled significant historical growth, a wave of competition has arrived… While the stock has already fallen sharply from where we initiated our short position, we think it could fall another ~40% to trade at 8x FY2022 sales.Interestingly, not much has changed about Affirm’s business from when it sported a $28b market cap. Estimates for 2022 sales have been inching up, from $1.25b at the start of the year to $1.35b today. And analysts estimate that the company will lose about $150m of EBITDA this year, slightly better than estimates in January. Rather than a story of deteriorating business fundamentals, this was a story of market participants simply deciding that a fast-growing, money-losing subprime lender – even a disruptive one – with around $1b of revenues should not be worth twenty-eight billion dollars. We think the current valuation is much more reasonable, and we do believe that Affirm will eventually generate profits from its lending platform, so we covered our short position.”8. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) is a Wisconsin-based company that provides payment and financial services technology worldwide. The company operates through Acceptance, Fintech, and Payments segments. It is one of the best digital money stocks to consider buying. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) raised its full-year 2022 outlook and now expects organic revenue growth of 11% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.48 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% from its prior view of $6.45 to $6.55. The consensus adjusted EPS came in at $6.48. On October 28, Citi analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar maintained a Buy recommendation on Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $115 from $122 following the “mixed” third quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) was part of 59 hedge fund portfolios, with collective stakes worth approximately $4 billion. Harris Associates held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 21.3 million shares worth $2 billion. Artisan Partners made the following comment about Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“While our list of potential candidates is filling up, we are being patient. We added two new positions in Q3: Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) and Heineken. Fiserv is a provider of financial technology, core processing and payment processing services to financial institutions and merchants. The company reports three segments: acceptance (merchant acquiring), payments &amp; networks (issuer processing and debit network), and fintech (core bank processing). Fiserv has strong market positions and scale across these businesses, but competitive intensity varies. In the acceptance segment, Fiserv owns Clover, a high-growth point-of-sale (POS) system forsmall and medium businesses, with similar annualized gross payment volume to Block’s Square. However, Fiserv is receiving little credit for Clover. The market is overly concerned about the competitive nature of merchant acquiring and legacy processors losing market share to new entrants. We believe Fiserv’s business is more resilient and will continue to grow in the medium term driven by its scale and Clover. Moreover, fintech and payments are good businesses that are undervalued by the market. Both businesses are in highly consolidated industries where scale advantages are critical, and revenues are sticky due to high switching costs. A high share of recurring revenue and profit, an attractive margin profile and high free cash flow conversion are characteristics that should provide downside protection, in our view. We started our position with shares selling for about 11X normalized operating profit. That is a below-average multiple for an above-average business.”7. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a Florida-based company that provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide. It operates through Merchant Solutions, Banking Solutions, and Capital Market Solutions segments. On October 20, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) declared a $0.47 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 23, to shareholders of record on December 9. On November 25, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev maintained a Buy recommendation on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $90 from $105. The company's Q3 results were disappointing, but management's focus on cost-cutting can help improve sentiment, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 60 hedge funds were bullish on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter. Select Equity Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $443.5 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also sold out of payments and financial software maker Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), choosing to concentrate our digital payments exposure in PayPal (PYPL), which we believe has a more attractive risk/reward at these levels and more internal levers to generate returns. We bought FIS in 2019 for its mix of offense and defense with banking software and services as a stable business and payments that could keep up with fintech. The shares outperformed the benchmark up to the sale, illustrating the resiliency of the core business; however, FIS has underperformed higher-growth payment names.”6. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based company that provides charge and credit payment card products worldwide. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the leading digital money stocks to invest in. On November 21, UBS analyst Erika Najarian initiated coverage of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) with a Neutral rating and a $168 price target as part of a broader research note on U.S. Consumer &amp; Specialty Finance names. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 68 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $24.8 billion in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter worth $25.2 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest position holder in the company, with 151.6 million shares valued at $20.45 billion. In addition to Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best digital money stocks favored by smart investors. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest In10 Growth Stocks with Upside Potential Disclosure: None. 11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Neighbouring Russia is Kazakhstan's main trading partner.In a statement, the U.S.-based company said that its ""licensee in Kazakhstan has temporarily closed all of its restaurants due to local supply issues. We are working together to resume operations as quickly as possible.""Food Solutions, the Kazakh licensee company, announced the closure on Nov. 17 and cited ""local supply issues."" It did not respond to requests for comment.Over the past six years, McDonald's has become a major player on the fast food market of Kazakhstan, a Central Asian nation of 20 million people, growing its network to 24 restaurants.The company had sourced some supplies abroad, including beef and chicken. The latter was sourced from Russia's Miratorg, according to its website.After Russia invaded Ukraine in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", McDonald's exited Russia, selling all the restaurants it owned to a local licensee in May.Food Solutions, which belongs to prominent Kazakh businessman Kairat Boranbayev, also started looking for suppliers elsewhere and stopped buying Russian products at some point, a source close to the company said.Another source said it started running out of packaging materials, also imported from Russia, in recent months, and had to shrink its menu. Both sources were not authorised to talk publicly about the matter.The source said the licensee was now awaiting deliveries from other suppliers and planned to reopen its restaurants in December. It was unclear where the decision to ditch Russian suppliers originated.Story continuesMarr Russia, one of the Kazakh company's Russian suppliers, said it never worked directly with McDonald's, dealing with its Kazakh logistics partner HAVI instead. It therefore could not say whether sales to Kazakhstan have stopped, it added. HAVI declined to comment.Miratorg said it was a supplier for Vkusno &amp; Tochka, the Russian successor to McDonald's, and did not directly address the question of Kazakh sales.Cargill Russia, also previously mentioned by Food Solutions among its suppliers, said it had sold the business that dealt with McDonald's to Russian meat producer Cherkizovo, which did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Serik Zhumangarin, asked about McDonald's at a briefing on Tuesday, said he could not disclose the reasons for its temporary closure and added that the government was helping the company localise its supplies.(Additional reporting by Olzhas Auyezov in Almaty and Hilary Russ in New York; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)]"

The company’s increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. It is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets.Robust digitalization will help the company in driving long-term growth and capturing market share. It is planning to open more than 1,800 restaurants globally in 2022, which includes 500 openings in the United States and IOM segment and 1,300 (including nearly 800 in China) inaugurations in the IDL market.However, restaurant closures in Russia and Ukraine, coupled with inflationary pressures on labor and commodities, remain headwinds.

Also, the company’s high dependence on overseas revenues is worrisome. The rise in equity market volatility and a fall in asset prices make us apprehensive.However, BlackRock has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. Its third-quarter 2022 results were aided by lower costs.BlackRock continues to restructure the equity business, which, along with strategic acquisitions, will keep supporting revenue growth, and help expand market share and footprints globally.

The company boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects has been met successfully.BP has set an aggressive energy transition plan to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy. Currently, high oil prices are aiding the company’s upstream operations. Notably, BP announced plans to execute a $3.5-billion share buyback, which is expected to be completed before reporting the third-quarter results.However, the company’s balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, thereby limiting its financial flexibility.

Vkusno &amp; tochka (""Tasty and that's it"") restaurants started opening in June.But one franchisee, Razvitie Rost, a subsidiary of Rosinter Restaurants, kept its nine restaurants open for months, a move that displeased Vkusno &amp; tochka boss Oleg Paroev and highlighted how challenging it can be for Western brands to fully extricate their brands.""As of Dec. 1, Razvitie Rost enterprises will continue their work in Russia under the Vkusno &amp; tochka brand,"" Rosinter said in a statement.Rosinter's restaurants, at train stations and airports in Moscow and St Petersburg, continued operating without McDonald's signs, which were covered up.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$256 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$275. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was 53% of Ian Borden's holding.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of McDonald's shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like McDonald's better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Are McDonald's Insiders Buying Or Selling?We have seen a bit of insider selling at McDonald's, over the last three months. insider Anthony Capuano only netted US$8.7k selling shares, in that period. It's not great to see insider selling, nor the lack of recent buyers. But the selling simply isn't sufficiently substantial to be of much use as a signal.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of McDonald'sFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. McDonald's insiders own 0.09% of the company, currently worth about US$191m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About McDonald's Insiders?We did not see any insider buying in the last three months, but we did see selling. But given the selling was modest, we're not worried. While we feel good about high insider ownership of McDonald's, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for McDonald's and we suggest you have a look.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

ROWE PRICE RELEASES RESEARCH STUDY ON ITS ACTIVE FUNDS,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-releases-research-183300708.html,1669660380,STORY,['TROW'],"[Analysis Demonstrates Historical Long-Term Performance Strength Compared to Passive and Active PeersBALTIMORE, Nov. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ-GS: TROW), a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement services, has released new research that shows over the last 20 years ended September 30, 2022, its actively managed funds have consistently outperformed passive peer funds – net of fees.Looking at rolling monthly 10-year periods, findings show T. Rowe Price funds beat comparable passive fund averages 73% of the time1, more often than the aggregate of all actively managed funds—excluding T. Rowe Price—comprising the Morningstar Direct database, which did so 47% of the time2. This also compares favorably to the five largest active management firms by assets under management in the mutual fund space, whose funds, when aggregated together, have outperformed the same passive averages 62% of the time3.The study focuses on the individual performance of 124 actively managed T. Rowe Price mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including equity, fixed income, and asset allocation funds, compared to average passive returns in the corresponding Morningstar category. Although T. Rowe Price funds are the focus, the calculation of passive averages allows comparison for more than 10,700 active funds to the passive averages representing 3,109 passive funds over 1,136,941 rolling one-year time periods. The T. Rowe Price funds reviewed represent 71% of the firm's mutual fund assets under management and 38% of the firm's total assets under management as of September 30, 2022. The equity category consisted of U.S. equity, international equity, and sector equity funds. The fixed income category included both U.S. and international bond funds.The full study methodology can be found here.T. Rowe Price fund performance was analyzed using two metrics: the frequency of outperformance, or active success rate, and the level of outperformance, or the average annualized excess returns over and above the determined passive average return. The passive average determining these metrics was calculated using the equally weighted average of the returns posted by the oldest share class of the passive funds in the Morningstar Direct category for each T. Rowe Price fund in the study.Story continuesRESULTSThe annualized excess returns above passive averages achieved by all T. Rowe Price equity funds across rolling 10‑year periods were, on average, 1.06% after fees and expenses. The active success rate for equity overall was 76%. When broken down by region and sector, average excess annualized returns were 0.78% for U.S. equity4, 0.64% for international equity5, and 2.59% for sector equity6. This trend of outperformance, after fees and expenses, also extended to the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods.T. Rowe Price fixed income funds also added value versus passive funds in comparable Morningstar Direct categories. Over 10-year rolling periods, the frequency with which T. Rowe Price fixed income funds outperformed was 59%, and the rate at which the funds exhibited less volatility than their passive peers was 75%. Volatility metrics for passive comparisons were calculated using the average standard deviation over the given period of the passive competitors in the category. The average annualized excess return, net of fees and expenses, was 0.17%. Fixed income funds averaged 0.49% less volatility, annualized, than comparable passive peers7.More than 90% of actively managed T. Rowe Price funds have an expense ratio below the average of comparable active funds in their Morningstar category8.Additional details on the T. Rowe Price equity fund analysis, including the funds' average annual total returns, can be found here and fixed income fund information can be found here.In a previous study of its target date mutual funds, T. Rowe Price found that its Retirement Funds series outperformed passive in 100% of rolling monthly 10-year periods since inception and had annualized excess returns of 1.39%9. That study can be found here.As another indication of its active management capabilities, T. Rowe Price was named by Refinitiv Lipper in March of this year as the 2022 Best Overall Large U.S. Fund Management Group. At the same time, it received 24 awards for individual fund performance from Lipper Refinitiv. More information is here.QUOTESEric Veiel, CFA, Head of Global Equity and Chief Investment Officer ""At T. Rowe Price, we strongly believe in the effectiveness of skilled active management. While passive funds have a place in some client portfolios, active management that is executed properly and consistently can deliver more attractive returns over the long term. Low expense ratios are important, but in the final analysis, nothing is more important than outperformance after fees and expenses. This study demonstrates our track record of delivering for clients. Our portfolio managers have deep experience—an average of 22 years in the industry and 17 years with T. Rowe Price—and leverage a vast platform of global research analysts. The collaboration and collective commitment of all our investment professionals to our clients is second to none. This long-term success is a function of their talent and the culture that has characterized the company for more than 85 years.""Andy McCormick, Head of Global Fixed Income and Chief Investment Officer ""We were pleased to see the study results reaffirm the benefits of active management in T. Rowe Price's fixed income offerings. The balance between generating active returns and mitigating downside volatility is a key focus of our portfolio construction and risk management disciplines. Our global research platform has enabled differentiation from passive fixed income offerings, which, for a variety of reasons, often struggle to mirror the bond indices they track and could make them more volatile than actively managed bond funds. Fixed income allocations continue to be an important source of income and diversification for our clients, and we remain committed to helping them meet their investment objectives.""Sébastien Page, CFA, Head of Global Multi-Asset and Chief Investment Officer""The success of T. Rowe Price's target date portfolios comes from multiple and diversified investment capabilities. Our goal in the multi-asset division is to deliver all of our firm's capabilities in one professionally managed solution. With strong, actively managed funds as a foundation, we believe that we can meaningfully enhance retirement outcomes for our clients through glide path design, strategic portfolio construction that delivers structural advantages and efficient diversification, and timely tactical asset allocation decisions. The study only reinforces this belief.""T.

All Active Managers represents the actively managed (non- ""index fund"") mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the Morningstar Direct database, excluding those managed by T. Rowe Price. The performance of the T. Rowe Price active funds and the All Active Managers funds were compared against the comparable passive funds using 10-year rolling monthly periods from 10/1/2002 to 9/30/2022. The analysis was conducted at the Morningstar category level analyzing all open-end funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) within U.S. Morningstar categories where passive funds are present. Oldest share class returns are used for analysis. Money market funds are excluded from the analysis.Target Date: The target date funds included in the combined portfolios were (1) defined as passive by Morningstar in its most recent annual Target‐Date Strategy Landscape report, (2) open and available to investors as of September 30, 2022, and (3) in the Morningstar universe sharing the same target date as each Retirement Fund. Combined portfolios were equally weighted and based on the oldest share class of each competing passive target date fund. The Retirement 2005 Fund was excluded from the study, as it had a limited number of passive peer constituents in the Morningstar universe; the Retirement 2060 and 2065 Funds were excluded due to lack of a 10‐year track record.The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even ifthe investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.1 80 funds covering 7,218 rolling 10-year periods.2 4,628 funds covering 346,577 rolling 10-year periods, excluding T.

Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.Recent times have been advantageous for United Parcel Service as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on United Parcel Service.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/E?United Parcel Service's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 73% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 124% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 1.2% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.0% per annum, which is noticeably more attractive.In light of this, it's curious that United Parcel Service's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are less bearish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On United Parcel Service's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Our examination of United Parcel Service's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support a more positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 2 warning signs for United Parcel Service (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than United Parcel Service.

The stock rose more than 1% in premarket trading.""It's easy to be neutral or negative on UPS in the current environment, but in our experience that's exactly the time to get more positive, especially under the stewardship of the current management team,"" Mehrotra wrote in a note to clients published Tuesday.He added: ""Recall, we downgraded UPS shares to hold this time last year, when we said that changing macro conditions and the upcoming labor contract negotiation were greater concerns to us in the context of a more than doubling of equity value since the start of the pandemic. While contrarian at the time, we believe those concerns are now fully reflected in shares and widely held by market participants.""Here are the details behind Deutsche Bank's upgrade:Rating: Buy (upgrade from hold)Price Target: $220 (up from $197)2023 EPS Estimate: $13.39 (10% above current analyst consensus)In the near-term, Mehrotra says investors should to shift their focus when looking at UPS' fundamentals.""We think market participants are overly focused on volume growth and not on mix and productivity initiatives, which we think can drive positive revenue growth and solid contribution margins despite modestly lower domestic volumes. Over the mid term, we think the upcoming teamsters contract negotiation will be more benign than expected, which partly reflects the signifiant cost of living adjustments (COLA) and market rate adjustments (MRAs) made to the current wage structure (UPS's strong results in the third quarter and second half 2022 estimate is despite $600 million of incremental union wage and benefit costs). We also see potential for negotiations to yield opportunity for UPS to gain additional market share via time in transit.""Snow falls at the United Parcel Service (UPS) WorldPort hub located at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., February 15, 2021. REUTERS/Bryan WoolstonMehrotra assigned a high grade to UPS CEO Carol Tomé for driving a better business, which should yield strong results over time.""We are also emboldened by impressive operating performance and potential for further productivity. It's no small feat, for example, to expand margins in a highly capital intensive business when volumes are down and costs are accelerating, which is what UPS did in the last three quarters. And, there appear to be numerous levers to allow consistent positive operating leverage. The company recently noted that just a ten minute improvement within its integrated network is worth $257 million to the bottom line (25 basis points of consolidated margin), which speaks to the opportunity afforded by the company's scale. We are also intrigued by the company's comments around attacking density challenges... which focus on temporarily holding orders at the first mile until better density can be achieved on the last mile (while still meeting customer service commitments). This can drive a 90% reduction in last mile unit costs (from $5.50 per package to 60 cents).""Story continuesBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

However, high operating costs, mainly due to elevated fuel expenses, are restricting bottom-line growth. Currently, UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Delving DeeperUPS’ strong free cash flow generating ability pleases us and supports its shareholder-friendly activities. In the first nine months of 2022, UPS generated a free cash flow of $8,472 million, paid out dividends worth $3.8 billion and repurchased shares of $2.2 billion. UPS aims to reward its shareholders with $8.2 billion in 2022 through dividends ($5.2 billion) and share buybacks ($3 billion).Even though demand for online shopping slowed down from the pandemic peak with the reopening of the economy, the figures are higher than the pre-pandemic levels. To meet the demand swell in the holiday season, UPS added more than 100,000 seasonal workers throughout the United States. Additional workers are needed to ensure a repeat of UPS’ buoyant performance witnessed last year with respect to timeliness. Therefore, the decision to hire extra hands to meet the anticipated surge in package delivery demand seems prudent. A strong performance during the holiday season is likely to boost the UPS stock.However, higher operating expenses are concerning. For example, operating costs escalated 9.7% in 2021. Due to the 66.4% jump in fuel expenses, operating costs increased 4.6% in the first nine months of 2022. Due to the persistence of high fuel costs, operating expenses are likely to soar in fourth-quarter 2022 as well.Rising capital expenses further add to its woes. UPS now expects current-year capital expenditures to be $5 billion, well above the 2021 levels. The increased capex guidance, albeit aimed at long-term benefits, may dent the current-year profit margins.In third-quarter 2022, shipping volumes dipped 2.1% year over year to 22.9 million. The contraction in the volume of packages shipped indicates weakening demand due to the economic slowdown. The metric had declined in the June quarter as well. This downside in shipping volumes due to softening demand is an added concern.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Transportation sector are as follows:Covenant Logistics CVLG: CVLG offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, including asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, besides asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability.The gradually improving freight market scenario is a tailwind to Covenant.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now. Digital money transactions are rising swiftly in emerging markets as innovations increase. Banks, fintechs, and telecom companies must rapidly create strategies to take up market share. Digital payment transactions have grown quickly in emerging markets in the last two years, and the COVID-19 pandemic helped the transition to digital payments and e-commerce. People leaned more towards e-wallets, online payments, direct bank transfers, and companies partnered with digital money providers to extend their customer base during the peak pandemic years. Africa and Southeast Asia saw the fastest acceleration in digital payments, as these regions have lesser banking access, which leaves higher potential to tap into underserved populations. Another significant development of the pandemic years has been the popularity of “buy now, pay later”, a type of short-term credit used by companies which enables consumers to divide payments into installments.On November 24, Rodney Bain, co-founder and US president of payments fintech Apexx Global, told Financial Times: “The pandemic had a profound effect on digital payments, driven by two key factors. The fundamental inability for consumers to make in-store transactions during lockdowns and general discomfort with exposure to physical environments; and the economical strain felt by consumers during the pandemic.” Some of the best digital payments stocks to invest in include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Our Methodology We selected the following digital money stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and future growth prospects. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. Story continues11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy NowPachai Leknettip/Shutterstock.comBest Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Now11. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is a Hong Kong-based company that operates an online brokerage and wealth management platform in Hong Kong and internationally. The company offers trading, clearing, settlement services, margin financing, securities lending services, and stock yield enhancement programs. On November 21, the company reported a Q3 GAAP EPADS of $0.68, beating market estimates by $0.07. The revenue of $247.9 million also outperformed Wall Street estimates by $19.75 million. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)’s total number of paying clients increased 23.8% year-over-year to 1,444,955 as of September 30, 2022.Investment advisory DBS Bank initiated coverage of Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) on October 24 with a Buy rating and a $55 price target.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 14 funds reported owning stakes worth $113.3 million in Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 9 funds in the prior quarter worth $153.2 million. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares valued at $49 million. Like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is one of the best  digital money stocks to invest in. Here is what Tao Value has to say about Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“Futu is a new “Opportunistic” position. It is an HK based online brokerage &amp; wealth management platform with deep roots in technology. Futu sits in the confluence of 3 strong favorable forces of Meteorology, Topography &amp; Commander, yet was underpriced at the time of our entry. In terms of Meteorology, there is a huge addressable market of Chinese domestic middle to upper classes’ wealth being deployed to overseas assets allocation in the next decade. Additionally, the incumbents being disrupted are extremely weak in their digital transformation. On Topography, Futu’s user-centric product design built an intuitive front end and great user experience, while the digital native development framework built a solid &amp; reliable back end (including a self-developed order routing &amp; execution system for the HK market). This is a rare combination compared to both offline incumbents (who lack flashy front end &amp; UX) &amp; other new online disrupters (who lack solid infrastructure). On Commander factor, founder CEO Li Hua was a Tencent engineer in its early days with deep knowledge in product design and development. Li is said to be a fanatic product manager, to this day still at the front-line, alpha testing any new features. Based on analyses of these factors, I think Futu could compound its revenue at a very high rate with very high certainty and with strong operating leverage, putting our entry price very attractive compared to earning power in 3-5 years. Yet just as we finished building a small position, the price started to take off and more than tripled in a month. When such price action happens, it is obvious that Mr. Market has turned very euphoric to this name. I decided to trim but kept a reasonable position given its growth certainty.”10. Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) is a Texas-based financial technology and bank holding company that provides financial products to consumers and businesses in the United States. It operates through three segments – Consumer Services, Business to Business Services, and Money Movement Services. It is one of the best digital money stocks to monitor. On November 9, Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 and a revenue of $337.2 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.09 and $7.19 million, respectively. The company sees year-over-year growth in revenue per account and positive trends in its GO2bank product. Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal on November 14 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $21 from $25 following the Q3 earnings.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 22 hedge funds were long Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT), compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP is the largest position holder in the company, with 5.3 million shares worth $100.5 million. Here is what Steel City Capital has to say about Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“The Partnership recently established new positions in Green Dot (GDOT). As for GDOT, the company is a collection of old-school money access/money movement operations as well as new-school “FinTech” offerings. It is perhaps best known as the banking partner behind Wal-Mart’s prepaid MoneyCard debit card. Prepaid debt is among the least sexy financial service offerings in the market and I also suspect there’s a degree of snobbery among the investing class that its primary customers sit on a lower socio-economic rung. I think these factors are contributing to today’s opportunity.One of the emerging trends in the “FinTech” space is integration of banking and payment services by consumer facing companies. The idea is that by integrating these services, companies can collect more data on spending patterns, drive a “stickier” customer relationship/brand loyalty, and ultimately drive more sales. At the same time, such consumer facing companies either can’t, or won’t, build out these platforms on their own. Doing so would require, among other things, 1) a specific degree of technological expertise and 2) ownership and control of a banking institution. The latter of the two factors – owning a banking charter – is a significant deterrent to “going it alone.” Owning a bank requires costly and time consuming compliance (AML/KYC, etc.) and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Over the years, a long list of household names with financial services ambitions (including Wal-Mart) have either tried and failed, or proactively decided against owning and operating a bank. This is where someone like GDOT comes in, supplying the technical know-how and offering use of their banking charter without the headaches of actually becoming a regulated bank. In industry parlance, this has come to be known as “Banking-as-a-Service” or BaaS, for short.GDOT’s relationship with Wal-Mart has shifted more in the direction of BaaS than “just” prepaid debit with WalMart last year converting all of their existing prepaid accounts to demand deposit accounts intended to function similarly to a traditional banking account. MoneyCard now comes complete with an app and various features like overdraft protection, early payday, and cashback on Wal-Mart purchases. Beyond Wal-Mart, GDOT has expanded its BaaS offerings with other large brands. Another interesting use case is its Partnership with Intuit’s QuickBooks. When you open a new QuickBooks business account, you’re given the option to open a QuickBooks branded business checking account at the same time, which is powered on the back-end by GDOT. There’s a lot of white space out there for GDOT to work with additional consumer facing companies to integrate payments and other banking services into their platforms. I’ll acknowledge that GDOT is far from the only “player” in the arena, but the mere fact that they’ve already bagged a number of large name clients on the BaaS side (Intuit/QuickBooks, Apple/Apple Cash, Uber/Uber Checking) at least suggests their capabilities and offerings have passed an intense amount of scrutiny…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) is a California-based company that provides a platform for digital and mobile-first commerce in the United States, Canada, and internationally. The company's platform includes point-of-sale payment solutions for consumers, merchant commerce solutions, and a consumer-focused app. Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM)’s revenue of $361.62 million grew 34.2% year-over-year, beating Wall Street estimates by $1.15 million.On November 10, DA Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler reiterated a Buy rating on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) but lowered the price target on the shares to $32 from $50 after its FQ1 results and updated guidance. The company reported a solid quarter against increasing macro headwinds and while the stock sold off, he is not worried as underlying trends suggest Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) continues to significantly outperform peers, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 26 hedge funds were bullish on Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 27 funds in the prior quarter. Colin Moran’s Abdiel Capital Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.16 million shares worth $40.7 million. Here is what Bireme Capital specifically said about Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “We recently covered our short position in Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) after a rapid decline brought the share price to ~$30 – down from our entry point above $100 – in only 7 months. We discussed Affirm in our Q4 letter, saying the following:Affirm is a “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) company founded by former PayPal CTO and cofounder Max Levchin. They provide installment loans to consumers, partnering with retail companies looking to drive higher sales. They have two primary products: a zero-fee installment loan for consumers with the best credit scores, and a more traditional product with 20%+ interest rates for subprime borrowers. Their stated plan is to disrupt the credit industry with more transparent, lower-fee loans. At a roughly $28b market cap at the start of 2022, AFRM stock was priced at more than 20x trailing sales, a steep price for a money-losing lender. While their early lead in online BNPL transactions and partnerships with fast-growing retailers like Peloton has fueled significant historical growth, a wave of competition has arrived… While the stock has already fallen sharply from where we initiated our short position, we think it could fall another ~40% to trade at 8x FY2022 sales.Interestingly, not much has changed about Affirm’s business from when it sported a $28b market cap. Estimates for 2022 sales have been inching up, from $1.25b at the start of the year to $1.35b today. And analysts estimate that the company will lose about $150m of EBITDA this year, slightly better than estimates in January. Rather than a story of deteriorating business fundamentals, this was a story of market participants simply deciding that a fast-growing, money-losing subprime lender – even a disruptive one – with around $1b of revenues should not be worth twenty-eight billion dollars. We think the current valuation is much more reasonable, and we do believe that Affirm will eventually generate profits from its lending platform, so we covered our short position.”8. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) is a Wisconsin-based company that provides payment and financial services technology worldwide. The company operates through Acceptance, Fintech, and Payments segments. It is one of the best digital money stocks to consider buying. Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) raised its full-year 2022 outlook and now expects organic revenue growth of 11% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.48 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% from its prior view of $6.45 to $6.55. The consensus adjusted EPS came in at $6.48. On October 28, Citi analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar maintained a Buy recommendation on Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $115 from $122 following the “mixed” third quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) was part of 59 hedge fund portfolios, with collective stakes worth approximately $4 billion. Harris Associates held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 21.3 million shares worth $2 billion. Artisan Partners made the following comment about Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“While our list of potential candidates is filling up, we are being patient. We added two new positions in Q3: Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) and Heineken. Fiserv is a provider of financial technology, core processing and payment processing services to financial institutions and merchants. The company reports three segments: acceptance (merchant acquiring), payments &amp; networks (issuer processing and debit network), and fintech (core bank processing). Fiserv has strong market positions and scale across these businesses, but competitive intensity varies. In the acceptance segment, Fiserv owns Clover, a high-growth point-of-sale (POS) system forsmall and medium businesses, with similar annualized gross payment volume to Block’s Square. However, Fiserv is receiving little credit for Clover. The market is overly concerned about the competitive nature of merchant acquiring and legacy processors losing market share to new entrants. We believe Fiserv’s business is more resilient and will continue to grow in the medium term driven by its scale and Clover. Moreover, fintech and payments are good businesses that are undervalued by the market. Both businesses are in highly consolidated industries where scale advantages are critical, and revenues are sticky due to high switching costs. A high share of recurring revenue and profit, an attractive margin profile and high free cash flow conversion are characteristics that should provide downside protection, in our view. We started our position with shares selling for about 11X normalized operating profit. That is a below-average multiple for an above-average business.”7. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a Florida-based company that provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide. It operates through Merchant Solutions, Banking Solutions, and Capital Market Solutions segments. On October 20, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) declared a $0.47 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 23, to shareholders of record on December 9. On November 25, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev maintained a Buy recommendation on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $90 from $105. The company's Q3 results were disappointing, but management's focus on cost-cutting can help improve sentiment, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 60 hedge funds were bullish on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter. Select Equity Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $443.5 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also sold out of payments and financial software maker Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), choosing to concentrate our digital payments exposure in PayPal (PYPL), which we believe has a more attractive risk/reward at these levels and more internal levers to generate returns. We bought FIS in 2019 for its mix of offense and defense with banking software and services as a stable business and payments that could keep up with fintech. The shares outperformed the benchmark up to the sale, illustrating the resiliency of the core business; however, FIS has underperformed higher-growth payment names.”6. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based company that provides charge and credit payment card products worldwide. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the leading digital money stocks to invest in. On November 21, UBS analyst Erika Najarian initiated coverage of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) with a Neutral rating and a $168 price target as part of a broader research note on U.S. Consumer &amp; Specialty Finance names. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 68 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $24.8 billion in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 67 funds in the prior quarter worth $25.2 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest position holder in the company, with 151.6 million shares valued at $20.45 billion. In addition to Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best digital money stocks favored by smart investors. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:45% = US$13b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.45 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 45% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Occidental Petroleum has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 32% which is quite remarkable. Despite this, Occidental Petroleum's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capitalStory continuesAs a next step, we compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and discovered that the industry saw an average growth of 6.8% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Occidental Petroleum is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Occidental Petroleum Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Occidental Petroleum's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 3.1%, (meaning the company retains97% of profits) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see higher growth than it has reported.Moreover, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 18% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 18%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Occidental Petroleum certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. In addition, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that the company's earnings are expected to continue to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The favorable findings were presented during a late-breaking clinical trial session at PCR London Valves 2022 and were published simultaneously in EuroIntervention.The ACURATE neo2 Aortic Valve System, which received the CE Mark in 2020, is being assessed in the currently enrolling ACURATE Investigational Device Exemption trial in the United States and Canada. However, the system is an investigational device and not available for sale in the United States.The latest positive PMCF study outcome of ACURATE neo2 Aortic Valve System in patients is a significant stepping stone for Boston Scientific’s Structural Heart Therapies business (under the broader Cardiovascular segment) across the world.Significance of the ResultPer Boston Scientific, the primary safety endpoint of all-cause mortality was very low at 30 days in this European study. The data also demonstrated that paravalvular leak (PVL) in patients were lower side.Per an expert associated with the PMCF study, the foundational data set now presents post-market surveillance results that validate the use of the current-generation ACURATE neo2 valve for the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis. The expert also added that the data suggest that the annular sealing technology of the current-generation ACURATE neo2 valve will likely minimize leakage around the valve, thus providing greater improvement in PVL than with the prior-generation ACURATE neo valve.The current-generation neo valve will also likely maintain single-digit permanent pacemaker rates, thereby leading to improved long-term patient outcomes.Per management, the trial data illustrate the success of meaningful and differentiated enhancements included in the design of the ACURATE neo2 valve, which includes low rates of PVL, excellent hemodynamic performance and high rates of procedural success and safety, among others.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Blueweave Consulting, the global structural heart devices market was worth $11.63 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $24.16 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 11.2%. Factors like the increase in the number of life-threatening heart diseases and technological advancements in medical devices are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest positive study outcome is likely to provide a significant boost to Boston Scientific’s business globally.Notable Developments in Cardiovascular ArmLast month, Boston Scientific announced its third-quarter 2022 results, where it registered better-than-expected revenues. The company also registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business amid several macroeconomic issues.The Cardiovascular segment also recorded robust revenue improvement, where sales from its sub-segments, Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions, were solid.In September, Boston Scientific announced results from the PROTECTED TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) clinical trial evaluating the SENTINEL Cerebral Protection System. The outcomes were presented during a late-breaking clinical science session at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics in Boston.Also in September, Boston Scientific received the FDA’s approval to expand the instructions for use labeling for the current-generation WATCHMAN FLX Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device to include a 45-day dual anti-platelet therapy option as an alternative to 45-day oral anticoagulation plus aspirin for post-procedural treatment of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 14.4% in the past year against the industry’s 43.8% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 15.1% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Boston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Despite this tailwind, the industry is being plagued by escalating fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions.Companies like Union Pacific Corporation UNP, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited CP, CSX Corporation CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC are expected to thrive on upbeat freight demand.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry consists of railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services. While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides owning locomotives, some of these companies have equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Railroad IndustryHealthy Freight Demand: Freight demand continues to be strong in 2022 as pandemic fears fade, despite softening from the 2021 levels due to a shift in consumer spending from goods to services. The Cass Freight Index rose 2.9% on a year-over-year basis in October. With steady freight demand, railroads are benefiting from higher volumes and pricing gains. The upbeat freight environment is expected to continue in the near term.Dividend Hikes Signal Financial Strength: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies are reactivating their shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. Earlier in 2022, both UNP &amp; CSX upped its dividend 10% and 7.5% to $1.30 per share and 10 cents per share, respectively.Story continuesSupply-Chain Disruptions a Woe: Persistent supply-chain disruptions, including labor and equipment shortages, are hurting railroad volumes in some segments, especially the carload and intermodal unit. Per The Association of American Railroads’ latest rail traffic data, the total U.S. carload and intermodal units declined 0.5% year over year in October 2022. Supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist for a while now, thus denting carload and intermodal volumes.High Fuel Costs Hurt Bottom Line: Operating expenses are on the rise, mainly due to increased fuel costs. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. High oil price (up 5.7% in the first nine months of 2022) is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains elevated.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93. This rank places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, implies encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate has been revised 1.1% upward since June-end.Given the bullish near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks that you may want to hold in your portfolio. But it’s worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and its current valuation first.Industry's Price PerformanceOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 6.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite’s fall of 15.1% and the broader sector’s decrease of 12%.One-Year Price PerformanceOne-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.41X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 5.61X. It is also above the sector’s P/B ratio of 4.27X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X as the chart below shows.Price-to-Book RatioPrice-to-Book RatioPrice-to-Book RatioPrice-to-Book Ratio4 Railroad Stocks to Keep Tabs onEach of the stocks mentioned below currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Segmentwise, freight revenues in the first nine months of 2022 increased 16%, 14% and 19% in the bulk, industrial and premium units, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNP’s 2022 earnings is pegged at 15.8% growth from the 2021 reported number.Price and Consensus: UNPPrice and Consensus: UNPCanadian Pacific: Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Canadian Pacific operates a transcontinental railway network in Canada and the United States.With the gradual recovery in freight-market conditions, freight revenues, contributing considerably to the top line, increased 4% in 2021. In third-quarter 2022, freight revenues increased 19% despite headwinds like supply-chain woes remaining.The increase was owing to higher freight revenues at key sub-groups like intermodal where freight revenues surged 44%. Revenues at the Fertilizers and sulphur sub-segment were up 11% year over year. In the September quarter, total freight revenues per revenue ton-miles (RTMs) rose 11% year over year. Total freight revenues per carload rose 7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CP’s 2022 revenues is pegged at 1.8% growth from the 2021 actuals.Price and Consensus: CPPrice and Consensus: CP       CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, and transport of intermodal containers and trailers besides rail-to-truck transfers.CSX’s top line is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, solid domestic intermodal shipments, volume growth in other segments and pricing gains. Evidently, coal revenues increased 36% in the first nine months of 2022, driven by strength in export coal. Intermodal revenues increased 19% in the first nine months of 2022, led by strong demand, mainly on the domestic front. Demand is likely to remain strong going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSX’s 2022 revenues stands at 22.4% growth from the year-ago reported figure.Price and Consensus: CSXPrice and Consensus: CSXNorfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern is a major freight railroad company, primarily engaged in transporting raw material, intermediate products and finished goods.A strong demand scenario prompted management to increase its current-year revenue growth outlook. Total revenues are now expected to increase above 13% in 2022 from the 2021 levels (earlier outlook: growth in excess of 12%). The intermodal and merchandise segments are expected to be the main drivers. Near-term opportunities are present in the coal segment too. Driven by revenue growth, reported the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is expected to be roughly 62% in 2022.

Moreover, dividend growth has never been below 2% on a 10-year annualized basis since 1950.According to Morgan Stanley, investors should focus on dividend companies offering consistent growth in their payouts.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

Blackstone is the largest alternative asset manager in the world with nearly $1 trillion of assets under management (AUM) and $700 billion of fee-earning capital. More importantly, 40% of Blackstone’s AUM is perpetual in nature and 90% of revenue is tied to capital that is perpetual or long term in nature. We have long admired Blackstone due to its strong brand, premier global franchise, loyal investor base, nearly 40-year superior investment track record, and talented executive team anchored by CEO Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray.The company has been at the forefront of new product innovation, and we believe that Blackstone will continue to be the winner against an appealing industry backdrop with durable growth characteristics, underpinned by: i) a large and growing addressable market in alternative investments of $10 trillion today vs. $250 trillion for stocks and bonds; ii) institutions continuing to allocate increasing amounts of capital to alternatives (due to historical lower volatility and higher returns); and iii) the opportunity in the retail/high net worth channel that is less than 5% penetrated (versus approximately 30% for institutions)…” (Click here to read the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest In10 Growth Stocks with Upside PotentialDisclosure.

(NASDAQ:INTU) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-institutional-ownership-intuit-inc-120317629.html,1669723397,STORY,['INTU'],"[If you want to know who really controls Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuit, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Intuit ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuit?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intuit. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Intuit's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Intuit. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.5% and 5.9% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of IntuitThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can see that insiders own shares in Intuit Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$3.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Intuit. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Intuit better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Intuit Mailchimp has partnered with National Football League (NFL) players across the country and GivingTuesday, a global generosity movement, to support the critical work of local organizations in six key U.S. markets: Atlanta, Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.This press release features multimedia.

""We aim to shine a light on these unsung heroes that are serving diverse populations and are already active within their local communities. When we all give where we live, we allow local nonprofits to carry on their important work year-round.""Story continuesAvailable immediately, Intuit Mailchimp published a local ""best kept secrets"" guide to help donors learn more about and give directly to vetted local nonprofits in their area. This year, Intuit Mailchimp and GivingTuesday are focused on drawing attention to nonprofits in six major U.S. markets that meet select criteria, including diversity of geography and population, and where active local nonprofits have taken a hit from the pandemic or other crises. To generate excitement and awareness for the campaign, Intuit will match their employees' donations made to Give Where You Live featured nonprofits at a 2 for 1 scale. Additionally, Intuit will give all full time employees $10.00 to donate to the campaign, or nonprofits in their own neighborhoods, allowing them to give where they live.""We’re honored to be a part of Intuit Mailchimp’s inaugural Give Where You Live campaign and the greater movement toward giving community driven nonprofits the chance to plant their flags, tell their stories, and connect with their community,"" said Bryan Schroeder, Executive Director of the Giving Kitchen, one of the Atlanta-based nonprofits featured by the Give Where You Live campaign. ""We hope more people will be inspired to make a donation to Giving Kitchen so we can reach food service workers in crisis in every community, and consider giving to their local nonprofits this GivingTuesday.""To kick off the movement, and as part of its partnership with the NFL, Intuit is partnering with current and former NFL players who are passionate about giving back to their local communities, including Atlanta’s Cordarrelle Patterson and Tyler Allgeier, Buffalo’s Stefon Diggs, Detroit’s Aidan Hutchinson, Los Angeles’s Austin Ekeler, and Philadelphia’s Brian Westbrook.""GivingTuesday's vision for the future is a world where generosity is a daily practice, and local nonprofits and changemakers in communities are key to that future. Email is an important tool for mobilizing good in the world, and Intuit Mailchimp's partnership helps us to better understand effective approaches to drive generosity,"" said Woodrow Rosenbaum, Chief Data Officer, GivingTuesday.As part of Give Where You Live and its year-round support of community-centric nonprofits, Intuit Mailchimp is partnering closely with GivingTuesday to publish data-driven insights meant to support nonprofits in fundraising, targeting their audiences through email campaigns, and more.To participate in the movement or explore local nonprofits near you, visit www.mailchimp.com/givewhereyoulive.About Intuit:Intuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities we serve.

This plant will convert pre-treated plastic waste into feedstock for new plastic production. On Oct 11, 2022, LYB announced that it signed an agreement with Germany-based 23 Oaks Investment to create a joint venture, Source One Plastics. The main focus of the joint venture will be to build and operate an energy-efficient plastic waste sorting and recycling facility in Germany. It will process the plastic packaging waste generated by 1.3 million German citizens per year that goes unrecycled, using renewable energy from wind and biomass. The processed waste will provide a material part of the feedstock to produce new plastic materials at LYB’s proposed advanced recycling plant at Wesseling. This plant further progresses LYB’s proprietary MoReTec technology, a high-yield technology used in converting plastic waste into pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gas. This, in turn, can be used as feedstock in LYB’s crackers to create new plastic products. LyondellBasell currently operates a semi-industrial scale MoReTec plant at its Ferrara, Italy, site. LYB announced that the Wesseling plant will be the first commercial-scale, single-train advanced recycling plant with scope for further scalability. With this plant, LyondellBasell can recycle most plastic materials like mixed plastic containers, multi-layered food packaging items, and more. The facility, with an estimated annual capacity of 50,000 tons, is scheduled to begin operations at the end of 2025. LYB is actively trying to develop and implement scalable, sustainable and circular technology. LyondellBasell aims to support its customers in meeting their demand for renewable as well as circular solutions, and this plant at the Wesseling site is an important step to that end. LyondellBasell is one of the leading plastics, chemical and refining companies. Based in Houston, TX, it operates in 18 countries. Currently, it is the world’s second-largest polypropylene producer. Multiple industries, such as packaging, electronics, construction materials and automotive parts, uses LYB’s products.Story continues In the last reported quarter, LYB delivered adjusted earnings of $1.96 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.96. Revenues fell 3.5% year over year to around $12.3 million in the reported quarter. LyondellBasell faced headwinds from higher-energy costs, new supply and softer markets in the quarter. Demand for its products used in consumer packaging remained stable. However, it saw weaker demand from durable goods markets. Olefins, polyolefins and intermediate chemicals markets witnessed significantly higher energy costs and soft demand in Europe in the reported quarter. LYB stated that its diverse business portfolio, strong balance sheet and solid liquidity are enabling it to navigate the challenging markets. Demand from consumer packaging, oxyfuels and refining markets remains strong. However, inflation, high-energy costs and softer seasonal demand are expected to further compress margins across most of LyondellBasell’s businesses in the fourth quarter. Challenging conditions are expected to persist in the European and Asian markets. For the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LyondellBasell’s revenues is pegged at $50.87 billion, indicating 10.2% growth from the year-ago reported figure. The same for earnings stands at $12.32 per share, implying a decline of 32.3% from the prior-year reported number. Price PerformanceShares of LyondellBasell have dipped 2.7% in the past year compared with a 1.5% decline of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderLyondellBasell currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include CalMaine Foods CALM, Alpha Metallurgical Resources AMR, and Olympic Steel ZEUS.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Gas Stocks To Buy Now. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the shortage of natural gas, further hiking up prices for consumers and businesses alike. This resulted in the use of alternative fuels and demand destruction. It also creates longer-term unpredictably in the natural gas market, especially in emerging nations where it used to play a primary role in energy transitions. According to the International Energy Agency, the Asia Pacific region and the industrial sector are the core drivers of growth in the natural gas market, accounting for 50% and 60% of the growth to 2025, respectively. However, the Asia Pacific region will be subject to high risk from rising prices and slow economic growth.As per IEA data, gas production in North America rose by 2.1% in 2021 although there was limited capital expenditure in the US upstream sector, driven by higher domestic and export demand. Per IEA’s estimates, North America holds a leading position in the intermediate-term in the global growth of natural gas supply, with nearly 85 bcm added between 2021 and 2025. The region represents nearly 40% of the net increase in production capacity and over half of the worldwide net production growth during 2021 and 2025. Some of the best gas stocks to invest in include ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC). Our Methodology We selected the following gas stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and solidity of dividend profiles.

We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”7. Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) is a Canadian integrated energy company focused on exploring, producing, and marketing crude oil, natural gas, byproducts, refined products, and power. On November 16, Suncor Energy Inc.

(NYSE:SU) was part of 45 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 47 in the earlier quarter. Paul Singer’s Elliott Management is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 10 million shares worth $281.6 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments International Growth ADR Strategy has to say about Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “Also within the structural bucket, we added to our commodity exposure with the purchase of Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU). Suncor, a past holding, is a Canadian integrated oil company where we capitalized on attractive valuation due to a COVID-19-induced slowdown. We expect recovery in oil demand and strong pricing will result in faster than expected free cash flow growth and financial deleveraging.The structural bucket has the shortest investment horizon across the spectrum of growth companies we target in the Strategy. We closely monitor the macro impacts and turnaround progress of these companies and will be disciplined sellers when the thesis for a holding plays out.”6.

Here is what he said:The US remains an oasis despite the chaos in the world. Americans are naturally optimistic, and our consumer-driven society so far has skirted a recession. However, the Fed is trying to re-establish its credibility by raising key interest rates and threatening to curtail existing economic growth. Engineering a ""soft landing"" has proven to be next to impossible in the past. I expect inflation to ""crack"" in September and decelerate to less than a 4% annual pace. The Fed has traditionally overshot when raising key interest rates, so it is imperative that after pricking the housing bubble that the Fed hits the ""pause button"" to ensure that the US economy does not slip into a recession. I will show investors my best recession-resistant stocks that I expect to prosper regardless of whether the US economy slips into a recession.Story continuesHaving purchased 42 new stocks, and sold out of 55 positions, Louis &amp; Navellier's most notable holdings in Q3 2022 include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”6.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned +9.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has gained 11.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $7.53 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +204.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.37 points to a change of +909.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.88 indicates a change of -26.4% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.13 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.77 billion and $144.28 billion estimates indicate +53.3% and -17.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $44.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +50.6%. EPS of $7.14 for the same period compares with $1.22 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.94%. The EPS surprise was +2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

REG is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of premium shopping centers in the affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas of the United States as these have strong growth drivers.This retail real estate investment trust (REIT) is focused on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers. As of the third-quarter end, its portfolio comprised 80% of grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven. This ensures dependable traffic and allows the company to bank on its grocery centers during uncertain times.REG’s portfolio has a good tenant mix, with several industry-leading grocers. This enables it to generate steady rental revenues.With more people moving into the suburbs due to the post-pandemic migration and the hybrid work setup, Regency’s suburban-shopping-center portfolio is expected to benefit.Regency’s expansion efforts into the key markets and development initiatives seem encouraging. From the beginning of 2022 through Sep 30, 2022, the company’s acquisitions totaled $201 million (at Regency’s share), encompassing 972,000 gross leasable area.On the balance-sheet front, the company had the full capacity under its $1.2-billion revolving credit facility as of Sep 30, 2022. Its low leverage and limited near-term maturities provide ample financial flexibility.Also, investment grade credit ratings of BBB+/Baa1 from S&amp;P Global and Moody's, respectively, render it favorable access to the debt market. With a strong financial footing, Regency is well-positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Analysts, too, seem bullish about the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share has moved marginally upward over the past week, indicating a favorable outlook for Regency.Shares of REG have gained 23.1% in the quarter-to-date period compared with the industry’s growth of 19.7%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Nonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is concerning for Regency. The efforts of online retailers to go deeper into the grocery business in recent years is likely to hurt the market share for brick-and-mortar stores, raising concerns for the company.Supply-chain challenges and labor shortages amid a high inflationary environment could adversely impact Regency’s development and redevelopment project pipeline.Also, rising interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT and American Assets Trust AAT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

303,bc9e9e3d-16cc-3cc5-a578-97bbf7c959e3,LKQ,2022-11-29,2 Auto Replacement Parts Stocks on the Right Track Amid Industry Odds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-auto-replacement-parts-stocks-132301827.html,1669641781,STORY,"['GPC', 'LKQ', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Automotive- Replacement Parts industry is reeling under chip crunch and supply chain disruptions, which are likely to limit sales. Additionally, increasing cost of raw materials, adverse foreign exchange translations and high research and development expenses are clipping margins. Seemingly, the only silver lining is the increasing longevity of vehicles. In an otherwise gloomy industry, Genuine Parts Company GPC and LKQ Corporation LKQ appear better-positioned, thanks to their strategic buyouts and investor-friendly moves.About the IndustryThe Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry comprises companies that engage in the production, marketing and distribution of replacement components for the automotive aftermarket. The industry players offer replacement systems, components, equipment and parts to repair as well as accessorize vehicles. A few of the important auto replacement components include engine, steering, drive axle, suspension, brakes and gearbox parts. The auto replacement market is somewhat less exposed to business downturns as consumers are more inclined to spend on replacement parts to maintain their vehicles rather than splurge on new ones. Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or can avail professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Key Themes Deciding the Industry's FateCommodity Inflation &amp; Forex Woes: Costs of raw materials like steel and non-ferrous metals are on the rise. Commodity inflation is not likely to abate anytime soon and will act as a major speed bump for quite some time. Industry players acknowledge that the increasing cost of raw materials is set to impact their margins. Further, most industry participants have a global presence, which makes them more vulnerable to forex woes. Adverse foreign currency translations are also likely to impact earnings and margins.Story continuesRising Operational Costs: The industry is bearing high costs for developing technologically advanced auto components amid the soaring popularity of electric vehicles, which is likely to weigh on profits further. With the technology shift in full swing, industry players must develop and upgrade their offerings to remain on par with the evolving trends in the automotive market. The new features and upgrades call for high capex and research and development expenses, which are likely to limit operating margins and cash flows.Supply Chain Snarls: The industry is battling semiconductor shortage— a byproduct of COVID-19 that only worsened with the Russia-Ukraine war. The deficit of microchips is hindering the business operations of the industry participants and the chip crunch is not likely to end anytime soon, in turn resulting in lost revenues. Logistical challenges and disruptions in the supply chain systems are clouding the prospects of the industry.Aging Vehicles: One comforting prospect of the industry is the increasing average age of vehicles. The average age of U.S. vehicles has hit a new record of 12.2 years. In a bid to ensure the long-term functioning of the aging vehicles, customers will more likely spend on repairs, thereby driving the business of auto replacement and repair companies. Also, amid economic uncertainty, customers are more likely to opt for repairing old vehicles rather than splurging on expensive new vehicles.Zacks Industry Rank Paints Gloomy PictureThe Zacks Automotive – Replacements Parts industry is a seven-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #185, which places it in the bottom 26% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since April, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have moved south by 3.5%.Despite the industry’s dim near-term outlook, we will present two stocks worth considering for your portfolio. But before that, let's look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry's Decline Narrower than S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Automotive – Replacement Parts industry has outpaced the Auto, Tires and Truck sector and Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has declined 1.3% against the sector and the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 45.8% and 15.1%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. Based on trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 9.27X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.21X and the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 13.43X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.08X, as low as 6.76X and at a median of 10.02X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)2 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnGenuine Parts: Atlanta-based Genuine Parts distributes auto and industrial replacement parts across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Indonesia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland. The KDG and Inneco acquisitions have bolstered the company’s Industrial segment. Other strategic bolt-on acquisitions, including Winparts, Rare Spares, PartsPoint and Alliance Automotive Group are adding to the top-line growth of the Automotive segment. GPC’s dividend aristocrat status boosts investors’ confidence. The company envisions 2022 free cash flow in the band of $1.2-$1.4 billion, calling for a surge from $992 million generated in 2021.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPC’s 2022 and 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 16% and 2.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2022 and 2023 earnings signals a year-over-year improvement of 18% and 6%, respectively. Genuine Parts— currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and having a Value Score of A—topped earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price and Consensus: GPCLKQ Corp: Headquartered in Illinois, LKQ is one of the leading providers of replacement parts, components and systems. The buyouts of Bumblebee Batteries, Elite Electronics, Green Bean Battery, SeaWide Marine Distribution, Greenlight and Fabtech Industries have bolstered the firm’s product offerings as well as sales. Low leverage and high liquidity of the firm increase its financial flexibility and lower default risk. As a show of its solid cash flow generation ability and balance sheet strength, the company recently hiked its dividend by 10% from the prior payout and boosted buyback by $1 billion. Between the period of initiating the stock buyback program in late October 2018 to Sep 30, 2022, LKQ repurchased around $2.2 billion worth of stock.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $4.18, implying 6.6% growth year over year.  The consensus mark for 2023 EPS has moved north by 2 cents a share to $4.18. The company surpassed earnings estimates in the last four quarters, the average surprise being 8%.

304,1d638f84-608c-3cdd-8bed-848ed6c0b252,ADP,2022-11-29,"Calculating The Fair Value Of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-automatic-data-130034406.html,1669726834,STORY,['ADP'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.39bUS$4.83bUS$5.15bUS$5.08bUS$5.37bUS$5.52bUS$5.65bUS$5.79bUS$5.92bUS$6.04bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.5%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.24%Est @ 2.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$118bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$118b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$59bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$96b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$258, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.017. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

306,db3449ee-cadc-36a7-95fb-5d2152b80ff8,PG,2022-11-29,"With 65% institutional ownership, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/65-institutional-ownership-procter-gamble-130048100.html,1669726848,STORY,['PG'],"[If you want to know who really controls The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Procter &amp; Gamble. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Procter &amp; Gamble?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Procter &amp; Gamble already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Procter &amp; Gamble's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Procter &amp; Gamble. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.8% and 4.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$237m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 35% stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Procter &amp; Gamble , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The current stock market situation has investors and hedge funds gravitating toward dividend stocks to increase their portfolios’ returns. Dividend payments also hit record levels this year as many companies reinstated or raised their payouts after being suffered by the pandemic of 2020. The net dividend gain for the 12 months ending September 2022 was $71.5 billion, compared with $61.4 billion during the same period last year, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The report also mentioned that cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 grew by 8.5% in Q3 2022 from the prior-year period.Analysts are also recommending income strategies in the current economic landscape. David Kostin, an equity strategist chief at Goldman Sachs, spoke about dividend stocks in the firm’s late October note. He highlighted the significance of dividend companies during times of weak economic growth. He mentioned that companies that returned cash to shareholders significantly outperformed the market during previous inflationary periods. The firm estimates a 6% growth in dividend per share over the next 10 years, compared with a 0.5% per share growth in dividends according to market pricing. Moreover, dividend growth has never been below 2% on a 10-year annualized basis since 1950.According to Morgan Stanley, investors should focus on dividend companies offering consistent growth in their payouts. These reliable securities are safe in times of economic clampdown as they have strong cash flows and solid balance sheets. The report also mentioned that banks, utility, beverages and household products, packaged food, and energy are some of the sectors that currently offer attractive yields and have strong dividend growth track records. Some of the popular dividend stocks that are gaining investors’ attention include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continues10 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds' holdings and picked the top 10 dividend stocks with over 5% yield.10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

Blackstone is the largest alternative asset manager in the world with nearly $1 trillion of assets under management (AUM) and $700 billion of fee-earning capital. More importantly, 40% of Blackstone’s AUM is perpetual in nature and 90% of revenue is tied to capital that is perpetual or long term in nature. We have long admired Blackstone due to its strong brand, premier global franchise, loyal investor base, nearly 40-year superior investment track record, and talented executive team anchored by CEO Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray.The company has been at the forefront of new product innovation, and we believe that Blackstone will continue to be the winner against an appealing industry backdrop with durable growth characteristics, underpinned by: i) a large and growing addressable market in alternative investments of $10 trillion today vs. $250 trillion for stocks and bonds; ii) institutions continuing to allocate increasing amounts of capital to alternatives (due to historical lower volatility and higher returns); and iii) the opportunity in the retail/high net worth channel that is less than 5% penetrated (versus approximately 30% for institutions)…” (Click here to read the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest In10 Growth Stocks with Upside PotentialDisclosure.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Eaton Corp. plc.

The company's bellwether status and optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.The firm has made more than 30 discoveries in offshore Guyana since 2015. ExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the prolific Permian Basin, where it expects to boost production volumes by 25% in 2022. The energy major has significantly lower debt exposure than composite players belonging to the industry. XOM recently reported strong third-quarter earnings owing to higher prices and production, and strong refining margins.However, the company has been constantly bearing the brunt of increasing expenses, adversely affecting the income. Also, the aggressive capital budget remains a headwind for the company. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Exxom Mobil here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Meta Platforms have been laggards this year, with the market unhappy with management's spending plans on the metaverse given the uncertain pay off from the project over the near to medium term. On top of the metaverse spending issue is the weak outlook for digital ad spending in the current uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Unfavorable forex, targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple's iOS changes, normalization of e-commerce after the pandemic peak and higher inflation hurt growth in the reported quarter.User base in Europe declined in the reported quarter. Meta's fourth-quarter guidance reflects macroeconomic and forex concerns. Weak advertising demand is a headwind. Meta expects Reels to monetize much slower than feed or stories.Story continuesHowever, Meta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific.

The company's global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, cyber-attacks and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations.However, Eaton's third-quarter earnings per share were better than expected. ETN's research and development investments allowed it to develop products for providing efficient power management solutions to customers.The spin-off of non-core businesses and acquisitions will allow Eaton to further expand operations.

We'll use ROE to examine The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sherwin-Williams is:75% = US$1.9b ÷ US$2.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.75 in profit.Does Sherwin-Williams Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Sherwin-Williams has a better ROE than the average (18%) in the Chemicals industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Sherwin-Williams' Debt And Its 75% Return On EquityIt seems that Sherwin-Williams uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 4.06. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Sherwin-Williams may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Codenamed project “Highland,” Tesla is aiming to cut production costs for the Model 3 and increase the appeal of the sedan by revamping the car's exterior, powertrain, and interior components, such as its massive center-console display. Tesla would reduce costs by reducing complexity overall.BRUSSELS, BELGIUM - JANUARY 09: Tesla Model 3 compact sedan car in white on display at Brussels Expo on January 9, 2020 in Brussels, Belgium. The Model 3 is fitted with a full self-driving system. (Photo by Sjoerd van der Wal/Getty Images)Though the Model 3 has been periodically updated with under-the-skin enhancements to mechanical components and battery materials, this would be the first major revamp of the car, if it does go through. Premium Tesla models like the Model S and Model Y have been revamped with exterior styling, new touchscreen tablets, and yoke steering wheels.Per Reuters, the redesigned Model 3 would go into production in Q3 2023 first at Tesla’s Giga Shanghai factory, then eventually at its main U.S. plant in Fremont, CA.Tesla Semi conducts crucial testWith all eyes on Tesla’s biggest EV, the Tesla Semi, this week at its first delivery event at Giga Nevada, CEO Elon Musk confirmed the truck hit a big milestone.In a tweet, Tesla Musk said the Semi completed a 500-mile drive with a full payload of 81,000 lbs.The Tesla Semi is an all-electric Class 8 commercial tractor trailer, and the federally-allowed limit for Class 8 trucks is 80,000 total pounds of gross vehicle weight.The Tesla Semi is on display at the Tesla Giga Texas manufacturing facility during the ""Cyber Rodeo"" grand opening party on April 7, 2022 in Austin, Texas. - Tesla welcomed throngs of electric car lovers to Texas on April 7 for a huge party inaugurating a ""gigafactory"" the size of 100 professional soccer fields. (Photo by SUZANNE CORDEIRO / AFP) (Photo by SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images)Based on Musk’s tweet, it is assumed that the Tesla Semi completed this 500-mile drive on one full charge, but this could not be confirmed. It is also not clear how much of the 81,000 lbs consisted of the Semi itself and its battery weight.Nonetheless, it is a milestone for the Tesla Semi, which also debuted in 2017, and was supposed to go into production in 2019 but has subsequently suffered numerous delays.Story continuesTesla will unveil the production version of the Semi at a delivery event this Thursday from Giga Nevada. Pepsi, Tesla’s first customer, confirmed with Yahoo Finance that its executives will be at the event. Media and the general public are not allowed at the event, though it will be streamed on Tesla’s YouTube channel.Tesla full-self driving goes wideA Tesla Model 3 vehicle drives on autopilot along the 405 highway in Westminster, California, U.S., March 16, 2022. REUTERS/Mike BlakeIn a tweet late last week, Musk confirmed that Tesla’s full-self driving (FSD) beta software has been made available to anyone in North America.The option for the FSD beta system is only available for those that purchased the option, currently costing $15,000.FSD is an enhanced version of Tesla’s “autopilot” driver assistance system, which brings features like automated steering on non-highway roads, traffic light and signage recognition, parking assist and vehicle “summoning” from tight spaces.The rollout of FSD beta comes at a time of increased scrutiny from the federal government.

Despite this tailwind, the industry is being plagued by escalating fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions.Companies like Union Pacific Corporation UNP, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited CP, CSX Corporation CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC are expected to thrive on upbeat freight demand.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry consists of railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services. While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides owning locomotives, some of these companies have equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Railroad IndustryHealthy Freight Demand: Freight demand continues to be strong in 2022 as pandemic fears fade, despite softening from the 2021 levels due to a shift in consumer spending from goods to services. The Cass Freight Index rose 2.9% on a year-over-year basis in October. With steady freight demand, railroads are benefiting from higher volumes and pricing gains. The upbeat freight environment is expected to continue in the near term.Dividend Hikes Signal Financial Strength: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies are reactivating their shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. Earlier in 2022, both UNP &amp; CSX upped its dividend 10% and 7.5% to $1.30 per share and 10 cents per share, respectively.Story continuesSupply-Chain Disruptions a Woe: Persistent supply-chain disruptions, including labor and equipment shortages, are hurting railroad volumes in some segments, especially the carload and intermodal unit. Per The Association of American Railroads’ latest rail traffic data, the total U.S. carload and intermodal units declined 0.5% year over year in October 2022. Supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist for a while now, thus denting carload and intermodal volumes.High Fuel Costs Hurt Bottom Line: Operating expenses are on the rise, mainly due to increased fuel costs. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. High oil price (up 5.7% in the first nine months of 2022) is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains elevated.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93. This rank places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, implies encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate has been revised 1.1% upward since June-end.Given the bullish near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks that you may want to hold in your portfolio. But it’s worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and its current valuation first.Industry's Price PerformanceOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 6.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite’s fall of 15.1% and the broader sector’s decrease of 12%.One-Year Price PerformanceOne-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.41X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 5.61X. It is also above the sector’s P/B ratio of 4.27X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X as the chart below shows.Price-to-Book RatioPrice-to-Book RatioPrice-to-Book RatioPrice-to-Book Ratio4 Railroad Stocks to Keep Tabs onEach of the stocks mentioned below currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Union Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States.With economic activities gaining pace, freight revenues, accounting for the bulk of UNP's top line, are improving. In the first nine months of 2022, freight revenues improved 16% year over year. Segmentwise, freight revenues in the first nine months of 2022 increased 16%, 14% and 19% in the bulk, industrial and premium units, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNP’s 2022 earnings is pegged at 15.8% growth from the 2021 reported number.Price and Consensus: UNPPrice and Consensus: UNPCanadian Pacific: Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Canadian Pacific operates a transcontinental railway network in Canada and the United States.With the gradual recovery in freight-market conditions, freight revenues, contributing considerably to the top line, increased 4% in 2021. In third-quarter 2022, freight revenues increased 19% despite headwinds like supply-chain woes remaining.The increase was owing to higher freight revenues at key sub-groups like intermodal where freight revenues surged 44%. Revenues at the Fertilizers and sulphur sub-segment were up 11% year over year. In the September quarter, total freight revenues per revenue ton-miles (RTMs) rose 11% year over year. Total freight revenues per carload rose 7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CP’s 2022 revenues is pegged at 1.8% growth from the 2021 actuals.Price and Consensus: CPPrice and Consensus: CP       CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, and transport of intermodal containers and trailers besides rail-to-truck transfers.CSX’s top line is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, solid domestic intermodal shipments, volume growth in other segments and pricing gains. Evidently, coal revenues increased 36% in the first nine months of 2022, driven by strength in export coal. Intermodal revenues increased 19% in the first nine months of 2022, led by strong demand, mainly on the domestic front. Demand is likely to remain strong going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSX’s 2022 revenues stands at 22.4% growth from the year-ago reported figure.Price and Consensus: CSXPrice and Consensus: CSXNorfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern is a major freight railroad company, primarily engaged in transporting raw material, intermediate products and finished goods.A strong demand scenario prompted management to increase its current-year revenue growth outlook. Total revenues are now expected to increase above 13% in 2022 from the 2021 levels (earlier outlook: growth in excess of 12%). The intermodal and merchandise segments are expected to be the main drivers. Near-term opportunities are present in the coal segment too. Driven by revenue growth, reported the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is expected to be roughly 62% in 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NSC’s 2022 earnings stands at 13.6% growth from the year-ago reading.Price and Consensus: NSCPrice and Consensus: NSCWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

319,42532835-6330-3c2f-95c2-428aaacec42a,AMP,2022-11-29,Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) Is Up 1.13% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-services-amp-1-170005118.html,1669654805,STORY,['AMP'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ameriprise Financial Services currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if AMP is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this financial services company holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor AMP, shares are up 1.13% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry is up 1.05% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.48% compares favorably with the industry's 4.79% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Ameriprise Financial Services have risen 23.84%, and are up 13.94% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -3.72% and -12.95%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to AMP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. AMP is currently averaging 590,083 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with AMP.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AMP's consensus estimate, increasing from $23.96 to $24.56 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that AMP is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Ameriprise Financial Services on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

320,74b54304-31b7-3653-a0b0-c05cdc3c94b1,AMP,2022-11-29,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights BlackRock, Ameriprise Financial, Affiliated Managers Group and Prospect Capital",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-blackrock-125012609.html,1669639812,STORY,"['AMP', 'BLK', 'AMG', 'PSEC', 'SPGI']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 28, 2022 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses BlackRock, Inc. BLK, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. AMP, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. AMG and Prospect Capital Corp. PSEC.Industry: Investment ManagementLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2022173/4-investment-management-stocks-to-watch-in-a-prospering-industryHigher interest rates will benefit the Zacks Investment Management industry stocks, which bore the brunt of low rates during the pandemic. While elevated technology costs might hurt profitability, investment managers' margins will no longer be under pressure given the rate hikes. This should aid revenue growth.Moreover, investment managers have benefited from higher volatility and client activity amid the pandemic. Although markets normalized in second-half 2021, client activity has gained momentum once again. Hence, BlackRock, Inc., Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. and Prospect Capital Corp. should benefit from growth in assets under management (AUM).About the IndustryThe Zacks Investment Management industry consists of companies that manage securities and funds for clients to meet specified investment goals. They earn by charging service fees or commissions. Investment managers are also called asset managers, as they manage hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity, venture capital and other financial investments for third parties.By appointing an investment manager for one's assets, investors get more diversification options than they would have if they managed their assets by themselves. Investment managers invest their clients' assets in different asset classes, depending on their needs and risk-taking abilities. Hence, the diversification, which investors get by appointing asset managers to manage their assets, helps reduce the impact of volatility and ensures steady returns over time.3 Investment Management Industry Trends to ConsiderInterest Rate Hikes to Aid Margin Growth Despite Shift in Preferences: Similar to the past few years, demand for passive investing has been on the rise on the continued need for low-cost investment strategies. Thus, rising demand for passive investments is expected to negatively impact investment managers' margin growth to some extent. Nevertheless, the interest rate hikes since the beginning of this year to tame the raging inflation will likely result in an improvement in margins in the near term. Also, the rise in industry consolidation witnessed since the beginning of 2020 is likely to support bottom-line growth.Story continuesGrowth in AUM Likely to Continue Despite a Volatile Trend in Asset Flows: In 2020 and the first half of 2021, there was a significant rise in equity market volatility and solid client activity, owing to the coronavirus-induced uncertainty, which aided total AUM growth. In the second half of 2021, markets began to normalize, with client activity remaining decent. Nevertheless, the first nine months of 2022 again witnessed an unexpected rise in volatility and relatively higher client activity, resulting in asset inflows for the majority of the industry players.Thus, despite a volatile trend in flows (seen recently), growth in AUM is expected to continue in the near term. Asset managers' top lines are, therefore, expected to improve, supported by higher performance fees and investment advisory fees, which constitute the majority of their revenues.Elevated Costs Remain Concerning: The tightening of regulations to increase transparency has led to a rise in compliance costs for investment managers. Also, as wealth managers are constantly trying to upgrade technology to keep up with evolving customer needs, technology costs are expected to keep rising. These will likely lead to an increase in overall expenses, thus, hurting investment managers' bottom line.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Investment Management industry is a 44-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #89, which places it at the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of bright earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have just started gaining confidence in this group's bottom-line growth potential. The industry's current-year earnings estimates have been revised 1.3% higher since the end of October 2022.Thus, we present a few stocks from the prospering industry that you may want to keep an eye on. But before that, let's check out the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Investment Management industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and its sector in the past two years.Stocks in the industry have collectively lost 2.4%. The S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 9.6% and the Zacks Finance Sector has appreciated 12.2%.Industry's Current ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TB), which is commonly used for valuing finance companies because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TB of 3.90X. This compares with the highest level of 5.27X, the lowest level of 2.04X and the median of 3.59X over the past five years. Additionally, the industry is trading at a significant discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TB for the S&amp;P 500 composite is 10.30X, which the chart below shows.As finance stocks typically have a low P/TB ratio, comparing investment managers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group's P/TB ratio with that of its broader sector seems more meaningful. When we compare the group's P/TB ratio with the broader Finance sector, it seems that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector's trailing 12-month P/TB of 4.69X for the same period is above the Zacks Investment Management industry's ratio.4 Investment Management Stocks to Keep an Eye OnBlackRock: The New York, NY-based Zacks Ranked #3 (Hold) company is the largest asset manager by assets in the United States, with a market capitalization of $110.6 billion. The company's diversified products, revenue mix and inorganic expansion efforts have been aiding AUM growth. As of Sep 30, 2022, BlackRock had total AUM worth $7.96 trillion.The company's AUM has witnessed a seven-year (2015-2021) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6%. While its AUM balance declined in the first nine months of 2022 due to the tough operating backdrop amid the macroeconomic concerns, the trend will likely reverse in the future.The company has been continuously strengthening its iShares and exchange-traded funds (ETF) operations. Its efforts to gain market share in the active equity business will likely keep aiding profitability.Supported by a solid balance sheet and liquidity position, BlackRock has expanded via acquisitions, both domestic and overseas. In June 2021, it acquired the Climate Change Scenario Model of Baringa Partners. In February 2021, it completed the acquisition of investment management services provider, Aperio Group. Apart from these, over the years, the company has acquired several firms across the globe, thus, expanding its footprint and market share.Moreover, in August 2022, BlackRock partnered with cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global, to provide its institutional clients with access to digital currencies. Through the partnership, BlackRock's institutional clients will have access to crypto trading, custody, prime brokerage, and reporting via Coinbase Prime, which is the exchange's institutional platform, providing a wide range of features and tools.In the past three months, shares of BlackRock have gained 8.8%. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2022 earnings has been revised marginally upward to $33.88 per share, whereas its 2023 earnings estimates have witnessed a downward revision of 1% to $34.08.Ameriprise: Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, Ameriprise has a market cap of $35.4 billion. Since 2005-end, the company has been operating independently of American Express Company. As of Sep 30, 2022, it owned, managed and administered assets worth $1.1 trillion.Ameriprise operates a well-diversified portfolio compared with its industry peers. It constantly modifies its product and service-offering capacity to keep pace with dynamic market needs. This strategy, along with asset growth, has helped the company witness a rise in total net revenues.Moreover, AMP has grown inorganically and restructured its business from time to time to remain profitable by focusing on its core operations. In November 2021, the company acquired BMO Financial Group's EMEA asset management operations, which will bolster its wealth and asset management businesses and global diversification efforts. In July 2021, it closed a deal for RiverSource Life Insurance Company (its insurance subsidiary) with Global Atlantic's subsidiary, Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company, to reinsure $7 billion of fixed deferred and immediate annuity policies.In 2019, it divested the Ameriprise Auto &amp; Home business. These initiatives, along with a few others, are expected to continue supporting revenue growth. Notably, AMP maintains long-term issuer ratings of A- from S&amp;P Global and Fitch, and A3 from Moody's Investors Service, with a rating outlook of stable from all three agencies. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.AMP's shares have gained 21% over the past three months. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2022 earnings has been revised upward by 3% to $24.56 per share.

The affiliates manage more than 500 investment products across each major product category — global, international and emerging markets equities, domestic equities, and alternative and fixed-income products. The company has a market cap of $5.9 billion.As of Sep 30, 2022, this Zacks Ranked #3 company had total AUM of $644.6 billion. AMG is expected to continue generating meaningful growth through new investments. Its successful partnerships and focus on strengthening the retail market operations will likely keep aiding profits.Affiliated Managers has been targeting investments in alternatives and global strategies, given the strong investor preference for the same. The acquisitions of the majority stakes in Parnassus Investments and Abacus Capital Group, along with the buyouts of minority stakes in OCP Asia, Boston Common Asset Management and Systematica, are steps in this direction.While Affiliated Managers' affiliates have been witnessing overall net outflows over the past few years, the company's differentiated product categories are likely to support cash flows across channels.AMG has appreciated 20.1% over the past three months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2022 earnings has been revised upward by 7.5% to $19.53 per share over the past 30 days. Likewise, earnings estimates for 2023 have been revised upward by 5.2% to $19.48.Prospect Capital: Headquartered in New York, NY, PSEC has a market cap of $3.1 billion. The company is a leading provider of private debt and private equity to middle-market companies in the United States, with a focus on sponsor-backed transactions and direct lending to established owner-operated companies. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.PSEC invests primarily in first-lien and second-lien senior loans and mezzanine debt, which in some cases include an equity component.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the European mall industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Malls in Europe.Market OutlookThe European retail industry is valued at $3.6 trillion as of 2021 according to Statista. There are roughly 10,000 malls in Europe as of 2021, with the United Kingdom taking the biggest share with over 1,500 malls, per their report. The European mall industry’s economic outlook is not very different from those of other regions when it comes to the mall's traditional purpose. Malls in general are declining in popularity, owing to factors like E-Commerce. The online sales already make up 15% of total shopping in most of Europe. The average retail growth is around 4% while online sales grow by an average of a far higher 20%. In fact, the pandemic lockdowns accelerated the E-Commerce growth to 43% in 2020, adding massive amount of value to stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).Moreover, the persistent inflation around the world and the central banks' rate hikes in response have put the mall industry on a slippery slope, as consumers cut back on spending. This has led European REITs to start adapting to a changing shopping landscape. An Adapting IndustryOne of the ways the industry is adapting is extended diversification, with European malls adding more and more experience and service-based incentives, like museums, art galleries, government offices and theme parks etc.  Florencio Beccar, the fund manager of CBRE Global Investors' European Shopping Center Fund, was quoted by NBC News at the purchase of a German mall that came with a medical facility. He said that purchasing malls with services like medical facilities and others is a major advantage to offset decline in physical retail.In addition to that, many REITs are moving towards logistics, which is another way the European mall industry is trying to adapt and survive. According to CBRE research, every $1 billion addition in online sales requires an additional space of 1.3 million square feet in warehouses, raising the demand for fulfillment centers. Story continuesInsofar as Europe is concerned, a Prologis report showed that every additional 1 billion euros in online sales resulted in an average increase in warehouse demand of almost 72,000 square meters in Britain, Germany, and France, during the studied period of 2007-2012. Logistics also has a cost advantage. Retail space costs around $20 per square foot while the same for logistics costs only $6.5. Its yield is also two percentage points higher on average than retail. This has resulted in malls across the world in general and malls in Europe in particular, attempting to transition and rezone the spare retail spaces in their buildings for the logistics business.Simon Hope, the global head of capital markets for the UK-based property consultant Savills, confirmed the trend with NBC News, saying, “logistics is the new retail.”Key PlayersThere are thousands of malls in Europe but some of the most prominent names in the industry are Mega Belaya Dacha in Russia, Westfield Centro in Germany, Bluewater in the UK and Istanbul Cevahir in Turkey. As far as mall-owning REITs are concerned, Klépierre SA (OTCMKTS:KLPEF) is the biggest mall owner in Europe. It owns 155 malls across 16 European countries.Now that we know the state of the mall industry in Europe, let’s move on to the 11 biggest malls in Europe. 11 Biggest Malls in EuropePixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor our list of the 11 biggest malls in Europe, we’d be ranking them based on their total area.

""In our view, this means these retailers’ assortments likely resonated with consumers &amp; allowed these banners to drive relatively more profitable Black Friday revenue.""As for the losing retailers, the analysts added that they were handed weak store traffic at a time of increased discounting, which may ultimately lay the foundation for poor fourth-quarter profits.By and large, retailers are off to a so-so beginning to the holidays as consumers balk at inflationary prices for merchandise and spend more on experiences such as dining out and travel.U.S. retail sales on Black Friday were up 12% year-over-year excluding automotive, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse data. That was below Mastercard's projection of 15% growth.Adobe, which tracks online purchases, said Black Friday weekend spending rose 4.4% from the prior year to $9.5 billion. For the holiday season to date (Nov. 1 to Nov. 27), consumers have spent $96.42 billion online, up only 2.1% year over year.Angelica Rippee, 23, of Buena Park, waits with other shoppers to get into the Lululemon store to enjoy exclusive Black Friday deals at the Citadel Outlets on Thursday, Nov. 24, 2022, in Commerce, CA. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)""The holiday weekend data points from industry sources seemed in-line to positive overall with online growth outperforming store performance,"" Citi retail analyst Steven Zaccone noted, echoing the mixed data out of Adobe and Mastercard. ""Our specific field work showed in-store traffic was a bit underwhelming as most store associates spoke to traffic down year over year.""Story continuesZaccone called out increased promotional intensity at Best Buy (BBY), leading him to reiterate a Sell rating with a $72 price target on the stock.""Consumers were more targeted with their store visits vs. casual browsing and likely prioritized online shopping for bargain hunting,"" Zaccone added on the retail sector more broadly.

323,9dbebaff-6dbb-39fb-a3e2-54d5e4df4edf,CSCO,2022-11-29,What Veterans Day Means to Cisco's VETS Inclusive Community,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veterans-day-means-ciscos-vets-131000947.html,1669727400,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 29, 2022 / Every November 11th, you may see more flags flying and people thanking military veterans for their service. Veterans Day is a federal holiday that honors military veterans of the United States Armed Forces every year on November 11th, which marks the end of World War I on November 11, 1918. It is a day to celebrate veterans for their willingness to serve, for the sacrifices they and their families make, and for their love of their country and the people they protect.Cisco Systems Inc., Tuesday, November 29, 2022, Press release pictureCisco is committed to building an inclusive future for all, including supporting our veteran employees and their families. Cisco's Employee Resource Organizations are now known as Inclusive Communities, and we have one for veterans called Global Veterans Enablement Troop Support (VETS).The mission of VETS is to provide resources, mentoring, career guidance, and support to Cisco's veteran community. We strive to raise awareness within Cisco of veterans' contributions and skills as prospective employees and assist transitioning service members as they trade their uniforms for corporate attire. Finally, VETS actively engages the local community to support our deployed servicemen and women with care package campaigns, calling card drives, and outreach programs to nearby military installations.Learn more from members of VETS about what Veterans Day means to them.Gary BantadCustomer Project ManagerGary Bantad has been with Cisco for 4 years and is currently working as a Customer Project Manager for US CX Centers, RTP. Gary served in the U.S. Army for over 20 years, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel. He served the first 7 years as a PATRIOT Air Defense Artillery Officer, and the remainder as a Civil Affairs Officer. He lives with his family in Cary, North Carolina.""For many people, Veterans Day means thanking a veteran for their service - for those who have served, and those currently serving the nation. I have always been surprised and humbled when people say, ‘Thank you for your service,' but I often wonder if they really know what that means to a veteran, especially for someone like me.Story continuesMy time in the Army was during the period before and after 9/11 - known as the Global War on Terrorism era. This meant many, many weeks away from family, to train in remote places before going on multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Initially, the deployments were one year - so I missed birthdays, our anniversary, my kids' entire academic school year and sports events, family events like weddings, and every single U.S. holiday. During some of those deployments, teammates were injured or killed. Later, deployments were cut down to under nine months, but I still faced the same hardships.This is hard to describe in words, but the absolute best feeling in the world is flying back home from a long deployment and reuniting with your family. You are in tears but ecstatic at the same time. Also, I cannot explain it, but ‘coming home' always rekindled my love of the United States. So, on Veterans Day, if you thank a veteran, please think of the sacrifice and hardships they endured in service to the nation. I bet they will be surprised, humbled…and appreciate it!""Kristina MaybinAppDynamics Field Marketing ManagerKristina Maybin has been with Cisco for 4.5 Years and is currently an AppDynamics Field Marketing Manager. Before joining corporate America, she served in the US Army for 11 years and reached the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 2 (CW2). The highlight was Her last assignment as IT Advisor to the 101st Airborne Division Commander. She lives in the Atlanta Metro Area.""I come from a family of veterans with my father, brother and sister all serving. Veterans Day is special to me because it is a day when the entire country stops and acknowledges those that have served. I appreciate being acknowledged for my contribution and service and enjoy seeing the outpouring to all veterans.This is an occasion for veterans to come together to support and celebrate each other. I'm inspired by the resilience of the veteran community.It has become common to say, ‘Thank you for your service.' I think Veterans Day is the perfect day to take a moment to really appreciate the sacrifices service members and their families have made.""Welton ChaseDirector, Customer ExperienceWelton Chase has been with Cisco for nearly three years and is currently Director, Customer Experience. He served 31 years in the US Army as a signalman (Signal Corps Officer) and then a General Officer.""I have been around veterans my entire life. As a young child growing up in Kansas, I remember the veterans who formed my community in a small town where the soldiers of the First Infantry Division were preparing to go to Vietnam. Many would never come home and as young children we watched those casualty notification teams come much too frequently during the heavy fighting in 1967 and 1968. Those veterans came home to a country that did not fully appreciate their service or sacrifice.Those who survived the war did what the nation asked and then reintegrated into ‘normal' life. My memories of these veterans will always remind me of what it means to do your duty, make great sacrifices, have courage, and to serve something greater than self. Those attributes shaped the communities I lived in and would inspire me to join the military. Thirty-one years later my time in the Army reaffirmed how truly special our country is to have Americans willing to put on the cloth of the nation, go into harm's way, and serve something greater than themselves. I was honored to serve among them and like those who I watched as a young child, got to see how their service and sacrifice make our country truly better.To all our veterans - thank you!""Akeeya UmsteadIntegration Program ManagerAkeeya Umstead has been with Cisco for about 3 years and is currently an Integration Program Manager on the Corporate Development Integration team in the Finance Organization. She currently resides in the RTP Area. Her father, Wallace Umstead, served in the US Army from 1968-1971 and currently resides in Alamance County, North Carolina.""Veterans day is celebrated every year with a lunch date with my dad. He was drafted to serve in the Vietnam War and was sent to Germany as a medic. He was honorably discharged, then went on to develop a career in the medical field where he worked for over 20 years.He didn't have a choice in service but there are many people that sacrifice and choose to be of service to our great nation.Many years after service, I was fortunate enough to get my dad care through the Veteran Affairs (VA) health system. Walking into the VA hospital with my dad and hearing veterans talk about their war stories is very special.Every day the VA plays Taps, and we were attending a Veteran Amputee event. For the first time I saw my dad rise to attention with no help, and he took his hat off and placed it over his heart and I watched the other vets do the same. At that moment it was like they all went back to a time when they were either on base or in the field and had to salute or stand at attention for the playing of the bugle call.In that moment I then had a deeper understanding of why everyone stops a vet or active military and says, ""thanks for your service."" It's because we have certain freedoms that our military fights for on our behalf. So, I will continue to celebrate Veteran's Day every year!""How to honor veterans all yearWhen veterans return to civilian life, there is a lot they need to adjust to, including finding employment. That is why Cisco led the creation of programs designed to help veterans and their spouses develop new skills for a career in tech, and to pursue roles directly at Cisco and our partners.Beyond thanking veterans for their service, here are a few steps you can take on your own to show your support to friends, family, colleagues, and members of your community who have served:Learn more about the lived experiences of veterans through books, podcasts, or documentaries.Look for organizations that serve veterans and their families and consider donating or volunteering.Don't just show your support during Veterans Day.

INFN and RADCOM RDCM.Industry: Computer - NetworkingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2021242/3-stocks-to-watch-for-in-a-flourishing-networking-industryIncreasing focus on cloud computing, network security, big data and cloud storage is expected to boost the performance of the Zacks Computer - Networking industry participants. Accelerated deployment of 5G is driving the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices and 5G smartphones, calling for solid networking infrastructure.This boosted the demand for networking products, favoring the prospects of prominent industry players like Cisco, Infinera Corp. and RADCOM. However, negative impacts stemming from the lingering supply chain disruptions and component shortages are likely to remain a concern in the near term. Geopolitical instability in Europe due to the Ukraine war, weak global economic conditions and rising inflation and crude prices are likely to act as additional headwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer - Networking industry comprises companies that offer networking and Internet-connected products, including wireless (WiFi and Long-Term Evolution or LTE), Ethernet and powerline, with a focus on dependability and ease of use. The products are available in numerous configurations to cater to changing requirements of consumers in each geographic territory where it operates for smooth network connectivity and broadband access.Some industry players also provide mission-critical IoT solutions and network security services to help clients build next-generation connected products and implement and manage critical communications infrastructures in demanding environments with enhanced levels of safety. Focus on developing IoT sensors, drones and wearables amid increasing demand for cloud computing-based contact tracing applications is driving the industry.Story continues4 Trends Influencing the Computer- Networking Industry FutureRapid Deployment of 5G to Boost Growth Prospects: Continuation in work from home and the adoption of a hybrid/flexible work model have triggered demand for network-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. This is anticipated to accelerate 5G deployment through 2022 and beyond. The impending 5G boom will likely propel the industry to newer heights.The success of 5G technology hinges on substantial investments to upgrade infrastructure in the core fiber backhaul network to support growth in data services. More efforts to develop smart connected homes, hospitals, factories, buildings and cities and self-driving vehicles bode well for the industry players. The industry players are investing heavily in LTE, broadband and fiber to provide additional capacity and improve Internet and wireless networks. These initiatives hold promise.The Uptick in Wi-Fi 6 Networking to Drive Momentum: Brisk technological advancement, dynamic products, high-speed connectivity, low latency and evolving industry standards define the Computer Networking industry. The growing clout of the latest Wi-Fi 6-compliant residential gateways, Wi-Fi routers, set-top boxes and wireless range extenders is a testament to the same. Wi-Fi 6 — the latest 802.11ax wireless standard — is estimated to offer 30% faster network speed over 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5). This is anticipated to bolster the industry participants' top line.Innovation in Networking Technologies is Opening New Business Avenues: Growing clout of Smart Home and Internet-connected products such as Smart TVs, game consoles, High Definition (HD) streaming players, security cameras, thermostats and smoke detectors continue to drive innovations in networking. The rapid proliferation of IoT, the increasing popularity of smart connected devices and the growing adoption of cloud computing in network security are fueling the demand for an efficient network support infrastructure.The advancements in AI and ML and the high adoption of cloud applications hold immense potential for companies in the industry. Enterprises are striving to manage fixed and wireless devices in a secured infrastructure. To address the demand, industry firms are driving innovation in networking technologies, including network virtualization and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which favors growth prospects.Relative Slowdown in IT Spending A Concern in the Near Term: Per a Gartner report, worldwide IT spending is expected to increase 0.8% in 2022 compared with 2021 levels and reach around $4.4 billion. The geopolitical disruptions, inflationary pressures and protracted pandemic-induced supply chain troubles are a major concern.
