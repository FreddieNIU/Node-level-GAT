HYMLF electric vehicles (EV).onsemi’s Elite SiC power modules will help the two sister companies’ EVs to provide performance such as speed acceleration from zero to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds and reaching a top speed of 161 mph.on recently announced that EliteSiC is the new name of its SiC family of solutions, and it would launch three solutions — the 1700 V EliteSiC MOSFET and two 1700 V avalanche-rated EliteSiC Schottky diodes — at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.ON has forayed into building its SiC modules to capitalize on the uptrend in the market for energy infrastructure, factory automation and EVs.The company generates a significant percentage of revenues from each of the computing, consumer, industrial, communications and automotive markets. onsemi reported revenues of $2.19 billion in the third quarter of 2022, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6% and improved 26% on a year-over-year basis.The company is reallocating capacity to strategic and high-margin products to drive a favorable mix shift and eliminate price-to-value discrepancies. onsemi is expanding its production capacity in strategic locations and closing fab locations in areas affecting its margin growth due to rising price surges in operating in those areas.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Expands SiC Production Capacity to Boost GrowthThe entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to a number of macroeconomic turmoils like raging inflation, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, forex market volatility and the looming recession. These can negatively impact the performance capabilities and bottom-line growth of companies like onsemi, which has a significant debt burden.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, 2022, onsemi had a cash balance of $2.45 billion, whereas total debt (including the current portion) was $3.21 billion. A high debt position increases the risk profile of the business. Thus, the company is required to constantly generate an adequate amount of cash flows to meet debt requirements.However, despite its leveraged balance sheet, onsemi has been expanding its SiC facilities domestically and internationally to diversify its product portfolio. Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, witnessing a CAGR of 33%.onsemi currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company recently expanded its Hudson, NH-based facility, which will increase SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year. This will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure, and is an important contributor to decarbonization.ON recently expanded its SiC facility in Roznov, Czech Republic, to expand SiC production capacity by 16 times. So far, ON has invested more than $150 million in the Roznov site and will look to spend an additional $300 million through 2023.onsemi recently completed the sale of its Niigata, Japan facility, which aligns with its fab liter strategy to expand the gross margin and reduce its fixed-cost footprint.Also, positively impacting the domestic expansion of onsemi’s SiC facilities is President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act. The act supports investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduces dependence on foreign markets like China and Japan. Its peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The government's recent declaration will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances. Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON faces stiff competition from Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are chief competitors of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will help EV makers achieve faster charging and reduce EV weight, helping STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicles and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.onsemi, however, signed long-term supply agreements with various customers for the next three years, which are expected to help secure $1 billion of committed SiC revenues in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 3.2% loss over the past four weeks.The increase in share price can be attributed to recommencement of merger talks by Western Digital and Japan-based Kioxia Holdings as per a report by Bloomberg.Citing sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg added that the companies are mulling integrating into one publicly traded company. While discussions currently are highly fluid and the talks could end without any agreement, added Bloomberg.

This company, which is in the Zacks Building Products - Lighting industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This lighting maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 18.02%.For the most recent quarter, Acuity Brands was expected to post earnings of $3.35 per share, but it reported $3.95 per share instead, representing a surprise of 17.91%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.98 per share, while it actually produced $3.52 per share, a surprise of 18.12%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Acuity Brands, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Acuity Brands has an Earnings ESP of +7.71% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 9, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

10,6673c6ce-d2f7-3dc3-b4c0-92057dadfee0,USB,2023-01-06,5 S&P 500 Banks With Solid Dividend Yield Amid Recession Risk,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-p-500-banks-solid-133001799.html,1672925401,STORY,"['TFC', 'CFG', 'USB-PQ', 'TFC-PR', 'HBAN', 'C']","[The banking industry seems well-capitalized to gain from a higher interest rate regime. The minutes from the last FOMC meeting underscored the central bank’s resolve to keep the interest rates high till inflation numbers cool down reasonably. The Federal Reserve officials noted that they would be required to maintain a “restrictive policy stance” until data gave proper indications of inflation pressures easing.Thus, banks are expected to keep benefiting from higher rates. The Fed raised the rates to a 15-year high range of 4.25-4.50% since March 2022. This immensely supported banks’ net interest income (NII) and resulted in an expansion of net interest margin (NIM). But as the rates remain higher, loan demand is expected to gradually falter. Also, due to this ultra-hawkish monetary policy stance, the U.S. economy is likely to slow down considerably and may even face a “mild” recession in the near term.Hence, investors must be cautious while picking bank stocks. Given such a grim scenario, decent dividend-paying stocks should be on investor radar. So, we picked five banks – Citigroup C, Truist Financial TFC, U.S. Bancorp USB, Huntington Bancshares HBAN and Citizens Financial Group CFG – that are part of the S&amp;P 500 Index and have been regularly paying dividends.To choose these banks, we ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to find stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 4% and a five-year historical dividend growth of more than 5%. Also, these stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s now discuss the above-mentioned five bank stocks in detail:Headquartered in New York, Citigroup is a globally diversified financial services holding company providing a range of financial products and services. The company, which is among the top four U.S. banks, has around 200 million customer accounts across 160 countries and jurisdictions.A diverse business model, focus on core operations and streamlining of international consumer businesses will continue to drive the company’s growth. C continues to optimize its branch network, with a focus on core urban markets and improving digital channels. It is also making efforts to simplify operations and reduce costs. All these initiatives will likely help augment its profitability and efficiency over the long term.The stock has a dividend yield of 4.34% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 9.04%.

Headquartered in Charlotte, NC, the company offers a variety of services to consumers and commercial clients through 2,119 banking offices and 3,185 automated telling machines (ATMs).Steady loan growth, higher interest rates and Truist Financial’s efforts to improve fee income will likely keep aiding financials. The company has been undertaking strategic acquisitions to further its support fee income growth. Over the past couple of years, it acquired BankDirect Capital Finance, BenefitMall, Kensington Vanguard National Land Services and Constellation Affiliated Partners to bolster the insurance business. Given its ample liquidity, TFC is less likely to default on interest and debt repayments, even if the economic situation worsens.The company has a dividend yield of 4.64% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 7.64%.

With the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank in December 2022, the company fortified its presence in California, Washington and Oregon and bolstered its status as the fifth-largest retail bank in the United States. Further, U.S. Bancorp is undertaking a number of opportunistic buyouts, which have strengthened its fee income sources. These have also enhanced U.S. Bancorp’s range of products, services and capabilities as well as improved market share.The company has a dividend yield of 4.17% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 9.4%.

Citizens Financial’s focus on executing a series of revenue and efficiency initiatives led to the introduction of “Tapping Our Potential” (TOP) program in late 2014. It remains on track to realize substantial benefits through the TOP 7 Program this year. The bank is well poised to grow via acquisitions, reflected in its accomplishment of several major buyouts in the last several years.

QuoteConclusionAs the macroeconomic conditions are turning dismal, investors become interested in dividends for a number of reasons. These greatly improve stock investing profits, lower overall portfolio risk and carry tax advantages, among others. But investors must be careful as choosing stocks just based on higher yields is not a good idea. They must also take into account company fundamentals to find compelling investment opportunities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Target, like many others, failed to adapt to quickly changing consumer shopping patterns that caused it to suffer a rough 2022, full of inventory issues, lagging sales, and more.Target’s earnings outlook has continued to plummet for FY22, FY23, and FY24, with TGT shares tumbling alongside its fading EPS estimates. Although Target’s long-term outlook like remains intact, now might not be the best time to dive back into TGT, especially with the U.S. economy in the midst of a downturn.Not Pandemic Shoppers AnymoreInvestors first hammered Target stock after its Q1 FY22 earnings release for TGT’s inability to navigate rising freight costs and more. Alongside its bottom-line miss, Wall Street also hated Target’s initial decision to absorb higher costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Walmart WMT got hit hard for a similar report at the time.  Target got stuck dealing with inventory issues because the firm simply had too much of the wrong stuff on hand. Consumers spent well over a year buying all of the furniture, appliances, TVs, and other big-ticket items that they needed.Target was forced to discount items and take other measures to offload its access inventory. Fast forward to TGT’s third quarter release in November, and Wall Street got more bad news. TGT lowered its guidance once again as consumers continued to pull back on spending.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTarget is continuing to offer discounts in an effort to attract shoppers to discretionary items. “We know they are spending more dollars on food and beverage and household essentials, and as they are shopping for discretionary categories they are looking for promotions,” CEO Brian Cornell said on TGT’s Q3 earnings call.The inflationary crunch on shoppers is hitting Target harder than rival Walmart because TGT’s business is made up more heavily of these discretionary items that people have cut out of their budgets.Story continuesTGT’s consensus earnings estimate for FY22 is down 32% since its Q3 release alone and way more since the start of 2022. Plus, its outlook for fiscal 2023 is now 21% lower, with FY24 trending heavily in the wrong direction as well.Bottom LineTarget’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. And Zacks estimates call for its adjusted earnings to fall 59% YoY in fiscal 2022 and then come in well below its FY21 levels in fiscal 2023. And its most recent EPS estimates are coming in beneath the current consensus.Target has also missed our adjusted earnings estimates by an average of 33% in the trailing three quarters. TGT is the Bear of the Day given its near-term outlook and the continued unknowns ahead on the consumer spending and inflation fronts.Target does remain a possible long-term play given its overall standing and strength within a key segment of the consumer-driven U.S. economy. And Target stock is down about 40% from its highs. But TGT just surged off oversold RSI levels a few weeks ago and some investors might want to wait for a slightly better entry point.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, in the near term, the company's balance sheet is unfavorable in the current environment, including the high debt leverage and the elevated inventory balance.WWW's bank-defined leverage ratio is 3.4x, with net debt of $1.35 billion and liquidity of $400 million, which is the highest across the analyst's coverage.The analyst is optimistic about the corporate strategy review but specified that these initiatives would take time, especially in the current uncertain consumer environment.Piper Sandler analyst Edward Yruma downgraded Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) from Overweight to Neutral and lowered the price target from $26 to $20.The analyst noted that Nordstrom continues to struggle with execution, and tailwinds from W.O.T. (work, going ""out"", travel) framework should diminish in 2023.The analyst noted that the company's sales performance was respectable relative to peers, driven in part by a return to office, travel, and supportive higher-income spending trends.While the premium brands/retailers proved to be much more resilient in 2022, the analyst believes that some of these spending tailwinds may decrease in 2023, given the prospect of higher unemployment and continued pressure in asset markets.Nordstrom just extended its semi-annual sale this year to Jan 9 vs. Jan 2 last year, and the promotions are likely to remain high within full-line in the near term.The company's valuation looks fair, but the analyst thinks earnings risk remains on the downside.Price Action: WWW shares are trading lower by 6.10% at $10.85, and JWN shares are down 0.24% at $16.58 on the last check Thursday.Story continuesLatest Ratings for WWWDateFirmActionFromToMar 2022UBSMaintainsNeutralFeb 2022Telsey Advisory GroupMaintainsMarket PerformFeb 2022Telsey Advisory GroupMaintainsMarket PerformView More Analyst Ratings for WWWView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaCoinbase Analyst Sees Clouded Path Forward — Downgrades Stock As Trading Volumes Are FallingLooking Into Daktronics's Recent Short InterestDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

ITT is poised to gain from strength in the end markets like chemical and industrial pumps, commercial aerospace and defense, rail and general industrial despite supply-chain constraints, high cost of sales (due to raw material cost inflation) and increasing operating expenses. The company’s organic orders grew 7% year over year in the third quarter, driven by strong demand for pumps, connectors, aerospace and defense components. Also, a robust backlog in its businesses, supported by the recovery in the energy end market, is expected to boost its performance in the long run.ITT has been investing in product innovation across its connectors, friction technologies and pump businesses for some time now. ITT also launched the third generation of its i-ALERT Condition Monitoring Solution in May 2022. Also, its connector business unveiled its ruggedized, modular circular series Veam MOVE-MOD in November 2021. The company intends to become more competent on the back of innovation investments in the quarters ahead.ITT acquired Clippard Instrument Laboratories’ product lines in August 2022. The buyout expanded its Compact Automation product offering in the robotics, packaging and automation end markets. The acquisition of CRP Technology and CRP USA (jointly CRP) in June 2022 helped ITT acquire additive manufacturing technology capabilities and strengthened its position in the material science space. Also, the buyout of Habonim (April 2022) boosted ITT’s offerings in the cryogenic and hydrogen ball valve space apart from expanding into new end markets. It predicts the buyout to be accretive to its EBITDA margin.In the first nine months of 2022, ITT paid out dividends of $66.1 million and bought back shares worth $245.6 million. Also, the quarterly dividend rate was hiked 20% in February 2022.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should hold on to the ITT stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The minutes from the last FOMC meeting underscored the central bank’s resolve to keep the interest rates high till inflation numbers cool down reasonably. The Federal Reserve officials noted that they would be required to maintain a “restrictive policy stance” until data gave proper indications of inflation pressures easing.Thus, banks are expected to keep benefiting from higher rates. The Fed raised the rates to a 15-year high range of 4.25-4.50% since March 2022. This immensely supported banks’ net interest income (NII) and resulted in an expansion of net interest margin (NIM). But as the rates remain higher, loan demand is expected to gradually falter. Also, due to this ultra-hawkish monetary policy stance, the U.S. economy is likely to slow down considerably and may even face a “mild” recession in the near term.Hence, investors must be cautious while picking bank stocks. Given such a grim scenario, decent dividend-paying stocks should be on investor radar. So, we picked five banks – Citigroup C, Truist Financial TFC, U.S. Bancorp USB, Huntington Bancshares HBAN and Citizens Financial Group CFG – that are part of the S&amp;P 500 Index and have been regularly paying dividends.To choose these banks, we ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to find stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 4% and a five-year historical dividend growth of more than 5%. Also, these stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s now discuss the above-mentioned five bank stocks in detail:Headquartered in New York, Citigroup is a globally diversified financial services holding company providing a range of financial products and services.

The company has been undertaking strategic acquisitions to further its support fee income growth.

QuoteConclusionAs the macroeconomic conditions are turning dismal, investors become interested in dividends for a number of reasons. These greatly improve stock investing profits, lower overall portfolio risk and carry tax advantages, among others. But investors must be careful as choosing stocks just based on higher yields is not a good idea. They must also take into account company fundamentals to find compelling investment opportunities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

HYMLF electric vehicles (EV).onsemi’s Elite SiC power modules will help the two sister companies’ EVs to provide performance such as speed acceleration from zero to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds and reaching a top speed of 161 mph.on recently announced that EliteSiC is the new name of its SiC family of solutions, and it would launch three solutions — the 1700 V EliteSiC MOSFET and two 1700 V avalanche-rated EliteSiC Schottky diodes — at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.ON has forayed into building its SiC modules to capitalize on the uptrend in the market for energy infrastructure, factory automation and EVs.The company generates a significant percentage of revenues from each of the computing, consumer, industrial, communications and automotive markets. onsemi reported revenues of $2.19 billion in the third quarter of 2022, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6% and improved 26% on a year-over-year basis.The company is reallocating capacity to strategic and high-margin products to drive a favorable mix shift and eliminate price-to-value discrepancies. onsemi is expanding its production capacity in strategic locations and closing fab locations in areas affecting its margin growth due to rising price surges in operating in those areas.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Expands SiC Production Capacity to Boost GrowthThe entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to a number of macroeconomic turmoils like raging inflation, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, forex market volatility and the looming recession. These can negatively impact the performance capabilities and bottom-line growth of companies like onsemi, which has a significant debt burden.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, 2022, onsemi had a cash balance of $2.45 billion, whereas total debt (including the current portion) was $3.21 billion. A high debt position increases the risk profile of the business. Thus, the company is required to constantly generate an adequate amount of cash flows to meet debt requirements.However, despite its leveraged balance sheet, onsemi has been expanding its SiC facilities domestically and internationally to diversify its product portfolio. Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, witnessing a CAGR of 33%.onsemi currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company recently expanded its Hudson, NH-based facility, which will increase SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year. This will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure, and is an important contributor to decarbonization.ON recently expanded its SiC facility in Roznov, Czech Republic, to expand SiC production capacity by 16 times. So far, ON has invested more than $150 million in the Roznov site and will look to spend an additional $300 million through 2023.onsemi recently completed the sale of its Niigata, Japan facility, which aligns with its fab liter strategy to expand the gross margin and reduce its fixed-cost footprint.Also, positively impacting the domestic expansion of onsemi’s SiC facilities is President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act. The act supports investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduces dependence on foreign markets like China and Japan. Its peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The government's recent declaration will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances. Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON faces stiff competition from Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are chief competitors of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will help EV makers achieve faster charging and reduce EV weight, helping STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicles and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.onsemi, however, signed long-term supply agreements with various customers for the next three years, which are expected to help secure $1 billion of committed SiC revenues in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Both benchmarks had gained about 13% during the prior three weeks.""The oil market might be regaining some composure following the bloodbath earlier this week, but the upside potential remains limited, at least in the near term. The economic outlook is clouded,"" PVM analyst Stephen Brennock said.U.S. services industry activity in November contracted for the first time in more than 2-1/2 years, according to a report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).But another report showed the U.S. economy added jobs at a solid clip in December, pushing the unemployment rate back to a pre-pandemic low of 3.5% as the labor market remains tight.That U.S. jobs report caused the U.S. dollar to fall and global stocks to rally as investors bet that inflation is easing and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) need not be as aggressive as some feared.A weaker dollar can boost demand for oil, as dollar-denominated commodities become cheaper for holders of other currencies.Atlanta Federal Reserve (Fed) President Raphael Bostic said the latest U.S. jobs figures are another sign that the economy is gradually slowing and should that continue the Fed can step down to a quarter percentage point interest rate hike at its next policy meeting.The world's top crude exporter, Saudi Arabia, lowered prices for the Arab light crude it sells to Asia to its lowest since November 2021 amid the global pressures hitting oil.Stock markets in China, the world's largest crude oil importer, logged a five-day winning streak on Friday on investors' expectations that the Chinese economy would soon emerge from its COVID woes and stage a robust recovery in 2023.Story continuesBut, more countries around the world are demanding visitors from China take COVID tests, days before China drops border controls and ushers in an eagerly awaited return to travel for a population that has been largely stuck at home for three years.Euro zone inflation tumbled last month but underlying price pressures are still rising and economic growth indicators are surprisingly benign, suggesting that the European Central Bank will keep raising interest rates for months to come.India's government expects economic growth to slow in the financial year ending March, as pandemic-related distortions ease and pent-up demand for goods levels out going into 2023.(Reporting by Rowena Edwards in London, Emily Chow in Singapore and Scott DiSavino in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Mark Porter and David Gregorio)]"

But the vault is home to other priceless treasures — and secretsYou may be aware of Fort Knox from the James Bond movie Goldfinger, or from the old cartoon where Bugs Bunny tricks Yosemite Sam into digging up some of the gold bars and getting arrested.But what do you really know about the U.S. bullion bunker in Kentucky?The Fort Knox gold vault is one of the most secure and secret places in America. Because few people have ever gotten inside, the gold depository is a subject of fascination and speculation.Here are 10 things we know — and maybe don't know.Don't missBetter than NFTs: You don't have to be ultra-rich to own a piece of a Pablo Picasso. Here's how to enter the fine art market'It was tough, scary times': Baby boomer financial experts who survived The Great Inflation recount ways to ride out a recessionYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)1. It holds tons of gold — literallyFort Knox currently houses 147.3 million ounces of gold. The government says the bullion has a ""book value"" of $6.22 billion.However, that's based on a fixed price that officials set in 1973. Based on the current market value of gold, the reserves at Fort Knox are worth a far more impressive $273.7 billion, roughly speaking.Much of the gold in the vault is in the form of 27-pound bars, while a percentage is in gold coins.At one time, the point of having all of that gold was to provide backing for U.S. currency — but the dollar was taken off the gold standard in 1971.2. Is the gold really in there?So why does the U.S. hang onto its gold stash?""Just in case we need it,"" is the explanation a former Federal Reserve Board chairman reportedly gave.Conspiracy theorists have insisted that the government secretly sold off the gold and that the gold bars are actually tungsten bricks painted to look like the precious metal.There's no way for outsiders to say with absolute certainty if there's really bullion — or if it's all bull. Over the years, there have been few audits to test the gold, or inventories to count it.Story continues3. Outsiders rarely get insideIn 2017, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin led a rare visit by outsiders to peek at the gold reserves inside the Fort Knox vault.He was accompanied by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the two of them were photographed holding gold bars.Afterward, Mnuchin had an answer for the conspiracy mongers. ""Glad gold is safe!"" he tweeted.The last time Fort Knox had opened its vault to civilians was more than 40 years earlier.During her tenure as Director of the U.S. Mint, Mary Brooks led a tour of the vault for members of Congress and the news media in 1974. U.S Treasury Secretary William E. Simon allowed the visit in an effort to quell rumors that all the gold had been removed from the vaults.4. Only one U.S. president ever got insidePresident Franklin Roosevelt commissioned the construction of Fort Knox in the mid-1930s, reportedly because the Treasury worried that U.S. gold reserves weren't safe from an enemy invasion.Later, Roosevelt became the only U.S. president ever to set foot inside the gold vault’s titanic walls.He traveled to Fort Knox to make an inspection in 1943, about seven years after construction on the vault was completed.5. It's one beefy buildingFort Knox contains 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 750 tons of reinforced steel and 670 tons of structural steel. The cost of construction in the 1930s was a mere $560,000.Read more: The best investing apps of 2023 for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)The roof is said to be bomb-proof, and the main vault door weighs 20 tons and is 21 inches thick. The Treasury says no one person knows the entire combination.The door is resistant to torches, drills and explosives — not that any of that matters. The real challenge to any would-be intruder is reaching the building in the first place.6. Guards and more guardsFort Knox is guarded by members of the U.S. Mint Police, one of the oldest federal law enforcement agencies. It was established in 1792.The officers undergo 12 weeks of basic training, followed by five weeks of field training. They learn a long list of heavy-duty skills, including weapons handling, cornering, door entry and room clearing.If that doesn't seem intimidating enough, Fort Knox sits at the center of a 109,000-acre U.S. Army post and is a training ground for military troops from around the country.7. A frail foreign visitorOccasionally, the vault at Fort Knox has held other precious items, besides gold.In 1939, one of the original copies of the Magna Carta — the Medieval English charter laying down basic human rights — was brought to the U.S. to go on exhibit at the New York World's Fair.When World War II erupted, the delicate document was transferred to Fort Knox for safekeeping. The Magna Carta stayed in residence until 1947, when it went back to England.But for a time, it had some treasured American roommates.8. Very special guests from US historyWorld War II turned Fort Knox into a hotel of sorts for prized papers from both sides of the pond.Originals of the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights and the U.S. Constitution were moved to the gold vault out of fear that the nation’s capital would be attacked.As the war wound down, the parchment was returned to its rightful home in Washington, D.C., in 1944. That left some room at Fort Knox for the next priceless guest.9. Protection for a hallowed headpieceLegend has it that Hungary's King Coloman, who reigned from 1095 to 1116, declared that the Holy Crown of Hungary, and not the king, was the true ruler of the realm.During World War II, the crown was whisked out of Hungary to protect it from falling into the clutches of the Nazis or Soviets. It resurfaced in Austria in 1945 and was handed over to American forces.The U.S. government brought the crown to Fort Knox for safekeeping. It remained there until 1978, when it was returned to Hungary by a delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.10. America's medicine cabinetWhat else has Fort Knox held, besides gold and historic artifacts? How about a hoard of drugs? Morphine sulfate, to be exact.During the Cold War, the U.S. military wanted to be certain that it had a healthy supply of pain meds in case foreign opium sources ever got cut off. So, in 1955, Fort Knox opened its doors to tons of opium.The government spent millions refining the stuff into morphine in 1993. It's still stored at Fort Knox, alongside the gold.That is, if the gold is really there.What to read nextWhite hot inflation is throwing off Americans' retirement plans — here's how to get back on track'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysAmericans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

If the downtrend continues we could see some speculative buys picking off some of the excess in the region,"" said Toby Copson, global head of trading at Trident LNG.""Near term, I expect further declines as we move into the Chinese Lunar New Year and then uptick as China gradually opens up economically and industrially.""China, the world's second largest LNG importer in 2022, abruptly ended its stringent zero-COVID policy last month after maintaining strict measures to curb the virus spread.While this has led to a surge in infections across the country, the upcoming Lunar New Year is expected to see passenger trips double to reach 2.1 billion this year. Mainland China is also set to open borders with its special administrative region of Hong Kong on Sunday, for the first time in three years.China's easing of COVID measures is forecast to spur demand for LNG, with imports expected to rise to between 70-72 million tonnes, say analysts, a 9-14% rise from last year but short of record import levels in 2021.In Europe, gas prices fell earlier in the week on mild weather and high stock levels, before edging up on colder temperatures.Northeast Asian delivered LNG prices however had fallen less sharply, said Samuel Good, head of LNG pricing at commodity pricing agency Argus, resulting in tighter discounts to or even turning to a premium over the Dutch TTF hub in some cases.""But interest from northeast Asian buyers largely remains tepid, with many still facing ample LNG terminal inventories, limiting the number of firms willing to compete for Atlantic LNG supply,"" he said.Story continues""There has been a reaction from European delivered LNG prices though, which have tightened their discounts to the TTF considerably in the past week or so.""S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily Northwest Europe LNG Marker price benchmark, for cargoes delivered in February on ex-ship (DES) basis, at $20.573 per mmBtu on Jan. 5, a discount of $1.25 per mmBtu to the February gas price at the Dutch TTF hub, said Ciaran Roe, global director of LNG.For cargoes delivered in March, the northeast Asia JKM derivative settled at a $0.45 per mmBtu premium to the Dutch TTF hub, and at a $1.35 per mmBtu premium to the Platts Northwest Europe LNG derivative, per assessments on Jan. 5.""If March JKM goes $2 per mmBtu over March TTF, then Northwest Europe will struggle to import flexible LNG, and it's likely Europe's gas hubs would have to move higher to compete,"" said Roe.On LNG freight, spot rates in both the basins extended losses this week on vessel availability in light of the latest delay to the restart of Freeport LNG in Texas, said Henry Bennett, global head of pricing at Spark Commodities.Spark's Atlantic rate for tankers on Friday fell to $120,750 per day, while the Pacific rate declined to $135,000 per day.

The recessionary fears, easing inflation, pull-back in the U.S. dollar, the Fed minutes and geopolitical risks are driving the metal higher, with analysts expecting further gains this year.As such, investors should tap the strength with the popular ETFs in the space. These funds below all have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).The Fed minutes revealed that the central bank will continue increasing the rates to control inflation but in a gradual way intended to limit the risks to economic growth. This has offered some relief to bullion as the dollar weakens on the prospect of smaller interest rate hikes after a stellar run in 2022 (read: Gold ETFs Shining on Bullion's Biggest Monthly Gain in 2 Years).Additionally, inflation in the United States has cooled down gradually, underscoring that the worst has likely passed. The consumer price index jumped 7.1% year over year in November, down from a 7.7% year-over-year increase in October and a peak of 9.1% in June. This represents the lowest annual increase since late 2021.Further, widespread COVID-19 cases in China have added to the gloom over a long-term slump in its property sector that has raised the demand for gold as a safe haven. This is because gold is often used as a means of preserving wealth during times of financial and political uncertainty. It usually does well when other asset classes struggle.Story continuesBullion prices were also boosted by increased safe-haven demand as the International Monetary Fund warned of a potential recession in 2023. A third of the global economy will be in recession this year, per the agency.Here’s a detailed discussion of the five ETFs mentioned earlier:SPDR Gold Trust ETFSPDR Gold Trust ETF tracks the price of gold bullion measured in U.S. dollars and is kept in London under the custody of HSBC Bank USA.

Job reductions at Tableau were greater, proportionally, than the company at large thus far.After a half-decade of fast hiring and large acquisitions, Salesforce is trying to cut costs and better integrate the companies it has purchased. The software maker, which lost almost half of its value in 2022, has been pressured by investors to improve profit. The job cuts made public Wednesday — about 8,000 workers — are less than half of the number of employees hired in the pandemic and followed the announced exit in December of co-CEO Bret Taylor and the elimination of hundreds of sales positions in November.Acquisitions fueled the company’s headcount growth. Tableau, then Salesforce’s most expensive deal when it was bought in 2019, came with 4,200 employees while Slack, purchased in 2021, and Mulesoft, acquired in 2018, together brought another 3,700, according to company filings. The three deals combined cost almost $50 billion with the estimated $27.7 billion for Slack leading the way. Workers across these acquired divisions were pummeled by the job reductions, particularly in recruiting and customer success roles, according to company employees.Story continuesTableau is increasingly being treated as a visualization tool for data contained in Salesforce’s other services rather than a standalone program — co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff highlighted the new integrations in a December keynote speech. The division has trailed the rest of the company in sales growth since the acquisition.“It makes a lot of sense to me that Tableau would have a disproportionate contribution to this layoff,” said John DiFucci of Guggenheim Research, who has covered Salesforce as an analyst for 12 years. “That company was not growing new business when they bought it, and they paid a lot.”Salesforce also plans to pare back its office footprint. The company currently has four offices in the Seattle area, more than any other city, according to the company website. Three were inherited in the Tableau deal. Salesforce declined to comment on whether it would be reducing space in the Seattle area.Asked about the effect of Wednesday’s job cuts on Tableau, a Salesforce spokesperson said the unit “is a vital part of our product strategy.” Tableau contributes to a product that “processes over 100 billion customer records, and helps our customers understand and act on their data,” the spokesperson said.Tableau and the other major acquired units are being reorganized, with the departure of many of the original executives brought on board in the deals. Last month, three top Slack executives including co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield said they were leaving and the division is now led by Lidiane Jones, who was a Salesforce executive.Insider earlier reported that Mulesoft employees were widely affected by Wednesday’s cuts. About a year ago, Bloomberg reported that Salesforce was struggling with a slowdown in sales growth and executive departures at Mulesoft, which helps customers connect their software across the internet. The exodus of key employees raised concerns the unit wouldn’t produce the gains expected by San Francisco-based Salesforce, the top seller of customer relations management software.Still, it seems that Salesforce executives are less excited about Tableau than its other new divisions. Corporate event transcripts compiled by Bloomberg show that Tableau receives far fewer mentions than Slack or Mulesoft when adjusting for length of time they’ve been with the company.The shuffling at the division accelerated after Adam Selipsky, who was Tableau CEO at the time of the deal, left in 2021 to run Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services cloud-computing unit, according to two people familiar with the matter. While Selipsky reported to Taylor, the Salesforce co-CEO, his successor at Tableau, Nelson, lost that access. Nelson reported to Chief Product Officer David Schmaier, before being moved under Executive Vice President Syam Nair.Nelson was pushed out of the company entirely in late December, and other Tableau executives had been forced out in the preceding months. On Wednesday, Tableau’s longtime philanthropy chief and other senior staff were let go.Most of the executives listed on Tableau’s leadership site when the acquisition was announced have since left the company. The Tableau leadership web page ceased to exist in mid-2022, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Today, the URL redirects to the page for Salesforce leadership, showing Benioff atop the company.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmerica’s Aggressive Chip Strategy Forces China Into a CornerThe Great American EV Battery Revolution Might Finally Be HerePoland’s Election Provides a Path Out of EU IsolationAfter the GOP’s Strife, the Big Winner Might Be Joe BidenUsed-Car Prices Are Finally Dropping©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Salesforce.com is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Salesforce.com, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Salesforce.comFor the fiscal year ending January 2023, this customer-management software developer is expected to earn $4.93 per share, which is a change of 3.1% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Salesforce.com. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8.2%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Salesforce.com to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our next guest is warning that Amazon has the most downside in 2023 due to cost headwinds and the potential for slowing consumption. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill joins us now. Brent, always good to see you.Pretty sizeable cuts here by Amazon. Do you think that is their initial down payment and we should expect more cuts from them in the months ahead?BRENT THILL: Expect more cuts for the rest of tech in the front half. The outlook is getting worse. Microsoft's CEO yesterday delivered a message that it's going to be two years before the next big tech inflection. That is from one of the most honest and upfront individuals that I know in the industry for the last 20 years. It's a very sobering outlook, and I don't know how to put this, but we're headed to a recession.Jefferies internal economists believe that this is going to start later and last longer. That is not good news. And so I think ultimately we're just seeing the beginning of what's to happen.Salesforce yesterday, again, big layoff. Elastic, Stitch Fix I think today had a big layoff. You look at across the board what's happening in tech and e-com. It's very sobering, and it's not good, and it's not a great sign of future demand.So ultimately I think we overhired as an industry into the pandemic. The pandemic created an artificial bubble, pulled demand forward. And then we come out of it, and we have a hangover, and then we had right to a recession. So that is just a toxic buildup, and it's going to take a while for that to stabilize.That then puts us at when's the next rebound? Is it 2024? In Nadella's terms, this might be 2025. And so in the short term, companies have no other choice but to tighten their belts, get back to growth at a profitable measure. Most of tech is growing with no regard to profitability, and that has to change because investors will drive those stocks to zero if they don't produce profitable growth. And so not a great outlook. Sorry to be so sober.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Yeah. No, it's a really sobering picture that we're all trying to wrap our heads around. And so with that in mind, part of what we had seen in terms of the issues for Salesforce was this issue of head count-- well, seat-count compression I should say, rather, and how much that actually might be a larger industry issue that we should just be waiting for the shoe to drop at other companies to give their updates on that similar basis.BRENT THILL: Yeah, I mean, it's a good point. So if you continue to lay people off-- and Salesforce and others are seat based. You need less seats, and theoretically you create shelfware, if you will. And that will sit around, and so as companies rehire, they may not have to actually bring back as many seats as they come back up.So again, this is a situation that we haven't seen for a long time. And ultimately, again, I think the pandemic-- every tech company tried to do-- to help everyone become virtual and remote, and unfortunately now you've got that unwinding. You've got the economy unwinding.And so the good news for tech is that multiples have compressed, and we're now seeing multiples that are, you know, in many cases, back at trough levels. And then the question now is how much lower do numbers and earnings have to go before we start to see stabilization?In our coverage, close to 80% to 90% of technology companies will show a deceleration in growth in 2023, and tech stocks don't work in decelerating growth. And so we believe in the mullet trade, you know, which is front half business, not really exciting. Back half, flowy, long, exciting.So we believe in the mullet trade. I think most of our clients are believing in the mullet trade where it's kind of business in front, party in back. Hopefully that plays out. It may end up just being a dragged-out, really tough 2023 is the risk, and it may end up being, you know, a back half '24 reemergence from this rather than sometime in early next year.So again, I think the picture, at least from our economists, continues to get worse. I am listening to our internal economists because they have been in front of the puck on this. And I've listened to them, and it's saved me from being too bullish. But tactically, I think there's only one way you can lean, which is when you have a CEO of the most admired company in tech, Microsoft, say it's two years before another tech inflection, that sums it up right there.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. You listen to him. I'm going to be waiting, Brent, for you to get the hairdo to match the strategy here. You need to do a little growing in the back.So, OK, business in the front, party in the back. What does that mean in terms of what companies fall into each of those categories?BRENT THILL: So I think when you think about-- internet names have been hit the hardest because they are immediate revenue streams. You feel it. Like, if you don't buy a $400 LEGO set, it shows up immediately in Amazon's numbers. It doesn't show up in Microsoft's numbers because they have recurring revenue that's on a subscription basis. It takes time for that to unwind. So I do think that some of the internet names are feeling it first. They're probably going to trough first and probably come out of this.Semiconductors-- our semi analyst has been very clear that all the adoption from Meta around AI is going to benefit Nvidia and other companies that are embedding artificial and ML into their platforms. That will help Nvidia. So our semi analyst's belief is that Nvidia and some of these other names are probably at the front end, and they've had numerous number cuts.So perhaps semis and the internet will be the ones that come back first. I think software still has some lag because they have recurrent contracts, and it takes time for that to unwind before you see the weakness. And so I think we believe semis and internet may lead us out. Software will probably be a lagging indicator. We talk about black ice. We are obviously seeing black ice today in a lot of these tech names in the market today.So I'd say if you think about in the back half of the year, I think a lot of the small- and mid-cap software names will do very well. They're trading at a massive discount to M&amp;A. Thoma Bravo, Vista, a number of the PE shops have been taking out companies at a 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% premium to where current stocks are trading now. So back half of the year we believe will be good for small and mid.And I think for large cap, you know, they're just-- they're still unwinding. So I'm actually a little more bullish about small and mid. So our strategists internally, Jefferies, around small and mid cap, they're coiled springs in the back half of the year.But again, I want to be very clear, I think the front half's going to be a lot of pain, and use an opportunity to buy into the pain. And potentially, again, I think for longer-term holders, this is going to be a great recovery over the next two years. This year again is we're kind of stuck in the swamp, if you will. There's going to be some pockets of up. But again, I don't see a great picture in the front half of the year. And it may continue, and we may end up coming back to you and saying we don't see a great picture for all of '23, and it may really just end up being the party in the back with the mullet comes in '24.BRIAN SOZZI: Brian, you mentioned Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and his latest warning this week. Well, does that make Microsoft shares dead money for the next two years?BRENT THILL: It's an unbeliev-- it's the best house in a bad neighborhood. So I think the answer for largely tech, we're stuck in a tight trading range.To answer your question, we like Microsoft long term. We have a $270 price target. We think this is one of the best franchises, one of the best management teams, one of the most ethical, just upstanding-- again, I think Nadella wins the award for the most admired person in my industry. And so I go back to you want a leader like him to lead through what's going on, and I have a huge admiration.I think, unfortunately, short term a lot of these names are stuck, and if you believe in a $10 earnings number for Microsoft, it's hard to argue that you're going to put anything past the 25 multiple. That would be $250 in the stock. And so we think, again, Microsoft's stuck between a $200 to $250 range if you took a 20 to 25 multiple on earnings. And again, stock you're showing right now at $224. We're kind of stuck right in the middle of that. So that would suggest, to your point to answer your question, it's kind of stuck in the short term until we have a breakout on what's happening in the overall environment.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I'm interested to see what Bing plus ChatGPT looks like, but that's a whole nother conversation.Brent Thill, thank you so much. It's good to see you. Sobering words, as you said, on what's going on in tech right now. Appreciate it.]"

As of 3 p.m., there are approximately 2,300 outages affecting 95,500 customers, with many in the North Coast, Bay Area and Central Coast areas. PG&amp;E recognizes the urgency of restoring power and will work diligently until all customers are restored.Hazards such as fallen trees, floods and debris flows have made gaining access difficult in some areas and could delay power restoration efforts. Additional storms are forecast over the coming week, which will likely also impact restoration times and lead to additional widespread outages.""Our crews are out in full force restoring customers safely and as quickly as possible. We are conducting assessments of damage and prioritizing repairs with a focus on critical facilities and resolving outages that are impacting the largest number of customers. We have a short window of time to make as much progress as we can before the next weather system in this series of storms enters our service area over the weekend,"" said Janisse Quiñones, PG&amp;E's Senior Vice President, Electric Operations.The brunt of the atmospheric river storm hit Wednesday, bringing wind gusts over 100 mph and as much as five inches of rain in some areas. This came on the heels of an earlier series of storms, resulting in highly saturated soils that have contributed to downed trees and debris flows.PG&amp;E prepared for this weather and has mobilized more than 3,000 PG&amp;E coworkers, contractors and mutual-aid personnel. Mutual aid crews from Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, Oregon, New Mexico, Utah and Washington are also supporting response efforts.Story continues""I'd like to recognize the thousands of dedicated professionals out there working tirelessly to get the lights back on for our hometowns,"" Quiñones said.Keeping Customers InformedCustomers can view real-time outage information at PG&amp;E's online outage center and search by a specific address, city or county. This site has been updated to include support in 16 languages.Additionally, customers can sign up for outage notifications by text, email, or phone. PG&amp;E will let customers know the cause of an outage, when crews are on their way, the estimated restoration time and when power has been restored.Storm Safety TipsNever touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer to prevent food spoilage.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns.Safely clean up: After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 8-1-1 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Other tips can be found at: Safety and Preparedness, Storm Safety, and Safety Action CenterAbout PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

The most vulnerable areas remained those in hillsides stripped bare of vegetation from past wildfires.The San Francisco Bay area, the state capital Sacramento and surrounding region were still recovering from extensive flood damage, including levee breaches along the Cosumnes River, when the latest bout of showers hit.The latest storm doused San Francisco with about 2 inches (51mm) of rain and the coastal mountains north and south of the city with 5 to 7 inches, according to meteorologist Rich Otto at the NWS Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.Snow accumulations of a foot (0.3 meters) to 18 inches or more were measured in the Sierras, the weather service said.Story continuesHigh-wind advisories and gale warnings were posted up and down the state, as uprooted trees, already weakened by drought and poorly anchored in rain-soaked soil, knocked down power lines and blocked roadways.Hazardous surf warnings were in effect for the state's three northernmost coastal counties - Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte - where three-story waves pounded the shoreline and crashed over beaches.HUMAN TOLLAuthorities have reported at least two weather-related deaths from the latest storm. A tree that crashed onto a trailer home overnight killed a 1- or 2-year-old boy, and a 19-year-old woman died when her car skidded off a partially flooded road into a utility pole on Wednesday.Four other deaths have been attributed to the New Year's weekend storm that swept northern California - three flood victims found in or near their cars and an elderly man found dead under a fallen tree.As many as 180,000 homes and businesses, mostly in northern and central California, were without power early on Thursday, according to data by Poweroutage.us.""This was one of the most powerful winter storms to hit our region in years,"" said Megan McFarland, a spokesperson for Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the main utility for northern and central California.Flooding, fallen trees and power lines left major roadways impassable in Point Arena and Gualala, two small Mendocino County coastal communities about 125 miles (201.17 km) north of San Francisco, which have experienced blackouts since Wednesday.Farther north at Noyo Harbor in Fort Bragg, professional urchin diver Grant Downie said he moved his boat out of the water ahead of the storm as a precaution.""The boat, insured or not, I feel safer with it on the truck getting hit by a tree than sinking in the water,"" he said.Crews in San Francisco spent the early morning hours clearing debris from felled trees that blocked roadways. The city's fire department rescued a family trapped when a tree fell across their car.Authorities advised Sonoma County residents near the Russian River between the wine country towns of Healdsburg and Jenner to evacuate their homes as the rain-swollen waterway neared flood stage.Evacuation warnings were also issued in oceanside towns such as Santa Cruz. Officials shut down a 55-mile stretch of Route 1, a scenic coastal highway, due to flooding and debris. In Santa Barbara County, homes were ordered evacuated in three areas where hill slopes were left denuded by wildfires.For Californians, the latest storms vividly illustrated the consequences of warmer sea and air temperatures wrought by climate change, producing atmospheric river storms with increasing frequency and intensity in the midst of extreme, multi-year drought.While the Sierra snowpack, a major source of California's water supply, was left at well above average for this time of year by the storms, much more will need to accumulate through winter to markedly diminish the drought, experts say.(Reporting by Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento Kate Fishman in Little River, Calif.; Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago, Joseph Ax in New York and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Josie Kao and Christian Schmollinger)]"

Walgreens announced plans to close five of its San Francisco stores due to organized retail shoplifting that has plagued its stores in the city. The retail pharmacy chain has already shuttered 10 stores in the city since 2019.The first earnings call of the year has given Walgreens an opportunity to make new resolutions.Last year, the pharmacy chain insisted on tackling theft in its stores as a matter of priority. At the time, Walgreens said the loss of inventory attributed to theft and damage was 40%-50% higher than it was prior to 2020. It even closed a handful of stores.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureBut this week, an executive said the company may have had an outsized reaction to the problem, and ultimately invested too much in “largely ineffective” private security. “Maybe we cried too much last year,” chief financial officer, James Kehoe, said in the Jan. 5 call, quoted in CNBC. “We’ve put in incremental security in the stores in the first quarter. Actually, probably we put in too much. We might step back a little bit from that,” he added.While shrinkage—the difference between inventory stacked and sold, largely due to shoplifting but also employee damage, loss, or theft—is a problem, it hasn’t affected the company’s performance as much as the billions of dollars of litigation costs it has had to pay for a range of reasons, from failing to have a pharmacist in charge to exacerbating America’s opioid crisis.In the quarter ending November 30, Walgreens posted a $3.7 billion loss over the hefty settlement reached in November for mishandling prescriptions for opioid medications that has fueled an addiction crisis in the country.Charted: Walgreens has paid around $7 billion in fines since 2000datawrapper-chart-Utd5LOne big number: $94.5 billion losses from organized retail theftWhile overblown, the retail theft problem still exists. Besides Walgreens, rival drugstore chain CVS, retailer Walmart, and home goods store Home Depot have all expressed concerns about robberies. Some have even started locking items up, much to the chagrin of customers.In its 2022 National Retail Security Survey, the National Retail Federation (NRF) found that retail shrink represents $94.5 billion in losses, up from $90.8 billion in 2020. Incidents of organized retail crime jumped up 26.5% in 2021 compared to the year prior. And not only does it affect inventory, some of these incidents also had an element of violence and aggression that spooked retail workers and customers alike.Story continuesMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

In that report, analysts expect Starbucks to post earnings of $0.76 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5.56%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.79 billion, up 9.19% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.41 per share and revenue of $35.97 billion. These totals would mark changes of +15.2% and +11.54%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Starbucks.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Parker-Hannifin is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Nordson has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that PH's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.49, while NDSN has a forward P/E of 25.03. We also note that PH has a PEG ratio of 1.31. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. NDSN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.93.Another notable valuation metric for PH is its P/B ratio of 4.35. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NDSN has a P/B of 5.93.These metrics, and several others, help PH earn a Value grade of B, while NDSN has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesPH sticks out from NDSN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PH is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD, Exxon Mobil XOM, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, and W.W. Grainger, Inc. GWW.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Dividend Aristocrats You Must Keep an Eye on in 2023After Wall Street’s S&amp;P 500 registered a nearly $8 trillion rout in 2022, the stock market continues to face more hurdles in 2023. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting showed that policymakers supported hiking interest rates this year to lower inflation toward their target range of 2%, even at the cost of rising unemployment and slower economic growth.The Fed, after aggressively hiking interest rates for four consecutive 75 basis points, increased the benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points at its latest meeting in December. What’s more, Fed officials continue to show a hawkish tilt, with more hikes anticipated this year than investors’ expectations.The minutes from the Fed’s Dec 13-14 meeting showed that none of the 19 top central bank officials expect any cut in interest rates in 2023, as they continue to wait for further evidence that inflation is slowing down at a sustainable rate. The Fed officials, in reality, have now increased the benchmark lending rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007.But such monetary tightening measures increase borrowing costs and curtail consumers’ propensity to spend, finally tipping the economy into a recession. Consumers, by the way, have already begun to spend less and U.S. manufacturing witnessed weakening demand, a tell-tale sign that the economy is slowing down.Per the Commerce Department, sales at U.S. retailers dropped 0.6% in November, twice the expected 0.3%. Similarly, manufacturing activity in the United States contracted in December for the second month in succession. The ISM manufacturing PMI came in at 48.4 last month, declining from 49 in November, its lowest level since May 2020.Story continuesMeanwhile, the International Monetary Fund predicted that one-third of the global economy might be in a recession this year, mostly due to a jump in prices, rate hikes, the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the spread of Covid in some parts of China. According to a new poll from Gallup, most Americans now think the United States will face great economic difficulty in 2023.All these gloomy developments don’t bode well for the stock market.

HST recently announced the amendment and restatement of its existing $2.5 billion credit facility (known as the “Agreement”) to boost liquidity position and financial flexibility.This involved the extension of the maturity from January 2025 to January 2028, inclusive of all extension options. The Agreement will continue to comprise a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and two $500 million term loans.The move did not result in any increase in the pricing of the facilities. It will continue to bear interest in accordance with a credit ratings-based grid ranging from 0.725%-1.600% over the applicable adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate.Per Sourav Ghosh, executive VP and CFO of Host Hotels, “We are extremely pleased to further enhance the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet with this refinancing, which reflects no increase in pricing.”The Agreement is also a reflection of Host Hotels’ industry-leading commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. It adds incentives linked to portfolio sustainability initiatives, including green building certifications and renewable electricity usage.As part of its sustainability targets, the company aims to increase the number of hotels in its portfolio with green building certifications to 38% by 2027. It also intends to increase the percentage of electricity used across its consolidated portfolio, which is generated by renewable resources, to 38% by 2027.There was no outstanding amount under the revolving credit facility other than the existing letters of credit at closing. Under the two term loans, the outstanding amount was $1 billion.Host Hotels has a portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the United States and abroad. With the lodging industry rebounding, HST’s well-located properties in markets with strong demand drivers, like central business districts of main cities, close to airports and in resort/conference destinations, are likely to benefit.The company has been making concerted efforts to dispose of non-strategic assets that have lower growth potential or properties with significant capital expenditure requirements through its capital-recycling program. It redeploys the proceeds to acquire or invest in premium properties in markets that are anticipated to recover faster.HST maintains a healthy balance sheet and is the only company with an investment-grade rating among lodging REITs. Moreover, its debt has a weighted average maturity of 5.2 years, an average interest rate of 4.4% and no material maturities until April 2024. With added balance-sheet strength, the company is well-poised to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities and facilitate redevelopment activities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.5% over the past six months against the industry’s fall of 9%.

80,5258926f-1fef-33d1-8d87-2584f2a4b21e,LUV,2023-01-06,Southwest Airlines forecasts loss after mass cancellations,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-expects-report-net-113930176.html,1673005170,STORY,['LUV'],"[By Abhijith Ganapavaram and Kannaki Deka(Reuters) -Southwest Airlines Co said on Friday it expects to post a loss in the fourth quarter after it canceled over 16,700 flights between Christmas and New Year's Eve due to a tech meltdown.The mass cancellations during the peak season for U.S. airlines will result in a pre-tax hit of $725 million to $825 million to quarterly earnings, said Southwest, which had earlier forecast a strong profit.Shares of the company were up 2.6% at $34.39 in mid-day trade.On Thursday, the Texas-based airline promised a thorough review of the operational collapse after a union leader said the carrier had not identified how to avoid a repeat.During winter storm Elliott, Southwest's crew scheduling software failed to bear the load of staffing changes made by the airline and workers had to manually match crew and planes that led to huge waiting times for pilots and cabin crew.The carrier is a popular option for customers looking for quick travel times as it relies on a point-to-point service to connect vast swathes of the country, instead of operating out of large hubs. But adverse weather made it difficult for it to marshal staff scattered across the nation.The impact from the cancellations will spill over to the current quarter, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said, after the company scrapped many flights in a bid to reset its system.Southwest, which led cancellations among U.S. carriers for much of the last two weeks of December, has invited scrutiny from the U.S. government and a lawsuit.PRESSURE FROM ALL SIDESThe White House has said Southwest ""failed its customers"", while the pilots union, which is in heated contract negotiations with Southwest, on Dec. 31 published a letter denouncing company leadership as a ""cult"" that has spent the last 15 years destroying the airline's legacy.""It is unclear to what extent this episode leads management to upgrade flight operations software, establish crew bases or the like,"" Citi Research analyst Stephen Trent said in a note.Story continuesBefore the recent crisis, Southwest had cultivated a reputation for reliable customer service, humorous flight crews and low-cost flights.Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan said in a video posted on the company's website on Thursday, following criticism from the union, the airline had made ""great progress"" in processing tens of thousands of refunds and reimbursements, and delivered the vast majority of bags that went missing.Bernstein analyst David Vernon said in a note earlier this week, ""it may take time for Southwest to repair its brand perception with investors.""Some investors, however, are still standing by the company.

Last year, Air Canada agreed to a $4.5 million settlement to resolve a USDOT investigation into claims that thousands of air passenger refunds had been delayed.

Buttigieg successfully prodded airlines in August to make ""significant changes"" to customer service plans. Nearly all agreed to offer passengers meals and overnight stays for delays within their control.In November, USDOT imposed penalties on another six airlines totaling just $7.25 million after they agreed to issue $622 million in passenger refunds.Some in Congress and many state attorneys general want USDOT to get tougher on airlines.In August,a bipartisan group of 36 state attorneys generalsaid they and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) should have new powers to investigate airline passengers' complaints.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230105005177/en/DAT has released the 2023 Freight Focus report (Graphic: Business Wire)DAT’s 2023 Freight Focus report outlines the issues that will drive transportation strategies and decisions in the year ahead.""COVID-19 didn’t introduce new problems in transportation. Instead, it shined a bright spotlight on existing ones. Now is the time to fortify supply chains and build a more dynamic and proactive way of navigating this volatile marketplace,"" said DAT President and CEO Claude Pumilia.As economic conditions evolve and patterns emerge from DAT’s $137 billion in annual truckload freight transaction data, here are the key themes for 2023:Supply chain networks are more balanced as shipping patterns stabilize and adjust to higher transportation costs. With shippers prioritizing the ""in full"" part of the On Time-In Full (OTIF) equation, fewer truckloads are needed to move even the same amount of consumer spending as during the height of the pandemic.With thinner margins in 2023, carriers need to maximize utilization. That means reducing empty miles, emphasizing fuel economy, and coordinating with shippers and brokers to reduce dwell times.The next freight cycle is around the corner. Spot truckload rates and volumes declined throughout 2022 while the gap between national average spot and contract van rates steadily increased until December when the spread began to close. DAT iQ forecasting models point to spot rates hitting bottom in Q1 2023, with the entire truckload market entering into the next cycle of increased demand in Q2.Supply chain data providers that entered the market within the last several years now have a track record. Shippers, brokers and carriers can more easily distinguish data services that deliver reliable pricing benchmarks and forecasts; are an independent source of data; understand the dynamics of trucking and logistics; and are in the market for the long haul.Story continues""Above all, finding a balance between cost control and flexibility will remain a focal point for businesses in 2023,"" Pumilia said. ""Analytics from trusted sources can go a long way toward providing transparency in negotiations, achieving savings and maintaining good relationships among transportation partners.""DAT’s 2023 Freight Focus report also outlines regulatory issues, top freight markets and keys to success for transportation decision-makers in 2023.

92,b82bc0fa-5416-3eac-94d5-554af47a373d,GS,2023-01-06,No more free coffee and layoff warnings—Goldman Sachs workers experience a rude awakening,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-more-free-coffee-layoff-192907988.html,1672946947,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Say hello to a lot of tired Goldman Sachs employees. Because instead of immediately letting go of Joe from sales, the investment bank is getting rid of its free cup of joe.A disgruntled employee recounted to the New York Post that when they went for their drip coffee in the office’s “Sky Lobby,” they were instead greeted with a different type of wake up call: ''a sign and a woman yelling at us that it was no longer complimentary.” They said they forked up $2.99 for a “sh–ty cup of Seattle’s Best.”“Nothing says ‘Happy New Year’ like ‘You’re already on the verge of losing your jobs—but let’s just make sure you lose your free coffee, too,” they added, referring to Chief Executive Officer David Solomon’s warning that the bank could begin layoffs in the first half of January.In his end-of-year message, Solomon spoke of a “headcount reduction” in response to many factors, including “tightening monetary conditions that are slowing down economic activity.” As much as 8% of the company’s workforce, or 4,000 workers, could potentially be affected.It seems that coffee, too, is on the chopping block, although Goldman spokesperson Abbey Collins notes to Fortune that “there is free coffee available to all employees on every floor—from drip coffee to espresso drinks."" Barista-style coffee machines were installed in every pantry in the building in 2022, but employees complained to the Post they’re often broken or don’t produce tasty coffee.Bye, bye perksAt the start of the pandemic, Wall Street seemed to be a different beast from its famously stressful culture, looking more like a lamb than a bull as financiers transitioned to Zoom meetings. But big names like Goldman Sachs seem to be done with the era of increased flexibility. Famously anti-remote work, Solomon ushered employees back starting last March; the office has since nearly reached pre-pandemic levels of occupancy. During the Omicron resurgence, Solomon told Fortune that the key to Goldman’s success was in part down to young and more senior workers coming together and collaborating in-person.Story continuesHe’s also slowly been rolling back pandemic perks: Free daily car rides, a free coffee cart in the lobby, and breakfast and lunch service all went away last year. The drip coffee, implemented during the pandemic, is just the latest pandemic perk he pulled back. Some workers previously pointed out that the disappearance of these perks would mostly affect entry-level employees, as higher-ups could often still afford or be gifted nice lunches or coffee.Goldman isn’t the only major financial player ending its freebie era. Morgan Stanley took away free tickets to the U.S. Open tennis championship last year, a pre-pandemic perk that was once available to top performers at the bank. JP Morgan also ended their free sports tickets.Over in tech, Meta suspended its laundry service last March, before ending the year with layoffs. And Google CEO Sundar Pinchai said he was “simplifying the company” and that “we shouldn’t always equate fun with money"" as he reeled in extra spending. TikTok, too, ended its daily meal stipend for employees based outside of its hubs. While none of this means that layoffs are for sure coming, the tightening of wallets isn’t always a promising sign for these sectors that are swinging back from their early pandemic boom.It’s shifting culture in major industries. In finance, a group of Goldman junior bankers may have spoken out against the crushing workload nearly two years ago, but Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Fortune in July a potential recession might weaken the power of finance employees. “This is a time to treat Wall Street the way it was treated for generations,"" he said.“If you’re an employee of Wall Street, you better have your eyes wide open,” he added. But that might be hard to do if they’re caffeine-deprived.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: San Francisco being hit with a ‘brutal’ storm so severe that a meteorologist says is ‘one of the most impactful’ he’s ever seenHow will the ultrawealthy ride out the recession? 1,200 investors worth $130 billion have one big strategyBlaming Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest on the COVID vaccine is ‘wildly and irresponsibly speculative,’ says expertMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

(GS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-group-inc-gs-140002639.html,1672927202,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Goldman Sachs (GS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned -3.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Goldman falls in, has lost 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Goldman is expected to post earnings of $6.44 per share, indicating a change of -40.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $33.16 points to a change of -44.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.3%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $37.29 indicates a change of +12.5% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Goldman.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Goldman, the consensus sales estimate of $11.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -11.6%. The $47.56 billion and $51.32 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19.9% and +7.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGoldman reported revenues of $11.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12%. EPS of $8.25 for the same period compares with $14.93 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.37%. The EPS surprise was +10.44%.Over the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Goldman is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now, CEO Andy Jassy said the move would impact Amazon's stores and the group's people experience and tech solutions divisions. Now for many employees, the next few weeks will be excruciating as they won't find out if they've been laid off until January 18.So, I mean, a lot of people were shocked that this was perhaps an even greater set of layoffs than expected. We know that a lot of tech companies have been having layoffs, overhired too much during the pandemic without really sort of thinking what the long-term vision would be, but much more than expected here.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Andy Jassy saying in a letter to employees that essentially companies that last a long time go through different phases. They're not in heavy people-expansion mode every year. But in many ways, this is kind of a similar story that we've heard from so many other tech companies. It is that we grew too quickly during the pandemic. Now there is a whiplash happening in the other direction where they're having to cut costs, especially in the face of an uncertain economic environment.Amazon obviously getting a lot of criticism, largely because Andy Jassy is still relatively new in this role. And the question I think internally could be then become, well, can he, like Jeff Bezos, be able to navigate some of these headwinds?I thought it was some interesting commentary this morning though, Rachelle. Brent Thill from Jefferies on our morning show saying that the pandemic created a type of bubble for these tech companies, that things grew too quickly. We have heard this over and over. We hired too many people. We expanded too quickly. And now you're seeing the reckoning on the other end.And he says specifically that he doesn't think there's going to be a real turnaround until 2024 and that 80% to 90% of tech companies will show decelerated growth this year. And you see all the names on the screen right there. This is not an Amazon-specific story, although 18,000 is a significant number, in terms of tech companies really looking at their balance sheets and say, we're going to have to shrink a little more. We're going to have to be a little more cost efficient because the economics just don't look good right now, and there's a lot of uncertainty.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, even when you think of within the companies themselves, you have the broader tech sell-off that we've seen, but also within the companies, their individual problems-- growing too fast. Perhaps also as we look at the case of Amazon, this e-commerce boom-- yes, it was, of course, going to boom during the pandemic, but what was going to happen afterwards? There was going to be some sort of normalcy, some sort of leveling off. And there are a lot more players in this space now. You have your Walmarts taking some of their market share as well. So we figured at some point there was going to be a sort of leveling off.But as we look at individual stories-- for example, when you think of Tesla and the issues with Twitter. Each has their own sort of individual problems that are just compounding the broader tech sell-off at the moment.AKIKO FUJITA: It is also about companies really having to find their focus. I mean, you talked about e-commerce with Amazon. That's certainly been slowing down. We've seen that reflected in their earnings.But when you think about this letter that Andy Jassy has put out, you know, where they're actually making the cuts, it is about the company doubling down on things that have been really working for them. Obviously cloud and AWS continue to be a big driver for them. You look at some other companies like Salesforce yesterday coming out, and they're saying they're going to be cutting 10% of their workforce.So we're increasingly hearing from these companies not just about the growth that they saw-- the outsized growth, I should say, they saw over the last few years but also the need to focus a little more, not dabble in-- not, you know, loss-making ventures but also really focus on where the revenue drivers are and really be profitable.At the end of the day, it's not growth at all costs anymore. It is about profitability, and for these publicly traded companies, that is number one in terms of what investors are looking at.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. And it is worth noting that these layoffs represent 1.2% of their entire workforce, so some context there. Obviously it's a lot of people, still obviously 18,000, but when you think of the size of an Amazon, worth keeping that in mind as well.]"

Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the consolidated company. Adjusted EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, including amounts that will be attributable to noncontrolling interests, which are not reasonably estimable at this time.

Less capacity has driven up refiners' profit margins and utilization rates as demand recovered.""Last summer, we saw demand back close to 2019 levels and saw margins, frankly, I didn't think we'd see and hadn't seen historically,"" said Dietert.""As we approach the summer driving season, we expect gasoline and diesel to be tight again this summer,"" he said.U.S. gasoline and diesel stocks fell last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Thursday.Another U.S. refinery, Lyondell Basell Industries 's 263,776 barrel-per-day (bpd) Houston refinery, is scheduled to close by the end of this year, further reducing U.S. capacity.The loss will be mitigated by the planned expansion of Exxon Mobil Corp's Beaumont, Texas, refinery's coming on-line. It could add about 250,000 bpd capacity.Phillips 66 Chief Executive Mark Lashier said the Houston-based company is working to better integrate its seven U.S. refineries.""We want to standardize the way we run our refinery business, we want to optimize across the platforms, technologies that we've put in place will enable that,"" Lashier said. ""We really think it's the way to position ourselves competitively.""Kevin Mitchell, chief financial officer, said the company plans to return its Rodeo, California, refinery to production in 2024 after completing the conversion of the plant to renewable diesel.""That's another approximately $700 million of EBITDA, which is going to translate into about the same from a cash standpoint,"" Mitchell said of the financial gains expected from the converted refinery.

100,7c6d9b8d-09ca-3d24-9679-bf0ee9193cd4,NEM,2023-01-06,Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Newmont Corporation's (NYSE:NEM) Stock Up Recently?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/financials-role-play-driving-newmont-111140121.html,1673003500,STORY,['NEM'],"[Newmont's (NYSE:NEM) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Newmont's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Newmont How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Newmont is:1.4% = US$291m ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.01 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Newmont's Earnings Growth And 1.4% ROEIt is hard to argue that Newmont's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 20%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Despite this, surprisingly, Newmont saw an exceptional 27% net income growth over the past five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Newmont's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 34% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is NEM fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Newmont Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 59% (implying that it keeps only 41% of profits) for Newmont suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders.Besides, Newmont has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 72% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Newmont is speculated to rise to 8.3% despite the anticipated increase in the payout ratio. There could probably be other factors that could be driving the future growth in the ROE.SummaryOverall, we feel that Newmont certainly does have some positive factors to consider. That is, quite an impressive growth in earnings. However, the low profit retention means that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Nuclear Energy and Reactor Companies in the World.Nuclear energy has been in the conversation lately partly due to its ability to provide clean energy as the world transitions to zero emissions but also in part due to the rising geopolitical tensions around the world. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has increased concerns around geographic sovereignty, with countries like Belgium and Japan declaring to prolong the lifetime of their nuclear plants.Although the use of nuclear weapons in war situations is certainly an issue of concern for the world, the use of nuclear energy for the production of energy is a more refreshing concept. Nuclear power facilities emit almost no greenhouse gases, and in the last five decades, around 70 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions have been avoided by using nuclear power. The amount of carbon dioxide emission per unit of electricity through nuclear power plants is equivalent to one-third compared to solar power. In support of the struggle for a zero-carbon world, more than 200 countries vowed to a phasing down of coal for energy use at the CoP26 climate summit in 2021, and as the transition occurs, nuclear power will continue to get further traction among climate activists.Scientists have continued to make strides in nuclear technology, and recently, a group of researchers in the United States were able to successfully complete nuclear fusion ignition, which is a process involving the bombarding of light elements to form heavier elements. Nuclear fusion is a reaction reported to generate more energy than the energy used to start the reaction. Although we are still in the early stages of this technology, the potential of nuclear fusion is immense since it can sustainably provide low-carbon energy.Nuclear fusion startups have been generating interest among investors owing to the potential of the technology. TAE Technologies, a startup working on producing energy through nuclear fusion, raised $250 million earlier in July 2022, with Google and Chevron Corporation being part of the funding round. With the recent breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology, the space is set to attract large investment inflows over the coming years. According to Bloomberg, investments in nuclear fusion tech amounted to $1 billion in 2022, a triple-fold increase in funding from 2020.Story continuesBiggest Nuclear Energy and Reactor Companies in the worldCopyright: vencavolrab78 / 123RF Stock PhotoSetting up a large-scale nuclear power plant requires significant spending and capital investments which is why the space is dominated by government-owned entities around the world. The issue of large upfront capital investments is addressed through SMRs (small modular reactors). These reactors are smaller in size and power output compared to traditional reactors and can generate power up to 300 MW. Apart from requiring significantly less capital investment, these plants are mobile and can be set up and transported to the site where they are required. These plants have relatively simple designs and are relatively safer in nature due to their smaller size. Although there are some advantages attached with SMRs, recent studies have found out that SMRs actually generate more nuclear waste than conventional nuclear plants. As per the report, SMRs would produce 30 times more radioactive waste per unit of power generated than traditional reactors.According to International Energy Agency (IEA) data, global energy generation from nuclear plants increased by 3.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reversing a decline of over 4% brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 439 nuclear reactors were in operation as of May 2022 in about 30 different nations. At the time, the United States had the most operational nuclear power reactors, with 92 units. The number of new reactors under construction reached 55 as of May 2022, including 2 in the United States and 18 in China. The total electricity supplied by nuclear power plants throughout 2021 was reported at 2653.1 TWh, accounting for 10% of the total global electricity generation, which is forecasted to increase to 14% by 2050.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 15 biggest nuclear energy and reactor companies in the world, we identified the biggest nuclear energy and reactor companies and ranked these companies in ascending order in order of their market cap. In the case of private companies, we have used the annual revenue of 2021 to estimate each company's market capitalization. For these companies we used a price-to-revenue multiple of 2 as a crude measure of market value. We should also note that most of the US based nuclear energy companies have other operations that generate significant percentage of their revenues, and we made no effort to estimate the value of their nuclear energy operations. Instead, we used the entire market cap of these companies in our rankings.15 Biggest Nuclear Energy and Reactor Companies in the World15.

A sharp drop in distillates and shrinking gasoline inventories also showed that crude consumption remained strong through the holiday season.China, the world’s largest crude importer, said on Thursday that it will reopen its border with Hong Kong by January 8, in another step away from the country’s strict zero-COVID policy. The move ramped up expectations of an eventual economic recovery in the country, which is expected to spur a sharp bounceback in oil demand.Brent oil futures rose 0.8% to $79.44 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1.1% to $74.44 a barrel by 21:23 ET (02:23 GMT). While both contracts marked a second straight day of recovery from three-week lows, they were still set to lose about 7.5% this week after a dismal start to the new year.Strength in the dollar limited gains in crude prices on Friday, as investors awaited U.S. nonfarm payrolls data that is expected to show some easing in the country’s tight jobs market.But markets were wary of any signs of resilience in the jobs market, which could give the Federal Reserve more headroom to maintain its hawkish rhetoric.The minutes of the central bank’s December meeting showed that policymakers support smaller rate hikes in the coming months. But they also called for U.S. interest rates to stay higher for longer, a scenario that could weigh further on economic activity, and dent crude demand.Story continuesOil prices plummeted in the first two sessions of 2023 after the International Monetary Fund warned of a potential recession in several major economies. Weak economic prints from the world’s two largest oil consumers- the U.S. and China- added to concerns over a recession, as both countries saw manufacturing activity shrink in December.Rising COVID-19 cases in China also brewed fears of a staggered reopening in the country, even as the government moves further away from its strict zero-COVID policy. The country is dealing with its worst-yet COVID-19 outbreak, which analysts warn could stymie economic growth in the near-term and cause increased market volatility.Related ArticlesOil extends rebound on positive demand cues, but still set for weekly lossesGold turns flat before payrolls data, copper cheered by China reopeningMichigan Democratic Senator Stabenow will not seek re-election in 2024]"

But given that the reading has consistently topped estimates for eight months running, markets fear that any signs of resilience in the jobs market will give the Fed enough headroom for more hawkish moves.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,834.53 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,839.25 an ounce by 19:50 ET (00:50 GMT). Still, both instruments were set for a 0.5% gain this week- their third straight week in black.Gold prices were supported by recent signals from the Fed that the central bank will likely raise interest rates at a slower pace in 2023, after a series of sharp hikes in the prior year. Fears of a looming recession in 2023 also saw bullion prices benefit from a resurgence in safe haven demand.But central bank policymakers indicated that they will likely hold rates higher for longer, with curbing inflation being their main focus. This has brewed much uncertainty over exactly where U.S. rates will peak, given that inflation is still well above the Fed’s target 2% rate.The Fed also indicated that it will look for some cooling in the job market to ease its hawkish rhetoric. But so far, the U.S. labor market has remained resilient despite headwinds from slowing growth.Safe haven demand helped gold largely outperform other precious metals for the week. Platinum futures were down 1.3% this week, while silver futures shed nearly 3%.Among industrial metals, copper prices traded flat after sharply reversing recent losses on Thursday after the Chinese government said it will reopen the border with financial hub Hong Kong on January 8.Story continuesThe move points to the relaxing of more anti-COVID curbs in China, and ramped up optimism over a broader reopening in the country. Copper futures were flat around $3.8252 a pound and were headed for a third straight week of gains, following an over 2% rally on Thursday.Still, China is facing an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases after the country relaxed curbs in December.

(NASDAQ:RICK) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13 Texas-based RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) operates strip clubs, nightclubs and adult clubs. The company is on an M&amp;A spree over the past few months. In December, it bought an adult nightclub's assets in Fort Worth, Texas, for $2.4 million cash. RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) had announced that it planned to buy two Baby Dolls and three Chicas Locas adult nightclubs and their associated real estate in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston markets for $66.5 million.RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) is also a dividend-paying stock. In December, RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) declared a $0.05/share quarterly dividend, in line with previous.13 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey are bullish on the company.Here is what Greystone Capital Management has to say about RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:RICK) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“As I’ve said before, a frustrating element of today’s market environment is having to watch one of our businesses perform brilliantly quarter after quarter while the stock price either declines or barely reacts to positive operating results. RICK continues to perform well in both their nightclub and Bombshells segments, with their recent 11-club acquisition set to contribute nicely to both the top and bottom line during FY22, while Bombshells growth will continue as the company expands both corporate and franchise locations. In January, RICK stock reached an all-time high of $92/share, only to decline nearly 50% to today’s price as macro concerns dominate the mood and capital flows away from retail, consumer discretionary and restaurant stocks. While RICK’s industry/sector is a tough one for many investors to wrap their heads around owning right now, I believe the company is being unfairly lumped into the broader restaurant and consumer discretionary categories while being compared with weaker and less attractive peers. So why would we want to own RICK? In terms of navigating the current or potential economic environment, RICK’s variable cost structure, balance sheet and access to capital provide significant advantages. The business has pricing power on both the service and alcohol sides, has assets to monetize, and is on a mission to acquire another $20mm of EBITDA by 2023 via accretive M&amp;A where they serve as the buyer of choice for mom-and-pop nightclub operators. Should they achieve this goal, shares would be trading at around 5x next year’s EBITDA making RICK one of the cheapest stocks in the entire restaurant universe. This isn’t lost on management, who are repurchasing shares hand over fist at a high free cash flow yield while the stock trades at unreasonable levels…” (Click here to see the full text) 14.

(NASDAQ:PENN) announced a $750 million stock buyback program. In November, the stock remained in the news after a disclosure showed that Goldman Sachs had purchased 4.5 million shares of the company in the third quarter. Analysts speculated that this activity should be a sign of an initiative by an activist investor.  Insider Monkey’s data shows that PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN)’s biggest stakeholder as of the end of the third quarter was Parag Vora’s HG Vora Capital Management, which owns a $206 million stake in the company.Baron Funds made the following comment about PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of gaming company PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) declined 9.6% in the quarter and penalized performance by 10 bps. This was due to investor concerns that a potential recession would result in a slowdown or decline in its earnings growth rate. However, thus far, the company has seen no material change to visitation or spending levels, and its earnings remain strong. PENN is generating strong cash flow, which it continues to use to invest in its digital growth opportunity, while using excess cash to buy back its stock. PENN is well positioned to weather a slowdown or recession, and we believe that even if one does occur, the company would still generate revenue and EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels. We consider the $50 million of losses this year from its digital business to be modest in relation to PENN’s over $1 billion of EBITDA from its casino business. The losses from its digital business represent customer acquisition costs incurred as additional states legalize online gambling. Since it is far less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, we expect marketing costs to decline as PENN builds its customer base. PENN’s core bricks and mortar casino business remains strong, and the company’s healthy regional casino business and strong balance sheet enable it to absorb its digital losses.” 8. Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 Another alcoholic beverage company on our list, Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) is a Canadian company that sells a variety of beer and drinks brands.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.National Grid has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that NGG's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.NGG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.98, while NEE has a forward P/E of 27.06. We also note that NGG has a PEG ratio of 2.14. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.80.Another notable valuation metric for NGG is its P/B ratio of 1.58. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NEE has a P/B of 3.59.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help NGG earn a Value grade of B, while NEE has been given a Value grade of D.NGG is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

115,b78f91db-c3d5-305a-b957-f7230de9e823,NEE,2023-01-06,NextEra (NEE) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-nee-considered-good-investment-143002524.html,1672929002,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about NextEra Energy (NEE).NextEra currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.40, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 10 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.40 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 10 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 80% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NEECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for NextEra here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying NextEra, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is NEE Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.89.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for NextEra.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A sharp drop in distillates and shrinking gasoline inventories also showed that crude consumption remained strong through the holiday season.China, the world’s largest crude importer, said on Thursday that it will reopen its border with Hong Kong by January 8, in another step away from the country’s strict zero-COVID policy. The move ramped up expectations of an eventual economic recovery in the country, which is expected to spur a sharp bounceback in oil demand.Brent oil futures rose 0.8% to $79.44 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1.1% to $74.44 a barrel by 21:23 ET (02:23 GMT). While both contracts marked a second straight day of recovery from three-week lows, they were still set to lose about 7.5% this week after a dismal start to the new year.Strength in the dollar limited gains in crude prices on Friday, as investors awaited U.S. nonfarm payrolls data that is expected to show some easing in the country’s tight jobs market.But markets were wary of any signs of resilience in the jobs market, which could give the Federal Reserve more headroom to maintain its hawkish rhetoric.The minutes of the central bank’s December meeting showed that policymakers support smaller rate hikes in the coming months. But they also called for U.S. interest rates to stay higher for longer, a scenario that could weigh further on economic activity, and dent crude demand.Story continuesOil prices plummeted in the first two sessions of 2023 after the International Monetary Fund warned of a potential recession in several major economies. Weak economic prints from the world’s two largest oil consumers- the U.S. and China- added to concerns over a recession, as both countries saw manufacturing activity shrink in December.Rising COVID-19 cases in China also brewed fears of a staggered reopening in the country, even as the government moves further away from its strict zero-COVID policy. The country is dealing with its worst-yet COVID-19 outbreak, which analysts warn could stymie economic growth in the near-term and cause increased market volatility.Related ArticlesOil extends rebound on positive demand cues, but still set for weekly lossesGold turns flat before payrolls data, copper cheered by China reopeningMichigan Democratic Senator Stabenow will not seek re-election in 2024]"

But given that the reading has consistently topped estimates for eight months running, markets fear that any signs of resilience in the jobs market will give the Fed enough headroom for more hawkish moves.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,834.53 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,839.25 an ounce by 19:50 ET (00:50 GMT). Still, both instruments were set for a 0.5% gain this week- their third straight week in black.Gold prices were supported by recent signals from the Fed that the central bank will likely raise interest rates at a slower pace in 2023, after a series of sharp hikes in the prior year. Fears of a looming recession in 2023 also saw bullion prices benefit from a resurgence in safe haven demand.But central bank policymakers indicated that they will likely hold rates higher for longer, with curbing inflation being their main focus. This has brewed much uncertainty over exactly where U.S. rates will peak, given that inflation is still well above the Fed’s target 2% rate.The Fed also indicated that it will look for some cooling in the job market to ease its hawkish rhetoric. But so far, the U.S. labor market has remained resilient despite headwinds from slowing growth.Safe haven demand helped gold largely outperform other precious metals for the week. Platinum futures were down 1.3% this week, while silver futures shed nearly 3%.Among industrial metals, copper prices traded flat after sharply reversing recent losses on Thursday after the Chinese government said it will reopen the border with financial hub Hong Kong on January 8.Story continuesThe move points to the relaxing of more anti-COVID curbs in China, and ramped up optimism over a broader reopening in the country. Copper futures were flat around $3.8252 a pound and were headed for a third straight week of gains, following an over 2% rally on Thursday.Still, China is facing an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases after the country relaxed curbs in December. Analysts have warned that this trend could delay a broader reopening, and also cause near-term market volatility.Related ArticlesGold turns flat before payrolls data, copper cheered by China reopeningOil prices extend gains on lower U.S. fuel inventoriesMichigan Democratic Senator Stabenow will not seek re-election in 2024]"

(NYSE:BAX), a leading global medtech company, today announced a comprehensive strategic roadmap to meaningfully enhance its operational effectiveness, drive toward improved long-term performance, accelerate innovation and create additional value for all stakeholders. These changes include the plan to spin off the company’s Renal Care and Acute Therapies global business units (GBUs) into an independent, publicly traded company; a simplified commercial and manufacturing footprint to enhance underlying business performance; and further portfolio actions to improve Baxter’s capital structure, including a review of strategic alternatives for the BioPharma Solutions (BPS) business.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230105005939/en/""We are at a major inflection point in Baxter’s ongoing transformation journey,"" said José (Joe) E. Almeida, chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""The healthcare landscape has never been more dynamic. Our learnings over the past year and beyond require a fundamental rethinking of our profile and operating model. These decisive actions are necessary to help deliver future performance and innovation at the levels we demand of ourselves in pursuit of our Mission to Save and Sustain Lives.""Mr. Almeida continued, ""We are confident that the strategic actions we are announcing today will help ensure that each of these entities, and the incredibly strong and dedicated group of colleagues that comprise them, are on the best possible trajectory moving forward. Realizing the full impact of these decisions will take time, but we believe they are essential to enhance our focus, fuel our innovative spirit, and, most crucially, deliver optimal results for the patients, clinicians, shareholders, and other stakeholder communities that depend on us.""Story continuesCreation of Standalone Kidney Care CompanyBaxter’s Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses are leaders in the global kidney care industry. As an independent, publicly traded company, the new kidney care business would carry forward Baxter’s nearly 70-year legacy as a pioneer and leader in kidney disease therapies. The new business would continue to serve as a trusted partner to providers and clinicians around the world, focusing on improving outcomes for the more than one million patients it serves annually in more than 70 countries.The new kidney care company will benefit from its existing leading product portfolio, geographically diverse footprint, and extensive commercial operations, as well as from robust service capabilities that support its therapies delivered in the home, clinics, and intensive care unit (ICU). As a standalone entity with its own investment priorities and enhanced management focus, the new kidney care company will be better positioned to pursue growth opportunities and invest in innovation.The business will operate in market segments totaling approximately $15 billion that collectively are estimated to grow between 3% to 4% on a compound annual basis over the next three years. The company will have leading positions in the businesses in which it operates, meaningful financial scale, and opportunities to expand margins in the near term and beyond. In 2021, sales for these businesses totaled approximately $5 billion globally.New Operating Model to Simplify Baxter’s OperationsOver the past several years, Baxter has executed many initiatives to strengthen its ability to deliver on its vision to transform healthcare. To better achieve these goals, the company is working to finalize a new operating model that it will begin to implement in parallel with its planning for the proposed spinoff of the Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses.Once the simplified model is finalized and implemented, Baxter is expected to be a more integrated and nimble organization that can respond to changes in the environment faster and more effectively, while enhancing its ability to advance innovation for its patients. This simplified structure should create a more resilient supply chain and greater alignment with the company’s manufacturing footprint, better positioning the organization to deliver against the operational and investment priorities of Baxter’s businesses. As part of this organizational redesign, the company expects to initiate a restructuring plan, including optimization of its manufacturing footprint. Baxter plans to provide additional detail on these efforts in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings conference call on Feb. 9, 2023.After the completion of the reorganization and the proposed spinoff of the new kidney care company, Baxter’s market-leading businesses will continue to compete in large and growing segments, which total more than $100 billion in size and taken together are expected to grow approximately 3% on a compound annual basis over the next three years. On a pro forma basis, including Hillrom as if it were owned for the entire year, 2021 annual sales across these businesses (excluding Renal Care and Acute Therapies) were approximately $11 billion. Baxter will continue to be led by CEO Joe Almeida.Strategic Alternatives for BioPharma Solutions (BPS) BusinessBaxter is pursuing strategic alternatives for the BPS business, including a potential sale or other separation options. BPS is a provider of contract manufacturing services to the pharma and biotech industries with an established track record and strong reputation for quality. The business has continued opportunities for growth, but its business model and client focus have limited strategic alignment with the rest of Baxter’s portfolio. A potential sale of, or other strategic transaction involving, this business would help Baxter further streamline its focus while providing an opportunity for capital redeployment in accordance with its stated capital allocation priorities, including debt repayment.Updated Strategic &amp; Capital Allocation FocusFollowing the proposed operating model redesign and spinoff, Baxter should emerge as a stronger hospital solutions and connected care company. As a more focused business, Baxter will be better positioned to make strategic investments to accelerate its vision, delivering differentiated value to all stakeholders with its unique combination of products, therapies and connected care platforms.By increasing R&amp;D investments in higher-growth and more strategic opportunities, Baxter will drive innovation to help accelerate sales growth, better serve patients and customers, and provide new opportunities for employees. The company will also have the opportunity to expand investments in marketing, sales, and business development, while optimizing its manufacturing network and systems to improve its margin profile and create value.Transaction DetailsThe Baxter Board of Directors authorized the company to proceed with a plan to spin off the Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses into an independent, publicly traded company through a distribution to Baxter shareholders of common stock of a newly formed entity holding assets and liabilities comprising the Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses. Baxter intends for the spinoff to qualify as tax-free to Baxter and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.Baxter expects to complete the proposed spinoff in 12 to 18 months, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval from the Baxter Board of Directors, the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement on Form 10, receipt of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruling or related tax opinions from counsel, satisfactory completion of financing arrangements, consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies, and any necessary regulatory approvals.Baxter will provide updates in due course as the proposed spinoff progresses, including detailed information on the spinoff and relevant financial information, which will be included in an exhibit to a registration statement on Form 10 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Baxter is targeting maintenance of an investment grade credit rating (including after giving effect to the proposed reorganization and spinoff). The proposed leadership, governance, capital structure, dividends and other matters for the new kidney care company will be announced at a later date.There can be no guarantee that the spinoff, the simplified operating model, or the sale of, or other strategic transaction involving, the BPS business will be completed in the manner or over the timeframes described above, or at all.AdvisorsPerella Weinberg Partners LP and J.P. Morgan are serving as financial advisors to Baxter. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP is serving as legal advisor to Baxter.Investor Call DetailsBaxter plans to hold an investor call today, January 6, 2023, at 7:30 a.m. CST to discuss this announcement.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has gained 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.04 points to a change of +2.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.28 indicates a change of +2.3% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.79 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $95.02 billion and $98.01 billion estimates indicate +1.3% and +3.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.2%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moreover, Proclinical estimates that the medical device industry was worth $488.98 billion in 2021 and projects that it could reach a value of $718.92 billion by 2029, representing a significant runway for growth.Yet, despite being a leading company in this growing industry, Medtronics stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 14.66 based on Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) analysts estimates for fiscal 2023 earnings (the companys fiscal year ends in April). The stock also looks modestly undervalued based on its GF Value chart:Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MDT. Click here to check it out. MDT 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MDTPeter Lynch Chart of MDTMedtronic: Can This Medical Device Maker Turn Itself Around?Problems with some of the companys products, allegations of poor management and upcoming spinoffs (read: downsizing) are all contributing to the markets negative view of the stock. If these issues continue, it is possible the stock could remain undervalued for some time. The question for investors is, can this medical device maker turn itself around in a way that will benefit shareholders?Product issuesMedtronics MiniMed developed the first Food and Drug Administration-approved Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) system in 1999, and the company has long been a global leader in medical devices for diabetes care. The company is also known for its revolutionary cardiac devices, which include battery-powered and miniature pacemakers.However, while we like to think of technological innovations solely as positive developments, oftentimes new innovations come with unforeseen complications and risks. A good example of this is Medtronics MiniMed insulin pump, a system that automatically adjusts background insulin depending on the bodys needs.In December 2021, the FDA issued a warning letter to Medtronic over a past issue with faulty retainer rings on the MiniMed. While Medtronic had taken action to correct the issue beginning in 2016 and eventually did issue a recall in November 2019 after 74,000 complaints of faulty retainer rings, the FDA alleges that the company was too slow to issue a recall and did not notify the FDA properly of the defect.Story continuesThe MiniMeds problems do not end there. In January 2022, Medronic recalled certain MiniMed insulin pumps due to programming issues that could result in the under-delivery of insulin.Then, in November 2022, the FDA warned that, due to the wireless features of the MiniMed, the devices could potentially be taken over by a hacker. In order for such a breach to occur, a person would need to be physically near the pump and access it during wireless pairing with other system components. Medtronic said that the pumps cannot be taken over via the Internet.While many of the devices offered by Medtronics competitors have their own fair share of issues and may lack some of the features that have made the MiniMed popular, it s still a huge blow to the company's reputation to have so many issues with one of its products in such a short timeframe.In August 2022, Medtronic also issued a recall for its Cobalt XT, Cobalt and Crome ICDs and CRT-Ds due to the risk that the devices may issue a short circuit alert and deliver reduced energy shock during high voltage therapy. A reduced energy shock may fail to correct an arrythmia or cause an irregular heartbeat, both of which are potentially deadly.While most of Medtronics product recalls have been fixable via software updates or component replacements, a higher-than-usual pace of recalls could signal that the company may be falling behind on the research and development front. This could allow competitors to overtake Medtronic.Management troublesIn the eyes of some long-term investors and employees, part of the blame for Medtronics issues could lie with bad management.Looking through employee reviews on Indeed and Glassdoor, one of the most common complaints both current and former employees level against Medtronic is bad management. Apparently, leadership has a high turnover rate as the top brass is content to hire new, relatively inexperienced leaders rather than raise pay for existing employees.Additionally, as the company had previously fallen behind on its quotas due to supply chain issues, it is now requiring mandatory overtime in order to make up for it, further exacerbating employee turnover. The pay is so low that employees often need to have two or more jobs in order to make ends meet, so mandatory overtime is a no-go as it may cut into other jobs.Moving on to the upper management, CEO Geoff Martha says he regrets not moving faster to take advantage of acquisition opportunities during the initial Covid-driven market selloff, which reflects a common complaint from the companys investors.In fact, not only did upper management fail to take advantage of M&amp;A deals in early 2020, it is even planning to spin off some parts of its business. In October 2022, the company announced its plans to separate its Patient Monitoring and Respiratory Interventions businesses, estimating that the move should be completed within 12 to 18 months at the time.Some might say this is an unwise move because it could chip away at Medtronics status as the worlds largest medical device company, a position that comes with unique scale advantages. Martha took the helm in early 2020 just as the Covid-19 pandemic hit, so it is possible that he is too stuck on downsizing and restructuring to pinch pennies.However, Medtronics size can also be a drag on results due to an overly complex bureaucracy. The planned spinoff, which represented 7% of Medtronics revenues for the last fiscal year, could help narrow the companys focus, improve its management structure and unlock value for Medtronics and the new companys stocks.Valuation and dividendWhile Medtronics forward price-earnings ratio may look appealing, its earnings per share have traded in a range since 2013, not showing meaningful growth. A stagnant company will always be worth a lower valuation than a growing company.Medtronic: Can This Medical Device Maker Turn Itself Around?The GF Value chart rates the stock as modestly undervalued based on past growth, historical earnings multiples and analysts estimates of future results.Medtronic: Can This Medical Device Maker Turn Itself Around?On the other hand, the GuruFocus reverse discounted cash flow calculator estimates the company would need to grow its earnings per share by about 15.26% per year for the next decade in order to be worth its current valuation, which is miles above its historical 10-year earnings per share growth rate of 0.80%.One positive is that the stock does have a forward dividend yield of 3.36%, which is better than 76% of industry peers. Medtronic is also a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its dividend for 45 years in a row.TakeawayMedtronic may look cheap on paper, but when we take the companys stagnating growth into consideration, it may be closer to fairly valued or even overvalued territory. The recalls of the past few years point to the possibility of falling behind on the R&amp;D front, and the company is big enough that its management structure has become too clunky for focused operations.Can Medtronic turn itself around? I think its best hope to do so is to continue pursuing its restructuring strategy, which includes spinoffs, so that parts of its business can focus on their areas of expertise without being weighed down by the extensive corporate ladder. Additionally, smaller spinoffs will have the potential to grow at a faster pace, though investors looking for a solid dividend may still find the legacy company more to their liking.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 1.17% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.02%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.45%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the medical device company had gained 5.28% over the past month. This has outpaced the Medical sector's gain of 0.26% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.25% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Medtronic as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Medtronic to post earnings of $1.26 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 8.03%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.5 billion, down 3.37% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.26 per share and revenue of $30.42 billion, which would represent changes of -5.23% and -3.98%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Medtronic should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% lower. Medtronic is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Investors should also note Medtronic's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 15.39. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.51.Story continuesWe can also see that MDT currently has a PEG ratio of 2.53. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Medical - Products stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.26 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Medical - Products industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 154, which puts it in the bottom 39% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

141,2991d2b0-27ee-3074-9648-b958ce6ffea3,GT,2023-01-06,Goodyear CEO explains venture into sustainable tires,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/goodyear-ceo-explains-companies-venture-234323538.html,1672962203,VIDEO,['GT'],"[Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi discusses Goodyear's push into sustainable tires with The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company CEO Rich Kramer.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: All right. Joining me now is Goodyear chairman and CEO Rich Kramer. Rich, always good to see you. You're not coming to us from the blimp, right? Just be sure.RICH KRAMER: I wish I was, but I'm coming to you from CES.BRIAN SOZZI: OK. All right. You're at CES, and you're bringing some really interesting technology. I can't say, I'm surprised. I know you're always working on some cool things a Goodyear. The sustainable tire, what is this?RICH KRAMER: So Brian, you're right. And it's great to be with you, by the way. We did. We have two announcements here, one being a tire made out of 90% sustainable materials. And this is something we're really proud of relative to our goal of getting to zero greenhouse gas emissions down the road and helping the industry.You know, Brian, what you know from the last time we talked we had a tire at 70% sustainable materials. Now, we're at 90% and we're proud of this. What we continue to do is really focus on taking more petro chems out of the tire, replacing them with biomaterials and other materials that will allow us to recycle the tire more. And we're doing that not giving up any performance and, in particular, around rolling resistance, which gives you better fuel mileage, whether you're in an ICE vehicle or you're getting range out of an EV vehicle.So more sustainable, no takeaway of performance. And we're the first company to get to that 90% level.BRIAN SOZZI: All right. So two ingredients-- I'll call them ingredients. I don't know what else to call them, Rich. I'll call two ingredients that stood out to me on this tire. You're using soybean oil and rice husk waste. Why those two elements in the tire? And you mean to tell me there a tire will not wear out faster because you're using those products?RICH KRAMER: Well, you know, Brian, you're exactly correct. So, so those two materials-- really, really got to give credit to the team for coming up with this. One, both of those actually don't degrade performance at all. They actually increase it. In fact, as we look at soybean oil, it makes the tire more pliable in cold conditions, that gives it more grip.Story continuesAnd on rice husk ash, we use it as a place of petro-based silica. And what that does for us is actually improves rolling resistance on the tread. So this is a way of actually moving to those bio-based materials that I said and not giving up any performance and, in fact, in many cases, enhancing performance.BRIAN SOZZI: Why is a product like this so important to a company like Goodyear and its future?RICH KRAMER: Well, for us, I think, number one, it's the right thing to do as we think about the sustainability goals that we and our customers have. Secondly, it's what our customers are asking for. As you well know, we have scope one, scope two, scope three goals that we have to achieve. And bringing a sustainable tire to our customers helps them achieve those. That's really important to us.And then when we add features like intelligence to it and our service proposition, we can bring a whole different set of solutions to customers, as we think about the mobility trends that we see going forward around fleets, autonomous connected, and electric vehicles.BRIAN SOZZI: How difficult is it to scale a product like this up?RICH KRAMER: So Brian, it's actually a great question. And it is harder to scale because we're talking about a whole new complement of materials coming in, which means having to build a supply chain to be able to do that. And it's why having the right partners to collaborate with to get us those materials is so important. We're on the front end of that. But this is something that's going to continue to evolve.But Brian, I want to tell you, this is not something that's just an idea that we have. While the 90% material is a demonstration tire, which, by the way, passes all department of transportation requirements, the 70% tire, the tire made out of 70% sustainable materials, you can actually go on our website and buy right now. So we're trying to bring this to life even as that supply chain matures to make sure that we're not just putting prototypes out but actually bringing this to market.BRIAN SOZZI: When will I be able to-- when will I be able to see a 100% sustainable tire from a Goodyear? And what would be in that tire that's not in this one?RICH KRAMER: So our goal is, by 2030, to have a tire made out of 100% sustainable materials. Again, I'm going to give hats off to my team for their ingenuity, for their tenacity to get us to 90% today. And I'll certainly Thank the collaboration we've had with our suppliers.I would tell you that other 10% is going to come from, again, replacing certain of the materials that we have to make sure we can get the performance we want. And it's ultimately going to rely on the collaborations with some of our partners to come up with some of the inventions that we need to replace that last 10%. But I'm confident that we're going to get there. I'm 100% sure we're going to get there.BRIAN SOZZI: I-- we focus a lot on jobs and reskilling the workforce at Yahoo Finance, Rich. And this seems like a real opportunity to upskill a lot of your workers. Would you agree with that?RICH KRAMER: I would agree with that. And I would say, not only upskill, but I would say what we've seen is real purpose to those working on projects like this. So instead of just getting a tire, giving us a new size or maybe a different tire one of our customer might ask for, this is really working on a social problem and environmental problem that we have. So not only upskilling but giving our associates perfect purpose to solve a bigger problem is something that we've seen. The excitement internally is palpable.BRIAN SOZZI: One big problem for manufacturers continues to be is inflation, Rich. Have you seen any peak in your business, any slowing growth rates, and anything that goes into a tire at this point?RICH KRAMER: Well, I would tell you, as you well know, the markets, particularly in Europe, are still giving us a lot of headwinds. The markets have been down as we went into the last months of the year. And we've still seen those high costs around some transportation, around labor, and around energy, certainly in Europe.But I would also say we're starting to see some of those raw material costs roll over. So as we get into the first half of 2023, we'll still see some of those headwinds coming. But Brian, I would tell you, as we look to the second half and as we look to some of those costs rolling over and we look to the economy perhaps picking up some more steam back then, we're pretty confident about the second half of the year.BRIAN SOZZI: One of my friends, Rich, knew I was coming to talk to you, and they recently had a blowout in the tire. It wasn't a good year. So that's a good thing. But they spent four hours to get one tire. I mean, the pricing has gone up a lot. And the economy continues to slow. Do you see consumers balking a little bit, maybe pushing it to the limit on what tires-- you know, how far they should even have these tires left on the cars, given their financial standings and the pricing of some of these products?RICH KRAMER: Well, Brian, I would tell you two things. You know, one of the things is that, given the retail outlets that we have and our partners out there, we look very closely at treadwear as we take tires off, as they get replaced. And I would tell you, we're not seeing treadwear going down to levels beyond what is normal. And that tells me that consumers are still in the mode of changing tires at a normal cycle. That's a really good thing.And yes, tire pricing has gone up. But that's also because, as we said earlier, those input costs have gone up so dramatically. And the way that we deal with that, and I'll go back to one of the reasons that-- one of the benefits that we got from doing the Cooper Tire acquisition, is we have a whole lineup of tires at different price points for different segments that allow the consumer to meet the needs that they have. And I think that's actually one of the benefits that we got from that deal as well.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you still-- do you think you have the opportunity to push through some more price here?RICH KRAMER: You know, I think as we look at what our input costs are, it's something that we have to do and it's something that we'll continue to consider. So yes, I do think it's something that we're paying very close attention to.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, let's leave it there. Rich Kramer, Goodyear Tire chairman and CEO, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Enjoy the rest of the CES.RICH KRAMER: Thank you, Brian. Take care.]"

When clinical trial volunteers are diverse, these studies can show if the treatments are safe and work well for people from all different communities. They also help researchers better understand patterns of difference in health and illness based on different backgrounds.What is Merck doing to increase access and inclusion in clinical trials?Over the last five years, Merck has worked to help historically underrepresented communities access its clinical trials. For example, the company:Implemented a new process that requires diversity plans (actionable steps) across all late-stage clinical trials.Prioritized selection of U.S. sites in diverse communities by using census data.Developed various partnerships with community organizations, colleges and universities, and professional organizations to expand outreach to people from different genders, races, ethnicities and sexual orientations.Invested in training and tools for researchers, its teams, clinicians and others at clinical trial sites to address the need for broader clinical trial access.Story continuesMerck's approach is working. In 2022, approximately 50% of its clinical trial patients were from diverse backgrounds - both in the U.S. and globally.But Merck feels there is more that can be done. The company's diversity &amp; inclusion in clinical trials team is focused on increasing access to clinical trials in the U.S. and will expand those efforts globally.""With the bigger team and the support of many people across our company who are passionate about this work, we're making important progress. We'll also be able to drive new health innovations and help overcome serious health care challenges - for everyone.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Merck &amp; Co., Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/merck-co-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/734131/How-Merck-Is-Prioritizing-Diversity-in-Clinical-Trials-and-Why-Its-So-Important]"

MOS.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes as We Step into 2023The stock market remains volatile at the beginning of 2023.  The S&amp;P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq have yielded negative returns of 17.95%, 8.19% and 30.65%, respectively, over the past year period. The bearish sentiment dominates the stock markets and the economy is expected to run into recession.Inflation in the United States continues to remain the biggest challenge for the economy. The Fed hinted that it would slow down the pace of the interest rate rise with more evidence of easing inflation. However, it continues to support increasing interest rates in 2023.  The consumer price index (CPI) for November 2022 came in at 7.1% after record highs of 8.2% in September and 8.3% in August. Yet, the numbers are far from the Federal Reserve’s ambitious target of 2% for a strong economy.The November Job Opening and Labor Turnover report shows signs of continued strength in the labor market irrespective of the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) data, which indicates a contraction in the manufacturing index. This signals that the increasing interest rate is slowing down the economy, which could lead to a recession.The global economy shows signs of slowing down due to a high inflation situation in many countries and the energy crisis due to geopolitical tensions. High energy costs due to the ongoing war in Ukraine have aggravated one of the worst energy crises in recent decades, causing a global supply-chain disturbance.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Rockwell Automation's (NYSE:ROK) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Rockwell Automation:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$11b - US$3.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Rockwell Automation has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Electrical industry average of 10% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Rockwell Automation compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Rockwell Automation's ROCE Trend?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 19% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 43% in that time. Since 19% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayThe main thing to remember is that Rockwell Automation has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. However, over the last five years, the stock has only delivered a 39% return to shareholders who held over that period. So to determine if Rockwell Automation is a multi-bagger going forward, we'd suggest digging deeper into the company's other fundamentals.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Rockwell Automation   you'll probably want to know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $19.05 billion, up 28.75% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Boeing should also be noted by investors.

To include Womack as a part of corporate governance, the board increased its size from 13 to 14 members.Womack, 64, will operate an energy powerhouse that produced $22.4 billion in annual revenue in 2021; employs 27,300 workers, and serves roughly 9 million customers through its subsidiaries.Among the top innovators in the sector, the company provides “clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy” through electric operating companies in three states, natural gas distribution companies in four states, a fiber optics network and telecommunications services, among other entities.The announcement represents a corporate milestone.“It’s a great opportunity to bring honor to lead this wonderful company that provides an incredible service and being able to work with an incredible team address all the challenges that face the energy industry and bring Southern Company to the future,” Womack said in an exclusive interview with BLACK ENTERPRISE. “It’s a continued commitment to staying focused on providing clean, safe and reliable energy all of our customers and taking advantage of technological opportunities. I want to make sure that we stay focused providing our customers with the power services that they need now and in the future.”He adds: “Our commitment to diversity and equity will continue. We will continue to focus on growing diverse talent within our organization and providing opportunities at every level. It is not a short-term episodic adventure. It is a long-term journey with a commitment to staying the course.”Story continuesIn recent years, the number of Black CEOs of major companies has dwindled. When Womack takes the helm of Southern later this year, he will join the ranks of six other Black chief executives to achieve that status: Marvin Ellison of Lowe’s, Rosalind Brewer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Rene Jones of M&amp;T Bank, Thasunda Brown Duckett of TIAA, David Rawlinson of Qurate Retail, parent company of QVC and HSN, and Calvin Butler, who was recently installed as the president and CEO of Exelon Utilities.He continued, “My appointment demonstrates that there is opportunity for everyone and that there are no limits. No one should be limited by color or gender to lead and achieve their ultimate desires and carry out their professional capabilities.David J. Grain, Southern’s lead independent director, maintained that Womack was selected as a result of his outstanding track record and intimate knowledge of all aspects of the company and energy sector. Another major contributor: The board’s focused, intentional process to identify the next top executive to lead the company into the future.“The Board has been actively engaged in succession planning for the past several years, and after consideration of a number of candidates, we unanimously selected Chris as our new chief executive officer and president. Chris’ proven leadership, alignment with our values, and ability to deliver strong results makes him a terrific choice to lead Southern Company,” Grain, CEO of Grain Management, LLC, one of the few Black lead directors of a corporate board of a major corporation, said in a statement.Thomas A, Fanning, the current chairman, CEO, and president who will become the board’s executive chairman after Womack fully assumes his new positions, maintained that he serves as a perfect successor.“Chris’ leadership, vision, and integrity during his career with Southern Company have uniquely prepared him to guide Southern Company into a new era,” said Fanning. “With our recent progress at Plant Vogtle and continued conversion of our operations toward net zero emissions, I believe that now is an ideal time to transition to new leadership. I have confidence that Chris will continue our progress and deliver on Southern Company’s commitment to providing clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy and customized solutions to customers across the United States. I look forward to working closely with Chris over the next five months as he assumes this new role and to focusing on an effective transition in my new position as executive chairman of the board of directors.”A perennial on BLACK ENTERPRISE‘s rosters of Most Powerful Black Executives in Corporate America, Womack currently serves as chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power—a position he assumed in 2021. He was named Georgia Power’s president in 2020 after a lengthy tenure at Southern.A native of Greenville, Alabama, he joined Southern in 1988 and has held several leadership positions during his tenure, everything from executive vice president and president of external affairs to senior vice president of human resources and chief people officer. Prior to joining the company, Womack served as a legislative aide for former Congressman Leon E. Panetta and as staff director for the Subcommittee on Personnel and Police for the Committee on House Administration.He also holds a bachelor’s degree from Western Michigan University and a master’s degree from The American University. He completed the Stanford Executive Program in 2001 and is currently pursuing his doctorate degree in political science at Clark Atlanta University.]"

CI intends to achieve 10-13% average annual adjusted earnings per share growth on a long-term basis.Solid specialty pharmacy services continue to drive the growth of the Evernorth platform. Thereby, Cigna’s December 2022 announcement to include biosimilars as preferred products within its commercial formularies from 2023 seems a prudent move in order to upgrade the pharmacy products suite.Meanwhile, the Cigna Healthcare segment is aided by growing premiums resulting from an extensive customer base within its U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government businesses. An aging U.S. population is expected to sustain solid demand for Cigna’s Medicare plans, which fall under its U.S. Government business. In addition to a solid premium base, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits on the back of continuous product expansions and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems. As of Sep 30, 2022, total medical customers of CI rose 5.6% year over year.Story continuesSuch promising prospects of the two growth platforms propelled Cigna to divest non-health units and intensify focus on the core units. The proceeds received from the sell-offs were tactically utilized by CI to bring down the mounting debt burden and continually engage in share repurchases.Cigna also boasts a solid financial standing, substantiated by growing cash reserves and robust cash-generating abilities.

Canadian Imperial plans to appeal the New York judge’s order.Canadian Imperial mentioned that it expects to witness a C$1.16-billion pretax charge or C$850 million ($631 million) after taxes in its first-quarter results, which will reduce its ratio of capital to assets.The dispute between Cerberus and Canadian Imperial rose from a complex 2008 structured note transaction, in which CM received a $571-million loan intended to reduce its U.S. residential real estate exposure in exchange for payments to a Cerberus entity.In November 2015, Cerberus sued Canadian Imperial, claiming that it underpaid some amounts it owed, and stopped making some payments altogether after a group of credit default swaps went into default and the underlying bonds were liquidated.Canadian Imperial said that Cerberus misread the underlying agreements and had been accepting the alleged underpayments for several years.However, in December, after a non-jury trial, Justice Joel Cohen of a New York state court in Manhattan found that CM was liable for breach of contract and, hence, he rejected CM’s counterclaims, which included that Cerberus acted with fraudulent intent.Hence, Yesterday, Cerberus said that “ample evidence” supported Cohen's findings, and it expected his decisions would be “fully upheld” in an appeal.Over the past six months, shares of CM have lost 13.2% against an 8.1% increase recorded by the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Canadian Imperial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per the lawsuit, CACC allegedly lured thousands of low-income individuals into unaffordable high-interest car loans.The complaint claims that the sub-prime auto lender deceived customers by not properly stating the key terms on loan agreements, including the principal and interest amounts. Also, it failed to disclose thousands of dollars in credit charges.The CFPB director, Rohit Chopra, stated, “Credit Acceptance obscured the true cost of its loans,” subjecting car buyers to severe financial distress and aggressive debt collection “on loans its own systems predicted that borrowers can't afford to repay.”Per the regulators, Credit Acceptance “sets consumers up to fail” by charging exorbitant interest rates that average around 22%, and entering arrangements with dealers that mask the true cost of borrowing and sometimes violate state usury laws.CACC has been asked to fix the abusive loans, offer restitution and pay civil penalties of at least $1 million per day for violating federal consumer protection laws.Notably, the lawsuit covers the period between November 2015 and April 2021, when an estimated 1.9 million consumers borrowed from Credit Acceptance.CACC said it “operates with integrity and believes it has complied with applicable laws and regulations.”The company also said that it believes that the complaint does not have any merit and that it intends to defend itself in the matter.Over the past six months, shares of CACC have lost 18.9% compared with a decline of 8.4% recorded by the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Credit Acceptance carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Given the prevailing economic conditions, a market-neutral fund is particularly relevant for protecting one’s invested capital. This type of fund is designed to provide stable returns at relatively lower levels of risk regardless of market direction.Market-neutral funds aim to adopt a precision approach by shorting 50% of their assets and holding 50% long. This method seeks to identify pairs of assets whose price movements are related. The fund goes long on the outperforming asset and shorts the underperformer.Say, for instance, you take a $1 million long position in Pfizer and a $1 million short position in Wyeth, both large pharmaceutical companies. If pharmaceutical stocks fall, you will lose because of your long position in Pfizer but gain from your short position in Wyeth.Below, we share with you three top-ranked market-neutral funds, viz.,Touchstone Credit Opportunities Fund TMAYX, BlackRock Event Driven Equity Fund Investor A Shares BALPX and Hussman Strategic Growth Fd HSGFX.

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA on the 20vPnC vaccine application is anticipated in April 2023. The FDA previously granted Pfizer’s 20vPnC Fast Track Designation in May 2017 and Breakthrough Therapy Designation in August 2020 for the pediatric indication for IPD.""Today’s regulatory milestone further advances Pfizer’s commitment to the more than 20-year legacy of helping protect infants and children from invasive pneumococcal disease through conjugate vaccination,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. ""By offering the broadest serotype coverage by a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against important serotypes causing pneumococcal disease in U.S. infants and children, 20vPnc, if approved, can help expand the protection for this vulnerable pediatric population.""The regulatory submission is supported by results from the Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trial programs for the pediatric indication for 20vPnC. Three core Phase 3 pediatric studies contributed to data on the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 20vPnC, including previously announced positive, top-line results of the pivotal U.S. Phase 3 study (NCT04382326). These studies collectively enrolled approximately 3,500 infants and 800 children of all ages.

(PFE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-trending-stock-140002785.html,1672927202,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share, indicating a change of +0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -26.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +46.2%. This estimate has changed -3.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 indicates a change of -27.6% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.13 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $100.17 billion and $75.51 billion estimates indicate +22.9% and -24.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $22.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $1.78 for the same period compares with $1.34 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.61%. The EPS surprise was +21.09%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.17% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.02%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.45%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the technology platform and digital payments company had gained 4.39% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 8.27% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.25% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Paypal as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Paypal to post earnings of $1.19 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 7.21%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $7.39 billion, up 6.85% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Paypal. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.29% higher. Paypal currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Paypal has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.23 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 41.93, so we one might conclude that Paypal is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that PYPL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.03. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Software was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.83 at yesterday's closing price.The Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 68, putting it in the top 27% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

183,bdd07ac9-5a9f-39de-8f7e-ce489210c22a,IBM,2023-01-06,Upskilling Austin’s Vibrant Workforce for the In-Demand Jobs of Tomorrow,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upskilling-austin-vibrant-workforce-demand-205000082.html,1672951800,STORY,['IBM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / January 5, 2023 / IBMOriginally published by Austin ChamberAustin's job market growth is outpacing the rest of the U.S. According to Workforce Solutions Capital Area, 172,194 new jobs were added to the Austin-Round Rock-Georgetown metro area between 2016 and 2021, representing a 16.0% job growth increase and far surpassing the U.S.'s 1.8% increase during the same period. In the five-year period from 2021 to 2026, our region is forecasted to grow an additional 12.5%, nearly three times more than what the U.S. is expected to grow.Failing to meet this demand for qualified local candidates could hinder our region's continued development. All employers worldwide are having difficulty finding skilled workers to fit their needs for the in-demand digital jobs of tomorrow. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), in 2021 alone, the number of available jobs in the technology sector nearly doubled; however, the pool of available applicants shrank by nearly 25%. As a result, the WEF says companies estimate that 50% of all employees will need reskilling. Closing this digital skills gap could add $11.5 trillion to global GDP by 2028. This skills gap poses a hurdle to global economic growth, and inevitably, growth in Austin as well.One way to close the skills gap is by prioritizing education and training initiatives that reflect the evolving demands of labor markets that are frequently challenged by technological disruption. However, today, there is no system in place that encourages job applicants and employers to validate credentials earned outside traditional academic institutions, making it difficult for companies to weigh credentials equally with degrees. As a result, many qualified candidates are often overlooked. We need a modernized system where learners' credentials are verifiable and adopt frameworks that would make them valued by employers.Skills-building, like innovation, is a team sport. As companies scramble to hire qualified employees, particularly from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, IBM and its partners are investing in the future of work. Here's how: to help close this gap, we have adopted an ecosystem approach that helps solve the credentials dilemma and create a more diverse pipeline of candidates for technology-related jobs. We created a clear ecosystem roadmap with academic and industry partnerships and are leveraging existing programs and career-building platforms. Our inclusive skills-first approach helps reduce systemic issues and makes the learning-to-earning journey more attainable for underrepresented communities.Story continuesSolving the Credentials DilemmaIn October 2021, IBM announced its commitment to skill 30 million people globally by 2030 to create equitable and economic opportunities while also addressing a STEM job skills shortage impacting the business community. IBM has also reduced the percentage of U.S. job postings that require a four-year degree to 50%, resulting in more inclusive opportunities and a more diverse range of candidates. This is particularly critical in Texas where 54% of jobs require skills training beyond high school but not necessarily a four-year degree, according to the National Skills Coalition.A major component of IBM's skills-first approach is delivered through our education program, IBM SkillsBuild, offering access to more than 1,000 online, self-paced courses in 19 languages. Learners can gain knowledge of crucial professional workplace skills like design thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving, in addition to learning about technical disciplines, such as data analytics, cybersecurity, and cloud computing - all free of cost. Participants can earn IBM-branded digital credentials to certify their newly attained skills, and a global network of partners, including some here, in Austin, help connect these learners with local job opportunities.Mobilizing the Austin EcosystemIBM's efforts mobilize the private sector across the globe to expand opportunities for underrepresented and historically disadvantaged communities. Some examples in the Austin region include:Workforce Solutions Capital Area, which for decades has connected local job seekers to local in-demand jobs, recently announced it received a grant to launch a pilot and implement IBM SkillsBuild as a resource to open access to training programs that are typically not financially accessible to low-income residents.In November, Transition Overwatch announced the launch of its Unconventional Apprenticeship Program to help military members transition from active-duty service members into new-collar careers by providing them access to IBM SkillsBuild. Transition Overwatch is launching the initiative in four regional hubs, including Austin, and is a military-supporting training provider for Workforce Solutions Capital Area.Over the summer, IBM teamed up with The University of Texas Women in STEM (WiSTEM) program to help close the gender gap in STEM and create an inspired and diverse community of confident leaders. IBM Austin hosted a WiSTEM Summer Externship with 591 students participating in the program and earning 884 credential badges with over 4,264 hours of learning completed. As a result, an overwhelming 92% of participants said they feel confident they can overcome any setbacks they may face in the STEM field.Inclusivity FoundationAdditionally, recently IBM announced its collaboration with the Hispanic Heritage Foundation to help Hispanic learners gain the much-needed skills for career opportunities in STEM jobs. While Hispanics are one of the fastest-growing populations in the U.S., they make up 17% of the U.S. workforce and only represent 8% of those working in STEM. In May, IBM announced initiatives with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Specialisterne Foundation, and six HBCUs to provide no-cost STEM job training to U.S. military veterans, neurodivergent learners worldwide, and university students from underrepresented communities in the U.S.All these initiatives are aimed at successfully upskilling, reskilling, and best preparing today's workforce for the future of work. The credentials dilemma will not be easy to solve, but we can do this by creating stronger partnerships locally, and nationally, and continuing to build a robust system to validate credentials and hire qualified candidates for the jobs they deserve.Let's continue to work together to close the STEM job skills gap. It is up to us to leverage our networks in the Austin business community to help build ecosystems that tackle systemic issues while creating more equitable opportunities, and most importantly, appropriately train all job seekers in our region for the in-demand jobs of tomorrow.About the AuthorJason Kelley, General Manager, IBM Global Strategic Partners, is responsible for the strategy, organization and business performance of IBM strategic alliances.

If you want to see more of the top HR companies in the world, go directly to Top 5 HR Companies in the World.A company's employee base is very important. With the right employees, a company can be more productive and produce more goods and services. It can potentially have higher growth, higher margin, and higher value.Given that projects for companies change all the time as the market develops, not every company has the necessary expertise among its employee base all the time. Sometimes companies need outside talent to temporarily help with a project. Sometimes a company's management lacks the necessary expertise to fully evaluate an opportunity when entering a new market or when taking on a new project.As a result, companies often seek human resources companies to help them find the necessary talent they need.Consulting CompaniesWhen it comes to human resources companies, many large corporations turn to consulting companies to help them find the necessary expertise.In terms of management consulting, some consultants provide management information such as through feasibility studies, market surveys and analysis of an industry. Sometimes consultants also help management determine whether they should acquire or divest a business, restrucuture, or whether the company should change a marketing strategy.Some human resources companies also offer employee staffing as well in addition to management consulting.Companies like Accenture, for example, offer ""innovative and comprehensive services and solutions that span cloud; systems integration and application management; security; intelligent platform services; infrastructure services; software engineering services; data and artificial intelligence; and global delivery through our Advanced Technology Centers."" Accenture also has an operations business that ""operates business processes on behalf of clients for specific enterprise functions, including finance and accounting, sourcing and procurement, supply chain, marketing and sales, as well as industry-specific services, such as platform trust and safety, banking, insurance and health services.""Story continuesGrowthGiven the growth in the global economy and also the need for companies to be as competitive and flexible as possible to potentially take advantage of value creating opportunities, the top HR companies have grown substantially over the last three decades. Boston Consulting Group, for example, has tripled sales over the last decade with the majority of the growth being organic.As a result, some of the biggest HR companies have tens of billions in annual revenue and hundreds of thousands of employees.Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially over the past year and many analysts think the U.S. central bank will raise rates further.As a result of the higher interest rates, aggregate demand has decreased and many economists think there could be a recession in 2023. Given the headwinds, some HR companies may not be as in demand as they used to be in the near term. In the long term, however, there will likely still be substantial demand.For those of you interested, check out 15 Countries with Lowest Interest Rates.The Largest HR CompaniesIn terms of the largest HR companies, many of the world's biggest consulting companies are privately owned by their senior partners and employees.One reason for the large concentration of private ownership in the industry could be that consulting companies traditionally do not need much capital to start off since consulting is more about the consultants and their expertise rather than about physical assets that need large up front investments to build. Growing consulting businesses also do not require as much capital if done correctly.As a result of the less up front capital needed, the four biggest HR companies in the world are all private.Because consultancies can also sell their clients other services as well, many of the world's top consultancies offer other services such as tax services.george green/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of Top 10 HR Companies in the World, we include the 'big three' consulting firms such as McKinsey &amp; Company, Bain &amp; Company, and Boston Consulting Group.We also include the 'big four' consulting firms, which are known for their scale which include Deloitte, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), and Ernst &amp; Young (EY).Finally, we include publicly listed companies with large market capitalizations that also offer consulting services such as Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH).We ranked each company based on its consulting revenue in 2021.Top 10 HR Companies in the World10. Bain &amp; Company2021 Revenue: UnavailableSince it's a private company, Bain &amp; Company doesn't have to disclose its revenues. As such, the company ranks #10 on our list of Top 10 HR Companies in the World given the uncertainty. While it doesn't disclose its annual sales, it is likely Bain &amp; Company has annual sales in the billions given the consultancy is commonly mentioned along with other firms such as McKinsey &amp; Company and Boston Consulting Group as part of the prestigious 'big three' in the industry.Founded in 1973, Bain &amp; Company has thousands of employees spread across 64 offices in 39 countries to work as a global team to help clients improve their strategy, marketing, organization, operations, information technology, and more. Given its scale, Bain &amp; Company has worked with 63% of the Global 500 which are the largest companies in the world in terms of annual revenue.9. Boston Consulting Group2021 Revenue: $11 billionBoston Consulting Group ranks #9 on our list of Top 10 HR Companies in the World given its 2021 revenue of $11 billion.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 58% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that International Business Machines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see International Business Machines' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. International Business Machines is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.7% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of International Business Machines Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$106m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 42% stake in International Business Machines. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 5 warning signs for International Business Machines (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ford F, General Motors GM and Stellantis STLA, Tesla TSLA and Rivian RIVN.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Contenders of the Electric Truck BattleThe electric vehicle (EV) revolution is transforming the future of mobility. But while electric cars are taking off in a big way with customers spoilt for choices, pickups have been rather slow in shifting gears to electric. Not long ago, there were no electric pickups on the road. But that’s gradually changing. Some of the popular e-pickups that you may get your hands on now include F-150 Lightning Pro, GMC Hummer and R1T.With pickups being the quintessential American vehicles and the ultimate fusion of utility and freedom, auto biggies are realizing the potential of the e-pickup market, which is set to explode in the coming years. Companies like Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, Tesla and Rivian look poised to dominate the e-pickup market in the coming years. The race to be the best electric pickup truck will only get fiercer from here on.Ford Racing Ahead of Its Peers NowFord’s F-series has been the best-selling truck in the United States for more than four decades. And its electric version named, F-150 Lightning Pro, is carrying forward the success, pivoting Ford for a notable transition in the electric space. The all-electric F-150 e-pickup hit the market in spring 2022. After its launch, the 2022 F-150 pickup received a resounding response as the first all-electric version in the F-series.Ford’s e-pickup was named as the 2023 Truck of the Year by the Motor Trend magazine. Ford is actively focusing on scaling up production of the F-150 Lightning at its Rouge complex in Michigan. The company targets annual production of 150,000 e-pickups by 2023 fall.Story continuesAfter the roaring success of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, Ford is working on another electric truck. The second e-truck will be built at Ford’s new Blue Oval City campus in Tennessee. It could be the electric version of its other popular pickup nameplates like Ranger or Maverick. While not much has been revealed about the second e-pickup model, Ford fans expect that something as exciting as F-150 Lightning Pro is in store for them.General Motors is a Name to Reckon WithGMC Hummer EV is the all-electric version of the popular gas guzzler of 2010,launched in the fall of 2020 as part of General Motors’ Everybody In electrification strategy. The first deliveries of Hummer EV pickup began in December 2021 and it was the first model to include next-generation battery cells and a platform known as Ultium.Although Hummer e-truck production at the Factory Zero plant is ramping up, overall output is still considerably limited amid a scarcity of Ultium batteries and Ultium Drive motors. Additionally, the company is prioritizing the scant Ultium battery supply toward electric Cadillac SUV. However, with the planned construction of three more Ultium manufacturing plants, we expect higher production and deliveries of GMC Hummer e-pickup.General Motors is working on two other pickup models — Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra e-trucks. The legacy automaker will commence shipping the Chevrolet Silverado e-pickup in a few months. It will also be manufactured at the Factory Zero plant. The model will boast a mind-boggling 400+ miles of range. Chevy Silverado will be offered in various configurations, from basic workhorse to bling-laden boulevardier. This e-truck will be followed by the GMC Sierra EV pickup — with impressive specifications including 754 horsepower and 400 miles of range —deliveries of which are expected to start in 2024.Stellantis is Set to Catch UpStellantis’ RAM brand is famous for its powerful pickup trucks and it is set to reveal its much-awaited electric version today at CES 2023. This is part of STLA’s ambitious Dare Forward 2030 plan.  The company targets 50% of the passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States and 100% of the passenger car BEV sales mix in Europe by the end of this decade. RAM’s electric truck is named RAM 1500 REV. Although details of the model are under wraps now, RAM 1500 REV is expected to have 300-350 miles of range. The truck is expected to arrive in the markets next year.While that would give its American counterparts, including General Motors and Ford, a headstart of a couple of years, CEO Carlos Tavares doesn’t seem much worried about the same. In fact, he believes that it would give the company a chance to gauge the capabilities of other products in the market and make necessary tweaks. RAM has been getting consumer responses on its e-pickup via its Ram Revolution insider program.Stellantis currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tesla to Finally Deliver After Much DelayEV king Tesla grabbed huge eyeballs when Musk first unveiled Cybertruck in 2019 owing to its outlandish look. With a wedge-like shape, ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless-steel body and armored glass windows, the design of Tesla’s Cybertruck is quite extreme. There will be three models, with the cheapest — priced at $39,900 — having a 7,500-pound towing capacity, a range of 250 miles and a startup speed of 0-60 mph of less than 6.5 seconds.Initially scheduled to hit roads by 2021-end, the timeline of this futuristic pickup has been pushed back many times. But per Musk’s promise on the second-quarter 2022 earnings call, Cybertruck deliveries will finally begin by the middle of this year.Rivian Gradually Losing Its First-Mover AdvantageRivian was the first company to bring an e-pickup to the consumer market, beating other automotive giants. It started deliveries of its all-electric R1T truck in September 2021. But this first entrant in the e-pickup market has been struggling to some extent to produce vehicles without being affected by quality issues. The ongoing parts shortage is already impeding deliveries and recalls further add to the woes.In full-year 2022, Rivian produced 24,337 vehicles, falling short of its target of 25,000 units amid severe supply chain disruptions. The company delivered 20,332 vehicles in 2022. Most likely, R1T is Rivian’s top-selling model, and even if this EV startup is battling manufacturing hurdles, there’s no denying that it is still one of the noted names in the electric truck market currently.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Ford’s e-pickup was named as the 2023 Truck of the Year by the Motor Trend magazine. Ford is actively focusing on scaling up production of the F-150 Lightning at its Rouge complex in Michigan. The company targets annual production of 150,000 e-pickups by 2023 fall.After the roaring success of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, Ford is working on another electric truck. The second e-truck will be built at Ford’s new Blue Oval City campus in Tennessee. It could be the electric version of its other popular pickup nameplates like Ranger or Maverick. While not much has been revealed about the second e-pickup model, Ford fans expect that something as exciting as F-150 Lightning Pro is in store for them.Story continuesGeneral Motors is a Name to Reckon WithGMC Hummer EV is the all-electric version of the popular gas guzzler of 2010,launched in the fall of 2020 as part of General Motors’ Everybody In electrification strategy. The first deliveries of Hummer EV pickup began in December 2021 and it was the first model to include next-generation battery cells and a platform known as Ultium.Although Hummer e-truck production at the Factory Zero plant is ramping up, overall output is still considerably limited amid a scarcity of Ultium batteries and Ultium Drive motors. Additionally, the company is prioritizing the scant Ultium battery supply toward electric Cadillac SUV. However, with the planned construction of three more Ultium manufacturing plants, we expect higher production and deliveries of GMC Hummer e-pickup.General Motors is working on two other pickup models — Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra e-trucks. The legacy automaker will commence shipping the Chevrolet Silverado e-pickup in a few months. It will also be manufactured at the Factory Zero plant. The model will boast a mind-boggling 400+ miles of range. Chevy Silverado will be offered in various configurations, from basic workhorse to bling-laden boulevardier. This e-truck will be followed by the GMC Sierra EV pickup — with impressive specifications including 754 horsepower and 400 miles of range —deliveries of which are expected to start in 2024.Stellantis is Set to Catch UpStellantis’ RAM brand is famous for its powerful pickup trucks and it is set to reveal its much-awaited electric version today at CES 2023. This is part of STLA’s ambitious Dare Forward 2030 plan.  The company targets 50% of passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States and 100% of passenger car BEV sales mix in Europe by the end of this decade. RAM’s electric truck is named RAM 1500 REV. Although details of the model are under wraps now, RAM 1500 REV is expected to have 300-350 miles of range. The truck is expected to arrive in the markets next year.While that would give its American counterparts, including General Motors and Ford, a headstart of a couple of years, CEO Carlos Tavares doesn’t seem much worried about the same. In fact, he believes that it would give the company a chance to gauge the capabilities of other products in the market and make necessary tweaks. RAM has been getting consumer responses on its e-pickup via its Ram Revolution insider program.Stellantis currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tesla to Finally Deliver After Much DelayEV king Tesla grabbed huge eyeballs when Musk first unveiled Cybertruck in 2019 owing to its outlandish look. With a wedge-like shape, ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless-steel body and armored glass windows, the design of Tesla’s Cybertruck is quite extreme. There will be three models, with the cheapest — priced at $39,900 — having a 7,500-pound towing capacity, a range of 250 miles and a startup speed of 0-60 mph of less than 6.5 seconds. Initially scheduled to hit the roads by 2021-end, the timeline of this futuristic pickup has been pushed back many times. But per Musk’s promise on the second-quarter 2022 earnings call, Cybertruck deliveries will finally begin by the middle of this year.Rivian Gradually Losing Its First-Mover AdvantageRivian was the first company to bring an e-pickup to the consumer market, beating other automotive giants. It started deliveries of its all-electric R1T truck in September 2021. But this first entrant in the e-pickup market has been struggling to some extent to produce vehicles without being affected by quality issues. The ongoing parts shortage is already impeding deliveries and recalls further add to the woes. In full-year 2022, Rivian produced 24,337 vehicles, falling short of its target of 25,000 units amid severe supply chain disruptions. The company delivered 20,332 vehicles in 2022. Most likely, R1T is Rivian’s top-selling model, and even if this EV startup is battling manufacturing hurdles, there’s no denying that it is still one of the noted names in the electric truck market currently.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. United Airlines (UAL) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.23 a share, just 13 days from its upcoming earnings release on January 18, 2023.United Airlines' Earnings ESP sits at 4.59%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13.UAL is part of a big group of Transportation stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Delta Air Lines (DAL) as well.Slated to report earnings on January 13, 2023, Delta Air Lines holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.34 a share eight days from its next quarterly update.For Delta Air Lines, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 is 5.65%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, UAL and DAL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Target, like many others, failed to adapt to quickly changing consumer shopping patterns that caused it to suffer a rough 2022, full of inventory issues, lagging sales, and more.Target’s earnings outlook has continued to plummet for FY22, FY23, and FY24, with TGT shares tumbling alongside its fading EPS estimates. Although Target’s long-term outlook like remains intact, now might not be the best time to dive back into TGT, especially with the U.S. economy in the midst of a downturn.Not Pandemic Shoppers AnymoreInvestors first hammered Target stock after its Q1 FY22 earnings release for TGT’s inability to navigate rising freight costs and more. Alongside its bottom-line miss, Wall Street also hated Target’s initial decision to absorb higher costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Walmart WMT got hit hard for a similar report at the time.  Target got stuck dealing with inventory issues because the firm simply had too much of the wrong stuff on hand. Consumers spent well over a year buying all of the furniture, appliances, TVs, and other big-ticket items that they needed.Target was forced to discount items and take other measures to offload its access inventory. Fast forward to TGT’s third quarter release in November, and Wall Street got more bad news. TGT lowered its guidance once again as consumers continued to pull back on spending.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTarget is continuing to offer discounts in an effort to attract shoppers to discretionary items. “We know they are spending more dollars on food and beverage and household essentials, and as they are shopping for discretionary categories they are looking for promotions,” CEO Brian Cornell said on TGT’s Q3 earnings call.The inflationary crunch on shoppers is hitting Target harder than rival Walmart because TGT’s business is made up more heavily of these discretionary items that people have cut out of their budgets.Story continuesTGT’s consensus earnings estimate for FY22 is down 32% since its Q3 release alone and way more since the start of 2022. Plus, its outlook for fiscal 2023 is now 21% lower, with FY24 trending heavily in the wrong direction as well.Bottom LineTarget’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. And Zacks estimates call for its adjusted earnings to fall 59% YoY in fiscal 2022 and then come in well below its FY21 levels in fiscal 2023. And its most recent EPS estimates are coming in beneath the current consensus.Target has also missed our adjusted earnings estimates by an average of 33% in the trailing three quarters. TGT is the Bear of the Day given its near-term outlook and the continued unknowns ahead on the consumer spending and inflation fronts.Target does remain a possible long-term play given its overall standing and strength within a key segment of the consumer-driven U.S. economy. And Target stock is down about 40% from its highs. But TGT just surged off oversold RSI levels a few weeks ago and some investors might want to wait for a slightly better entry point.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These properties are able to meet the needs of a wide variety of manufacturers, significantly reducing the time required to construct facilities and ultimately bring products to market.“South Carolina has a strong track record of attracting industrial projects with significant investment,” said Tom Tisa, head of business development at CSX. “The Central South Carolina Megasite is an outstanding location for another high-impact investment that capitalizes on the environmental advantages of rail and CSX’s commitment to helping customers lower their carbon footprint.”CSX introduced the Select Site program in 2012 to better serve new and existing customers on its network and those of its short line partners. CSX works with Austin Consulting, a nationally known site-selection consulting firm, to screen candidate sites and assist communities with the application and certification process.“It’s rare to find a property this large that is adjacent to both a railroad mainline and an interstate highway at an existing interchange, with all utilities on site,” said Jonathan Gemmen, senior director, Austin Consulting.Access to the 1,426-acre site is located half mile north of Interstate 20, less than a 30-minute drive northeast from downtown Columbia.“As Columbia and the Central SC Region continue to grow at a pace faster than the nation, this site receives more and more interest from prospects,” said Nelson Lindsay, president and chief executive officer of the Central SC Alliance.Kershaw County identified the megasite property over 15 years ago as an opportunity to attract a large industrial user that could generate new jobs and investment with the potential to transform communities. Subsequently, Kershaw County performed all the necessary due diligence studies, such as environmental, archaeological, endangered species, wetland delineation and multiple geotechnical studies. Large portions of the megasite have been cleared and a 500,000-gallon water tank is under construction on the north end of the site.Story continues“Kershaw County has the finest and most-ready megasite in the state,"" said Julian Burns, chairman of Kershaw County Council. ""Taking part in the CSX Select Site program demonstrates Kershaw's commitment to economic development.""The Central South Carolina Megasite is now the third site in South Carolina with the CSX Select Site designation.

This will bring a simple, easy-to-operate and wire-free home theatre set-up to customers.The newly launched TVs have brought in an added source of revenue for the company along with its streaming platforms and other smart home devices. However, it will be challenging for Roku to create market space for its TVs, given that there are already very trusted TV brands in the market such as Samsung, LG and others for many years now.Roku to Gain From Its Hardware Business SegmentRoku has recently been making efforts to expand itself into the hardware technology segment and widen its offerings. Prior to Roku-branded TVs, it had also launched a new suite of smart home products including security cameras, video doorbells, lighting and plugs at Walmart’s WMT online and offline stores.These smart home products are expected to act like customer acquisition tools for Roku as they can be integrated and connected with Roku’s operating system platform. These provide customers with technology to simplify and enhance their everyday lives.The competitive edge that Roku believes its hardware product has over other competitors is the pricing. The recently launched TVs could be bought at the low price of $119 while the average price of a smart TV is around $776, per Techpenny.Roku Smart Home cameras too start below $27 whereas the average price of indoor cameras is around $100, per Security.org. The company believes it has the potential to capture markets and gain customers through its attractive pricing strategy.However, the current macroeconomic conditions can be a headwind for Roku. The global chip shortage is ongoing and could even worsen in the coming future given that China, a leading supplier of it, is facing a new wave of COVID-19. This could hinder the production of TVs and smart home products and bring down sales.Shares of Roku have declined 78.2% in the last year compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, which fell 31.9% in the same period.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderRoku currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Liberty Media FWONK and Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Liberty Media’s share price decreased 3.9% year over year.

Also, sequential improvements in group travel and business transient demand bode well. However, supply chain challenges and inflationary pressure are headwinds.Let us delve into the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Growth CatalystsShares of Hyatt have gained 25.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 10.5% growth. The upside can be attributed to a rise in leisure transient demand, easing of travel restrictions and ramped-up airline capacity. During the third quarter of 2022, leisure transient revenues reached 20% above 2019 levels on a comparable system-wide basis. Given the continued strength of leisure travel demand, favorable pricing environment and airlift activities, the company is optimistic about continued growth in demand through the first quarter of 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSequential improvements in group travel and business transient demand have been aiding the company’s performance. The company stated that system-wide group room revenues, which were down 7% (from 2019 levels) in June 2022, improved to being down 3% (from 2019 levels) in October 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, the company witnessed a rise in group bookings at its Americas full-service managed hotels on a year-over-year basis.As people return to office, travel restrictions have been eased and more cross-border travel resumes, the company is optimistic about the recovery of business transient and its continued momentum over the remainder of the year. This and strength in short-term bookings coupled with strong food and beverage spending are likely to support the recovery process in the upcoming periods.The company continues to expand its presence to drive growth. During the third quarter of 2022, 22 new hotels (or 4,243 rooms) joined Hyatt's system. As of Sep 30, 2022, Hyatt executed management or franchise contracts for approximately 550 hotels (or 114,000 rooms). Recently, the company announced its plan to expand the Independent Collection brands’ footprint by 2025. By 2025, the company’s Independent Collection brands will have 11 new hotels in their portfolio.Story continuesIncreased focus on the integration of Apple Leisure Group bodes well. During the third quarter, the company reported solid segmental performance owing to strength in net package RevPAR, increased membership contracts for ALG’s Unlimited Vacation Club (approximately 9,200), guest departures (approximately 682,000) and strong unit pricing.During the quarter, total net package revenues were up 91% from 2019 levels. The upside was backed by significant net room growth, courtesy of ALG’s expansion in Europe and organic growth in the Americas. Also, solid demand for leisure destinations, increased airlift capacity and a favorable pricing environment added to the positives.Given distribution capabilities with an end-to-end booking process and strong operational execution, an integrated experience (with AMR and UVC program) and destination management services, the company is optimistic about ALG’s performance in 2023.ConcernsThe Hotel and Motels industry is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic and Hyatt isn’t immune to the trend. During the third quarter of 2022, the company reported reduced demand in Greater China owing to the crisis. Although the company commenced its recovery process, we believe that the emergence of the new COVID-19 variant is likely to create volatility in demand. It also remains cautious of supply chain challenges and increases in costs (due to inflation).Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksHyatt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

208,5a0af0bb-d815-35fa-aec6-b86c067261a2,ADI,2023-01-06,"Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) Stock Is Going Strong But Fundamentals Look Uncertain: What Lies Ahead ?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-110130957.html,1673002890,STORY,['ADI'],"[Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 10% over the last three months. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. Specifically, we decided to study Analog Devices'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:7.5% = US$2.7b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Analog Devices' Earnings Growth And 7.5% ROEWhen you first look at it, Analog Devices' ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 19% either. Analog Devices was still able to see a decent net income growth of 12% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesWe then compared Analog Devices' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 29% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ADI? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Analog Devices Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?While Analog Devices has a three-year median payout ratio of 75% (which means it retains 25% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Additionally, Analog Devices has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 40% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 16%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about Analog Devices. While the company has posted a decent earnings growth, We do feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings at a higher rate of return. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.17%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.02%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.45%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the global payments processor had gained 2.31% over the past month. This has outpaced the Business Services sector's loss of 4.42% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.25% in that time.Visa will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2, up 10.5% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $7.66 billion, up 8.51% from the year-ago period.V's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $8.28 per share and revenue of $31.73 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.4% and +8.26%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Visa. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. V's industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.77 as of yesterday's close.The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector.

(V) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-attracting-investor-140002721.html,1672927202,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this global payments processor have returned +2.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.3% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has lost 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.28 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.4%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.47 indicates a change of +14.3% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $7.66 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.5%. The $31.73 billion and $35.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.3% and +10.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.12%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Amphenol's (NYSE:APH) look very promising so lets take a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Amphenol, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$2.5b ÷ (US$15b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Amphenol has an ROCE of 20%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Amphenol roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amphenol compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Amphenol.So How Is Amphenol's ROCE Trending?Amphenol is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 20%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 52%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.The Bottom Line On Amphenol's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Amphenol can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Since the stock has returned a solid 80% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Amphenol can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Amphenol, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

A sharp drop in distillates and shrinking gasoline inventories also showed that crude consumption remained strong through the holiday season.China, the world’s largest crude importer, said on Thursday that it will reopen its border with Hong Kong by January 8, in another step away from the country’s strict zero-COVID policy. The move ramped up expectations of an eventual economic recovery in the country, which is expected to spur a sharp bounceback in oil demand.Brent oil futures rose 0.8% to $79.44 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1.1% to $74.44 a barrel by 21:23 ET (02:23 GMT). While both contracts marked a second straight day of recovery from three-week lows, they were still set to lose about 7.5% this week after a dismal start to the new year.Strength in the dollar limited gains in crude prices on Friday, as investors awaited U.S. nonfarm payrolls data that is expected to show some easing in the country’s tight jobs market.But markets were wary of any signs of resilience in the jobs market, which could give the Federal Reserve more headroom to maintain its hawkish rhetoric.The minutes of the central bank’s December meeting showed that policymakers support smaller rate hikes in the coming months. But they also called for U.S. interest rates to stay higher for longer, a scenario that could weigh further on economic activity, and dent crude demand.Story continuesOil prices plummeted in the first two sessions of 2023 after the International Monetary Fund warned of a potential recession in several major economies. Weak economic prints from the world’s two largest oil consumers- the U.S. and China- added to concerns over a recession, as both countries saw manufacturing activity shrink in December.Rising COVID-19 cases in China also brewed fears of a staggered reopening in the country, even as the government moves further away from its strict zero-COVID policy. The country is dealing with its worst-yet COVID-19 outbreak, which analysts warn could stymie economic growth in the near-term and cause increased market volatility.Related ArticlesOil extends rebound on positive demand cues, but still set for weekly lossesGold turns flat before payrolls data, copper cheered by China reopeningMichigan Democratic Senator Stabenow will not seek re-election in 2024]"

But given that the reading has consistently topped estimates for eight months running, markets fear that any signs of resilience in the jobs market will give the Fed enough headroom for more hawkish moves.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,834.53 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,839.25 an ounce by 19:50 ET (00:50 GMT). Still, both instruments were set for a 0.5% gain this week- their third straight week in black.Gold prices were supported by recent signals from the Fed that the central bank will likely raise interest rates at a slower pace in 2023, after a series of sharp hikes in the prior year. Fears of a looming recession in 2023 also saw bullion prices benefit from a resurgence in safe haven demand.But central bank policymakers indicated that they will likely hold rates higher for longer, with curbing inflation being their main focus. This has brewed much uncertainty over exactly where U.S. rates will peak, given that inflation is still well above the Fed’s target 2% rate.The Fed also indicated that it will look for some cooling in the job market to ease its hawkish rhetoric. But so far, the U.S. labor market has remained resilient despite headwinds from slowing growth.Safe haven demand helped gold largely outperform other precious metals for the week. Platinum futures were down 1.3% this week, while silver futures shed nearly 3%.Among industrial metals, copper prices traded flat after sharply reversing recent losses on Thursday after the Chinese government said it will reopen the border with financial hub Hong Kong on January 8.Story continuesThe move points to the relaxing of more anti-COVID curbs in China, and ramped up optimism over a broader reopening in the country. Copper futures were flat around $3.8252 a pound and were headed for a third straight week of gains, following an over 2% rally on Thursday.Still, China is facing an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases after the country relaxed curbs in December. Analysts have warned that this trend could delay a broader reopening, and also cause near-term market volatility.Related ArticlesGold turns flat before payrolls data, copper cheered by China reopeningOil prices extend gains on lower U.S. fuel inventoriesMichigan Democratic Senator Stabenow will not seek re-election in 2024]"

Even though the recent downtrend in copper prices is concerning, prices will eventually pick up due to the strong demand for the metal.Output Impacted By Lower Grades, Expected to Pick UpIn the first nine months of 2022, the company registered a 9% year-over-year decline in copper production at 653,430 tons. This was mainly due to work stoppage at the Cuajone mine, as well as lower ore grades. SCCO expects copper production of 900,000 tons for 2022, which is 3% lower than its earlier stated target of 922,000 tons. It also indicates a 7% decline from 965,466 tons in 2021. Nevertheless, these numbers are expected to pick up eventually and reach 926,100 tons in 2023. This will be made possible by the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production on projects of Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrators.Metal Prices to Pick Up in the Long TermCopper prices have been on a downtrend amid the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, as new coronavirus restrictions in China affected the demand for the red metal, thus hurting prices. Zinc prices also bore the brunt of weak demand worries as COVID lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession. Silver prices have also been negatively impacted, weighed down by the stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth.The long-term outlook for copper is positive, as copper demand is expected to grow, driven by electric vehicles and renewable energy, and infrastructure investments. Copper prices will be supported by growth in public infrastructure investment in the United States, as well as global initiatives to address climate change.Molybdenum prices are set to increase on the back of healthy demand and reduced supply. Long-term fundamentals for zinc remain strong due to its significant industrial consumption. Silver prices will gain eventually, given its industrial use, impending demand-supply imbalance and on safe-haven demand.Story continuesIndustry Leading Reserves &amp; Low Cost: A Winning CombinationSouthern Copper has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates high-quality, world-class assets in investment-grade countries such as Mexico and Peru. Backed by its constant focus on increasing low-cost production and growth investments, the company is well-poised to continue delivering enhanced performance. Its efforts to lower costs have aided the company in negating the impacts of higher costs for diesel and fuel, operating and repair materials, supplies and energy, as well as higher labor costs.Solid Projects on TrackSouthern Copper’s total investment program in Peru runs to $7.9 billion, including the Michiquillay ($2.5 billion) and Los Chancas ($2.6 billion) projects. Peru is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves. Peru’s national output is expected to grow to 206,999 tons in 2023 and 211040 tons in 2024. Michiquillay is expected to become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will produce 225,000 tons of copper per year (along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver) for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash cost. Production is expected by 2029.The Los Chancas project located in Apurimac, Peru is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. The project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The project is expected to commence in 2027.The company has a number of other projects that might be developed in the future, which will help it attain a copper volume production target of 1.5 million tons by 2028.Price Performance Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s shares have gained 1.1% over the past year compared with the industry’s 13.7% growth.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderSouthern Copper currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are CalMaine Foods CALM, Sociedad Quimica y Minera SQM and Reliance Steel RS.

221,9edcbef9-9180-39a1-88a8-46396be5c3a6,KLAC,2023-01-06,KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) insiders sold US$1.2m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kla-corporation-nasdaq-klac-insiders-120037771.html,1673006437,STORY,['KLAC'],"[Over the past year, many KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for KLA KLA Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Mary Wilkinson, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$320 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$373. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 21% of Mary Wilkinson's stake.In the last year KLA insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.KLA Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of KLA shares. Specifically, Independent Director Jeneanne Hanley ditched US$203k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes KLA Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. KLA insiders own about US$82m worth of shares. That equates to 0.2% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About KLA Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, KLA makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for KLA that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course KLA may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

They are positioning themselves to take advantage of the time people spend in their cars as a source of potentially lucrative, recurring revenue.""This is a field which can be deployed very quickly,"" Dirk Hilgenberg, head of Volkswagen AG's CARIAD software unit, told Reuters at CES. ""You could just host the third-party app for a streaming service, or generate joint platforms. You guarantee certain volumes, you guarantee certain revenue.""While car radios have been an entertainment staple in vehicles for decades, Tesla vehicles have reset consumer expectations with the ability to watch popular video streaming services, such as Netflix, YouTube and Hulu, while the vehicle is parked and charging.In December, Tesla issued a ""holiday update"" to its software to add access to 1,000 PC games through the Steam platform.Other automakers have followed suit. In October, BMW announced a partnership with AirConsole to bring casual gaming into its vehicles. Stellantis last year announced plans to add Amazon.com Inc's Fire TV for Auto to its new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs.In Las Vegas, South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Co said it would use technology developed by Nvidia Corp, a company whose chips power PC gaming, to stream games in cars.Nvidia's cloud-based game service, known as GeForce Now, would provide access to more than 1,000 titles from PC game stores such as Steam, as well as free-to-play games such as Fortnite. China's BYD and Swedish electric vehicle brand Polestar also are working with Nvidia.Story continuesJapan's Sony, the maker of the market-leading PlayStation video game console, on Wednesday at CES said its newly christened electric vehicle, Afeela, would be powered by the same Unreal Engine 3D technology used in video games.Sony promised ""best in class"" movies, games and music, though it offered few details on the vehicle it is developing jointly with Honda Motor Co.""In order to realize intelligent mobility, continuous software updates and high-performance computing are required,"" Yasuhide Mizuno, chief executive of Sony Honda Mobility, told the trade show.The auto industry has been grappling with how to introduce these new features safely, and restrict use to passengers while the vehicle is in operation.Tesla became the focus of regulators in 2021 following reports that one feature allowed drivers to play games on the cars' tablet-like touch screen. Tesla disabled the feature while the car was in motion.Hilgenberg said Volkswagen is developing vehicles that can drive themselves on the highway or in traffic jams, which could give drivers and passengers more time to view videos or play games. But those vehicles will have safety systems that could shut down gaming or video displays to the driver if conditions made automated driving unsafe, he said.Still, these are features that consumers are demanding, so VW is at CES seeking partnerships.""In some regions, we will see people say, 'You don't have that? I'm not buying,"" Hilgenberg said. ""We will see the content ... which is provided by software enabled functionality will be a decisive factor for buying.""

The new processors are designed for gamers and creators and provide 14% faster performance than the previous generation.For mobile gamers, AMD introduced the Ryzen 7045HX Series Mobile processors to deliver up to 18% faster single-threaded performance and up to an incredible 78% faster-multithreaded performance over the 6900HX to develop performance.The new Ryzen processors will be available in Alienware, ASUS, Lenovo and MSI PCs beginning February 2023.AMD’s recent launch of Ryzen processors reflects the company’s strategy to keep benefiting from high-growth business segments like high-performance computing and gaming.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and ConsensusAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and ConsensusAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD Addressing High Growth Markets to Boost ProspectsAMD shares slumped 14% compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 8.1% and 9.6%, respectively, in the six-month period.High inflation, rising interest rate hikes and uncertain forex situation led the broader tech sector into the doldrums, reflected by AMD’s peers NVIDIA NVDA and Intel INTC, which also bore the brunt of the situation.AMD reported third-quarter 2022 revenues of $5.7 billion, an increase of 29% year over year.The company’s results reflect lower-than-expected client segment revenues resulting from reduced processor shipments due to weaker demand in the PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain due to rising inflation recession.In order to deal with the slowing demand for PCs, AMD is developing its processors to cater to gamers and high-performance computing.Story continuesAMD has constantly been improving the performance of its Ryzen, Xilinx and Pensando processors to help address the increasing proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in industries like cloud, gaming and data center.However, as it ventures into new markets, the company faces rising competition from the likes of NVIDIA.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the data center, professional visualization and gaming markets, where its peers are close on its heels. NVDA has been benefiting from the rapid proliferation of AI. The company has been expanding its base in untapped markets like climate science, energy research, space exploration and digital biology.Intel is still the leading name in the consumer PC market and is the major competitor of AMD in this segment. INTC is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by transitioning to data-centric businesses such as AI and autonomous driving.Nevertheless, AMD, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to benefit from its plans to address new markets, accelerate data center growth and enter the AI and Augmented Reality spaces with its launch of various products by building strategic partnerships with companies like Dell Technologies and OEM partners like Hewlett Packard HPE, Acer and Lenovo. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.AMD is also leading its peers in the HPC business segment as it enables customers across various fields like manufacturing, life sciences, financial services, climate research and more to utilize supercomputers for research purposes.However, it is worth mentioning that AMD powers five of the top 10 most powerful and eight of the top 10 most energy-efficient supercomputers globally. CSC’s LUMI supercomputer powered by AMD EPYC and AMD Instinct MI200 systems is third on the Top500 list with 152 petaflops of performance and third on the Green500 list with 51.63 gigaflops/watt power efficiency, while the Adastra system at GENCI-CINES is 10th on the Top500 list and fourth on the Green500 list.Also, AMD’s EPYC CPUs and Instinct Accelerators power the world’s fastest and most energy-efficient supercomputer — Frontier — which the company built in partnership with HPE.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With 64% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week's US$9.2b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 42% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Walt Disney. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walt Disney?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Walt Disney does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Walt Disney's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Walt Disney. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.9% of shares outstanding. With 6.3% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Walt DisneyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Walt Disney Company insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$59m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 36% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Walt Disney. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Walt Disney better, we need to consider many other factors.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

If you want to read about some more ETFs, go directly to 5 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2022.Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allow investors to buy a collection of stocks or other assets in just one fund with mostly low expenses, and they trade on an exchange like stocks. In the last decade, ETFs have become tremendously popular and now hold trillions of dollars in assets. An exchange-traded fund may be included in different assets, such as stocks, bonds and sometimes commodities. Most often, ETFs hold a specific index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 or the NASDAQ 100. So, by buying one share in the ETF, an investor effectively purchases a share in all the assets held in that fund.Actively managed ETFs had shrunk away from the spotlight in recent years as a growth dominated marketplace favored passive funds. However, the swing towards value stocks has also increased the spotlight on actively managed ETFs. Actively managed ETFs have a manager or a team of individuals taking decisions. Cathie Wood was the most popular active ETF manager last year (see Cathie Wood is loading up on these 12 stocks), but her reputation took a big hit in 2022.We strongly believe that active investing is the right strategy to generate superior returns. Insider Monkey focuses on the stocks that are purchased by hedge funds and corporate insiders (see 12 stocks insiders are buying), and this approach worked very well for our readers over the years. However, there are several other active investing strategies that can yield superior returns. One issue with active investing is the higher fees charged by hedge funds, mutual funds, and actively managed ETFs. The outperformance generated by these active funds has to be greater than the fees (performance and/or management fees) charged by these funds. That's why we are Do-It-Yourself (DIY) investors.Investors prefer actively managed ETFs over DIY investing mainly because of the convenience and the ease of trading in and out of the ETF. Some of the top stocks in the portfolios of best actively managed ETFs in 2022 included The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continuesOur MethodologyThe aim of the article is to provide readers with a basic rundown of the best performing actively managed ETFs in 2022. These were picked using a database managed by VettaFi, an ETF analytics firm. We picked those ETFs that posted the strongest performance in 2022, based on their YTD 2022 gains through December 29. Equity ETFs were preferred for the list. All the ETFs listed below trade on exchanges in the United States. The top holdings of each fund are mentioned alongside other details for further clarity. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to quantify the hedge fund sentiment around each top holding.10 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2022Source: pexelsBest Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 202210.

When I saw Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long-time executive at Conagra Foods who sensed an opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…read more Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2022.Suggested Articles:10 Best Uranium Stocks To Buy11 Best TaaS Stocks To Invest In11 Best Recycling Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

Tim, good to talk to you this morning.I realize all these companies have their own narratives going, but I'm curious if we can start on the demand picture because we have heard this over and over, questions about reaching a saturation point. Are we continuing to see the demand for this type of content even if consumers are saying I'm willing to go with a cheaper ad-supported tier?TIM NOLLEN: Yeah, I think demand is still high, but there's so much competition now. You know, we've been talking about the streaming wars for two or three years already now. All of the major TV network groups have shifted toward direct-to-consumer streaming, and a lot of them are going after that same audience.So in a slowing economy, consumers are looking at their wallets, and they're choosing to be more selective in which subscription services they are paying for. So you get this sort of constant churn on and off and on and off different services as you watch one show on Netflix. Drop that. Watch a show on Amazon Prime. Drop that, et cetera. So it's a much more competitive landscape.It doesn't mean that demand is going down. I just think there's so much more availability of programming now. Consumers have just been spoiled for choice, and now they're just going to be looking more carefully at what they choose to pay for.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And unlike Netflix, if you're a Disney or an Amazon, you have other business entities that you can rely on, you know, under your umbrella then. So let's start with Disney then. In terms of Bob Iger's return, how much of a difference do you think that's going to make to Disney's story?Story continuesTIM NOLLEN: Yeah, well, we've thought for a long time that Disney will-- and it's certainly proven to be the case-- be one of the winners in this whole multiyear transition from traditional, linear TV viewership to streaming. I mean, Disney has obviously the brand presence globally. They've got the depth of content. They've got all of the, you know, popular content still being introduced in new form-- so new Star Wars series, new Marvel series, et cetera, on the streaming platform. So we think the opportunity is vast for Disney, and they've certainly demonstrated that thus far.They have, as most of-- really, as all of their peers have, invested very, very heavily in the content base, and that's just been a necessity given the competition. In Disney's case, it looks like calendar year '22 might have been the worst of times in terms of the operating performance of the streaming service. They've signaled quite strong that they intend to get that service toward profitability over the next eight quarters, so sometime during fiscal year '24. So as soon as four to six quarters from now, you could have the DTC, the Direct to Consumer, streaming services-- which is Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+-- moving into at least break-even status in the next year and a half or so. That would be taken very, very positively, I think, by investors, and, you know, it hopefully will be a stepwise trend to get to that.Now what Bob Iger brings coming back to Disney is, you know, hopefully we-- you know, investors are certainly hoping more of that magic that he brought over so many years-- the employee relations, the external communications, the fans. I don't know if there are major, major strategic shifts coming, but if he can just bring that magic touch back to Disney, I think the stock can rebound.AKIKO FUJITA: And, Tim, you've highlighted in terms of revenue drivers for Disney+, you know, that ad-supported tier that was launched last year could be a big revenue driver in the amount of $800 million, but I'm more curious about the two overhangs we always talk about when it comes to Disney. It's the future of Hulu but also ESPN. Increasingly, a lot of analysts have pointed to the fact that they believe ESPN could be spun off. Is that a move that would make sense for you?TIM NOLLEN: Yeah, it's been a topic of debate for some time. I think Disney sees great value in ESPN and is trying to find a way to move that into a fully over-the-top streaming service. Now, this has been a big discussion point for a long time, and it's very contentious because, you know, as we've discussed for many years, that could be the move that really breaks the pay TV bundle. If you can get ESPN completely over the top without subscribing to a pay TV service, then why would you have pay TV at all? And so it's a huge change that is going to come eventually, and one of the things we're wondering is if this is maybe the biggest issue that Bob Iger will have to wrestle with during his act two here at Disney.It's a tough question because there is a lot of money still being made on the linear bundle side. For all the talk about cord cutting and the declines there, the operating margins are still high, so it's very cash generative.Now, one catalyst for this move could be the upcoming NBA-rights renewal. The new contract is due to start in 2025, so there's a couple of years to go, a few years to go, but these negotiations usually take place a couple of years beforehand. So it could very well be that 2023 is the year that the NBA is negotiating with ESPN and with Turner networks over at Warner Brothers Discovery to actually renew this contract. There will be a big price increase, and my estimate is ESPN can handle that if they can wrap in a lot more streaming availability of that content. So it could be an important step toward getting ESPN to a completely over-the-top service.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, really fascinating to see some of those negotiations play out there. Tim Nollen, Macquarie senior media tech analyst, appreciate your time.]"

The move comes as part of the company’s acquisition-driven growth strategy.Located at 14805 S. Maple Avenue, the property comprises a 51,000-square-foot building, which is leased on a short-term basis through June 2023. The building will be demolished after that and the property will be redeveloped into a 2.8-acre improved land parcel.The property’s advantageous location — between the Los Angeles International Airport and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and adjacent to Terreno Realty’s improved land parcels at 14725 and 14732 S. Maple Avenue — is likely to attract tenants. The redeveloped property’s estimated stabilized cap rate is 6.2%.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for industrial real estate space has been shooting up. TRNO is banking on such opportunities and is focused on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions.Further, the company is targeting functional assets at in-fill locations. Such assets enjoy high-population densities and are located near high-volume distribution points.With such expansion efforts, Terreno Realty is well-poised to enhance its portfolio in six major coastal U.S. markets — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami and Washington, DC. These markets display solid demographic trends and witness healthy demand for industrial real estate.In recent months, Terreno Realty shelled out $15.4 million to purchase an industrial property in Elizabeth, NJ. Located at 629 Henry Street, the property comprises one industrial distribution building containing roughly 23,000 square feet on 1.8 acres. It is 100% leased on a short-term basis. The property is advantageously located adjacent to the Newark Liberty International Airport and Exit 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike. The estimated stabilized cap rate is 5.4%.Terreno Realty expended $17 million to purchase an industrial property in Los Angeles, CA. Also, TRNO acquired an industrial property in Miami, FL, for $4.7 million.Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, the industrial real estate space is poised to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including TRNO, Prologis PLD and First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. FR, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Shares of Terreno Realty, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have climbed 10.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.6%.

Investors are bullish regarding the stock amid this as the company is investing heavily in more quality products, building a stronger supply chain and upgrading services to attract more customers and boost top-line growth.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +104%. Revenues are expected to be $938.26 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Dingdong Cayman Limited Sponsored ADR, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

RHI has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 2.2%.Factors That Augur WellRobert Half’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was 1.82 at the end of third-quarter 2022, higher than 1.79 recorded at the end of the prior quarter and the prior-year quarter’s 1.67. The gradually increasing current ratio bodes well for Robert Half. Moreover, a current ratio of more than 1.5 is usually considered good for a company. This may imply that the risk of default is less.Robert Half offers risk consulting, internal audit and information technology consulting services through its wholly-owned subsidiary Protiviti, currently in great shape and firmly positioned in the market. For third-quarter 2022, Protiviti’s revenues came in at $511 million, up 5% year over year on an as-adjusted basis.The U.S. Protiviti revenues of $416 million increased 4% year over year on an adjusted basis. Non-U.S. Protiviti revenues of $95 million rose 7% year over year on an as-adjusted basis.Commitment to shareholder returns prompts Robert Half a reliable way for investors to compound wealth over the long term. In 2021, RHI paid out $170.6 million of dividends and repurchased shares worth $287.7 million. In 2020, Robert Half paid out $155.9 million of dividends and repurchased shares worth $159.1 million. Such shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence in the stock but also positively impact a company's earnings per share.A Key RiskRobert Half is witnessing an increase in expenses due to the rise in staff compensation costs and heavy investments in technology initiatives.

272,aeb11a9b-0b61-3a0a-bcd0-d8ae920f5bf9,TROW,2023-01-06,Is T. Rowe Price European Stock (PRESX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-european-stock-120012066.html,1673006412,STORY,"['TROW', '^GSPC']","[If you've been stuck searching for Mutual Fund Equity Report funds, you might want to consider passing on by T. Rowe Price European Stock (PRESX) as a possibility. PRESX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 5 (Strong Sell), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerT. Rowe Price is based in Baltimore, MD, and is the manager of PRESX. Since T. Rowe Price European Stock made its debut in February of 1990, PRESX has garnered more than $565 million in assets. Tobias Mueller is the fund's current manager and has held that role since July of 2020.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 3.01%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 2.4%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 20.54%, the standard deviation of PRESX over the past three years is 22.58%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 19.34% compared to the category average of 17.71%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsWith a 5-year beta of 0.94, the fund is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -6.48. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.ExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, PRESX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1% compared to the category average of 1.31%. PRESX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.Story continuesInvestors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500 and that each subsequent investment needs to be at $100.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price European Stock ( PRESX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, T. Rowe Price European Stock ( PRESX ) looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.Want even more information about PRESX?

(UPS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-ups-trending-140002230.html,1672927202,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this package delivery service have returned +1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.3% change. The Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, to which UPS belongs, has lost 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $3.59 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.92 points to a change of +6.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.20 indicates a change of -5.6% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UPS, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $28.1 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $101.41 billion and $99.62 billion estimates indicate +4.2% and -1.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $24.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.2%. EPS of $2.99 for the same period compares with $2.71 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.65%. The EPS surprise was +5.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions.

(NYSE:MLM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-martin-marietta-132736598.html,1672925256,STORY,['MLM'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$859.1mUS$1.00bUS$1.09bUS$1.23bUS$1.31bUS$1.37bUS$1.42bUS$1.47bUS$1.51bUS$1.55bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.61%Est @ 3.82%Est @ 3.27%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$801US$871US$881US$928US$921US$899US$870US$838US$804US$769(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.6bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$30bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$15bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$23b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$348, the company appears about fair value at a 8.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Martin Marietta Materials as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.945. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Martin Marietta MaterialsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Basic Materials industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Basic Materials market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.9%, which is fairly typical for the industry. See our latest analysis for Pentair Pentair's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. However, Pentair's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 36.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 17%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The last annual payment of $0.88 was flat on the annual payment from10 years ago. It's encouraging to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth anyway, which makes this less attractive as an income investment.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Pentair has impressed us by growing EPS at 29% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like Pentair's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Pentair is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

280,497ce847-57ef-3f5d-bf5f-bbb33b0d5ab5,MDLZ,2023-01-06,Why These 7 Consumer Stocks Could Soar in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-7-consumer-stocks-could-180222204.html,1672682542,STORY,"['KO', 'MDLZ', 'GIS', 'PEP', 'PG', 'AAP']","[This article will highlight seven consumer stocks to buy in 2023, and here’s why. While energy and bank stocks are strong choices, the investor should not count out the consumer. Inflation and rising interest rates were supposed to crush consumers in 2022, but that didn’t happen, at least not to the extent investors expected.However, that may be changing. In the last quarter there’s been a definite shift in way several companies are viewing their earnings outlooks. It’s possible that companies are racing to lower the bar so they can surprise to the upside. Nevertheless, the effect of interest rates is just beginning to be felt in the economy, and that means consumers may be wearing down. So, if their forecasts are correct, it’s going to be a challenging year.That being said, consumers will still buy, but those purchases are likely to be more selective. Therefore, when considering consumer stocks to buy, this may not be a time to look for perfection. It is, however, a time to have conviction in companies that provide products and services that will be in demand, no matter what is happening in the economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven consumer stocks to buy that will help you ride out the volatility in 2023.AAPAdvance Auto Parts$129.93KOCoca-Cola$63.61PEPPepsi$180.66GISGeneral Mills$83.85PGProcter &amp; Gamble$151.56CWHCamping World$22.32MDLZMondelez International$66.65Advance Auto Parts (AAP)The outside of an Advanced Auto Parts storefront.Source: James R. Martin / ShutterstockUsed car prices are coming down, and that may good for those consumers who have nursed their current ride through the pandemic and record-high inflation. It may also be more bullish for a company like Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) than you may think.Automobiles have a long shelf life. The way I see it, the biggest threat to auto parts dealers is electric vehicles which have fewer moving parts. At the same time, cars are long-term investments.Story continuesSo, every used car with an internal combustion engine that’s bought in the next year is potentially one less electric vehicle in the short term. That may not be the case in ten years, but it looks like the case today.AAP stock is down approximately 39% in 2022. The company is having difficulty meeting year-over-year revenue and earnings comparisons. And with the company’s profit margin being lower than the sector average it implies that the company continues to struggle with passing along higher costs.However, the company has taken steps to speed up its inventory turnover. That would expand margins and boost earnings, both of which should result in share price growth. Plus, it will secure a dividend that currently has a yield of 4.10% and pays out $6 per share on an annual basis.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comNext on my list of consumer stocks to buy is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). The logic here could be summarized as ‘if it’s not broken, why fix it’. Coca-Cola is a well-known Warren Buffet stock; so one of the first places to look is the company’s dividend. The company is part of the exclusive dividend kings club, having increased its dividend in each of the last 60 years.I won’t pretend that Coke is an inexpensive stock. It has a P/E ratio well above the sector average. However, it continues to justify that premium valuation. Despite the challenges of the last two years, Coke continues to grow earnings, and more of the same is expected in 2023. One reason for that is a profit margin of over 20% that highlights the pricing power of the company’s products.Detractors may point out that KO stock has not been a particularly strong performer. I’m not here to disagree. But in 2023, investors should still be thinking about keeping it in the fairway. And if you drive the ball like me, you’re looking for stocks that are more forgiving.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockNormally I wouldn’t put both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) on a list like this. But when it comes to consumer stocks to buy in 2023, you can’t go wrong with either one.I think Coca-Cola might deliver slightly stronger earnings growth. However, PepsiCo has a broader portfolio that includes both beverages and snack foods. And while the company’s offering does include Doritos (a staple in my house), some of the other offerings, such as those in its Quaker Foods division, are on the healthier side.Putting that aside, this is a low beta stock with strong fundamentals. Its profit margin is slightly above the sector average. The company’s P/E ratio is a bit on the high side, but it seems to be backed up by projections for strong growth in the next five years.And while Coca-Cola is a legendary dividend king, Pepsi has also entered that exclusive club. The company has now increased its dividend in 50 consecutive years and has a dividend yield of 2.55% as of this writing.General Mills (GIS)A General Mills (GIS) sign on a General Mills office in Ontario, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comGeneral Mills (NYSE:GIS) makes this list of consumer stocks to buy, despite the GIS stock price currently being above analysts’ forecasts. GIS stock shot higher after its earnings report on December 20, 2022, but it’s since given up most of those gains as analysts are concerned about declining revenue in its pet food segment.However, in that earnings report, General Mills scored a slight beat on both the top and bottom lines. And, it raised its earnings outlook for 2023. That’s got to be worth something, right?Maybe it will; it’s too early to tell. However, as I wrote about Coca-Cola, this is a time when investors need to look for reliability. That’s what you get with GIS stock. If the company does continue to post earnings growth, it may breakout to a new record high. And if that happens, then the company’s dividend, which currently has a 2.58% yield, will look even better.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comStock charts can tell you what’s happening with a stock. It’s up to you to figure out why. Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock is down over 7% in 2022. But, it’s ticked up in the last month. The company last reported earnings in October. So, why are investors diving into PG stock?In the past, capitulation has meant that investors bailed out of stocks altogether. In 2022, that may very well mean that investors are giving up on sensational growth and fleeing to the security of reliable dividend payers. With a track record of increasing dividends for 66 consecutive years, Procter &amp; Gamble certainly fits that description.Earnings aren’t supposed to grow that much in 2023. But at a time when many companies are predicting declining earnings, that gain should be celebrated. And the company has a P/E ratio that’s in-line with the sector average. The company also has one of the sector’s, and the market’s, best profit margins.Camping World (CWH)Camping World (CWH) logo on a smartphone in front of an American flag background.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comCamping World (NYSE:CWH) may seem like a wild card among consumers stocks to buy. The bears will say that RV sales peaked in 2021. Therefore, higher interest rates and recession fears will slow sales of discretionary purchases like camping equipment.But while the company’s forward sales may be normalizing, major RV manufacturers are still filling their pandemic backlog. And once consumers have a recreational vehicle, it just makes sense to use it. Plus, while camping equipment is an expense, once the equipment is purchased, it can last for years, making camping an economical alternative for many consumers.To be fair, I don’t expect Camping World to continue growing its dividend at the 34% clip it has for the last three years. But at a P/E ratio of just 4x earnings, Camping World looks like a small-cap steal while it’s trading near its 52-week low.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockLast on my list of consumer stocks to buy is Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ). I’ve had MDLZ stock on my watchlist for most of 2022, and 2023 may be the year I pull the trigger.The company has a broad portfolio that includes snack foods, such as Oreos and chocolate candy. The company’s products remain in demand as is seen in rising year-over-year revenue and earnings.That means the company has pricing power. That’s one reason MDLZ stock is slightly higher in 2022, despite being down close to 20% as recently as September 2022. In 2023, like 2022, companies will be rewarded for having pricing power. Mondelez is also growing in emerging markets.And Mondelez hasn’t just been growing its business; it’s been growing its dividend. Over the last three years, the company has posted an average of over 11% growth in its dividend. It currently has increased its dividend in each of the last 10 years and has an attractive yield of 2.31%.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

The deal, whose financial details were not disclosed, has enabled Bruker to make a majority-ownership investment in Biognosys.Moreover, several of Biognosys’ earlier investors have sold their shares to Bruker in a secondary transaction. Following this, Bruker will make new primary investments in Switzerland-based Biognosys.The latest partnership is expected to significantly solidify Bruker’s Life-Science Mass Spectrometry business in the United States.Rationale Behind the PartnershipBruker’s latest collaboration with Biognosys is expected to create unique synergies between Biognosys’ versatile portfolio of proprietary proteomics services, software and kits and Bruker’s pioneering timsTOF platform. Biognosys is currently planning to open its first advanced proteomics contract research organization (CRO) services laboratory in Massachusetts using the timsTOF platform as a result of the strategic partnership.Bruker’s management believes that its tie-up with Biognosys will likely enable it to expand its CRO business in the United States. The company currently has many common biomarker and biopharma customers. Hence, potential customers may prefer a well-known proteomics CRO services player like Biognosys for rapid, outstanding and flexible insertion of proteomics into their biomarker or biopharma discovery and development. Per management, with the rapid scientific acceptance of its dia-PASEF workflows, the partnership will likely offer a unique combination of proteomics applications and data-science expertise. This is expected to benefit more biopharma and diagnostics companies using unbiased proteomics for decision-making, per Bruker.Biognosys’ management feels that the collaboration with Bruker will enable it to leverage the companies’ unique synergies to allow customers to explore the depth of the proteome from early research to clinical development.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Precedence Research, the global proteomics market was estimated to be $26.1 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $74.8 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 12.41%. Factors like the growing demand for personalized medicines, an increase in the number of advanced diagnostics tools in targeted disease and treatment and an increase in research activities are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest partnership is likely to provide a significant boost to Bruker’s business in the United States.Notable AgreementsLast month, Bruker announced that its Bruker Energy &amp; Supercon Technologies division and majority-owned RI Research Instruments GmbH had received multi-year contracts to supply key technology components for major fusion projects in Europe and Asia, together valued at approximately $50 million.In November, Bruker announced the signing of the definitive agreement to purchase 100% of the shares of Neurescence Inc., a provider of ultralight fiber-bundle Multiscopes for simultaneous multi-region, optical functional neuroimaging.The same month, Bruker announced the acquisition of Inscopix, Inc., a neuroscience pioneer and provider of miniaturized microscopes, known as miniscopes, for freely moving animal brain imaging.Price PerformanceShares of Bruker have lost 8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 9.9% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 19.2% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Bruker carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

A sound financial position also acts as an additional tailwind for the stock.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCigna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.The stock has gained 36.4% in a year compared with the industry’s 12.7% growth. The Medical sector and the S&amp;P Index have declined 12.5% and 19.7%, respectively, in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreCI is well-poised for progress, as evident from its impressive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors.Robust 2023 ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CI’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.81 per share, indicating an improvement of 7.2% from a year earlier estimate, while the same for revenues stands at $189.4 billion, implying a 5.2% increase from the prior-year estimate.Impressive Surprise HistoryCI’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 9.84%.Business TailwindsSolid performances of the Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare segments continue to drive Cigna’s performance. CI intends to achieve 10-13% average annual adjusted earnings per share growth on a long-term basis.Solid specialty pharmacy services continue to drive the growth of the Evernorth platform. Thereby, Cigna’s December 2022 announcement to include biosimilars as preferred products within its commercial formularies from 2023 seems a prudent move in order to upgrade the pharmacy products suite.Meanwhile, the Cigna Healthcare segment is aided by growing premiums resulting from an extensive customer base within its U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government businesses. An aging U.S. population is expected to sustain solid demand for Cigna’s Medicare plans, which fall under its U.S. Government business. In addition to a solid premium base, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits on the back of continuous product expansions and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems. As of Sep 30, 2022, total medical customers of CI rose 5.6% year over year.Story continuesSuch promising prospects of the two growth platforms propelled Cigna to divest non-health units and intensify focus on the core units. The proceeds received from the sell-offs were tactically utilized by CI to bring down the mounting debt burden and continually engage in share repurchases.Cigna also boasts a solid financial standing, substantiated by growing cash reserves and robust cash-generating abilities. The financial strength can be leveraged by the health insurer to undertake uninterrupted business investments.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Medical space are STAAR Surgical Company STAA, Boston Scientific Corporation BSX and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ISRG. While STAAR Surgical sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boston Scientific and Intuitive Surgical carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

BIO is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by robust demand in Life Science and Clinical Diagnostics arms. The company’s earnings for the third quarter of 2022 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  However, declining sales and tough competition are concerning.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 36.5% against a 41.2% fall of the industry and a 19.2% decline of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned manufacturer and global supplier of clinical diagnostics and life science research products has a market capitalization of $12.84 billion.In the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 31.2%, way ahead of the industry’s 10.2% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 13.4% increase. The company’s earnings have surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 31.52%.Let’s delve deeper.Key DriversQ3 Upsides: Bio-Rad exited the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. The company experienced currency-neutral year-over-year core revenue growth in Europe and Asia. Strong demand was witnessed for Life Science and Clinical Diagnostic products. The company’s organization is broadly back to normal operations. Bio-Rad also had modestly higher-than-expected demand for COVID-related products, particularly in the Asia Pacific.Segmental Growth:  Despite supply-chain constraints, underlying Life Science year-over-year currency-neutral core revenue growth was 9.4%. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by Western loading, qPCR, process media and antibody products. Bio-Rad continues to see a strong order backlog for ddPCR instruments as it continues to work through supply-chain challenges.Core Clinical Diagnostics’ year-over-year revenue growth, excluding COVID-related sales, increased 3.7% on a currency-neutral basis. Quality control, blood typing and infectious disease products drove the Diagnostics group's currency-neutral year-over-year sales.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Focus on International Markets: In recent times, Bio-Rad has been deriving more than 60% of its net sales from international markets. Europe happens to be the largest international market for the company.In the third quarter, the company experienced currency-neutral year-over-year core revenue growth in Asia and Europe. Life Science experienced currency-neutral year-over-year core revenue growth across both regions. The diagnostics group’s year-over-year currency-neutral core revenues grew in the Americas and Asia.DownsidesExposure to Foreign Currency: Bio-Rad derives more than 50% of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency. In the past several years, the company’s earnings were significantly affected by foreign exchange.Tough Competitive Pressure: Bio-Rad operates in a highly competitive environment dominated by firms varying from large multinational corporations to start-ups. Also, the competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets, wherein the company operates, limit its ability to switch to strategies like price increases and other drivers of cost increases.Estimate TrendsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bio-Rad’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $14.38, suggesting an 8.2% fall from the year-ago reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 revenues is pinned at $2.83 billion, indicating a 3.3% fall from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, Boston Scientific Corporation BSX and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

Here's what the World Health Organization's emergencies program director had to say.MIKE RYAN: We know there are difficulties in all the countries, very often, in recording hospital releases, admissions, and use of ICU facilities, but again, we believe that the current numbers being published from China underrepresents the true impact of the disease in terms of hospital admissions, in terms of the ICU admissions, and particularly, in terms of deaths.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, here to weigh in on that and the outlook for the pharmaceutical industry is B of A Global Research's senior pharmacy analyst Geoff Meacham. Geoff, good to have you on the show. So I first want to get your take on how you think the situation coming out of China is being handled by, say, the US and by the EU as well.GEOFF MEACHAM: Yeah, it's a great question, and thank you for having me. For the most part, I would say it's difficult for the companies that we follow in the pharma space to really manage the situation in China, other than just to provide enough supply, so vaccines and orals, for example, Pfizer's Paxlovid and Moderna and Pfizer's vaccines as well. So there hasn't really been a supply constraint there. I would say China has purchased incremental amounts of the COVID therapies, but not anywhere near like what we're seeing from the infection rates. And so that's a big thing to watch in the next six months.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, how big of a catalyst do you think that can be when you look at some of the big biopharma names? We think back to the height of the pandemic, how well a Moderna or a Pfizer did. When you think about the needs over in China, do you see that as a significant catalyst for these companies?Story continuesGEOFF MEACHAM: I don't really, from an investor perspective. And I say that because 2020, 2021 were years of-- sort of two years of a windfall, really, for the Pfizers and Modernas of the world. Also, Lilly benefited, Regeneron, companies that have any sort of product for COVID, be it antibody or vaccine. But I would say last year, the numbers started to come down a little bit. And then '23 and beyond are really years where we're not expecting a big uptake. And so if stocks move on, let's say, temporary Chinese demand, the thought is that may not have the durability that people really expected prior to the beginning of the pandemic.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we know that BofA downgraded Pfizer to neutral from-- by partly because, obviously, the heydays of the pandemic, at least in the US and for most of the world, is behind us. And you also said they're continuing to enter increasingly crowded markets as well. Where does the growth story for Pfizer then go from here?GEOFF MEACHAM: Yeah, it's a good question. There are a number of really exciting products that they have coming out. So for migraine, for example, for some GI diseases like ulcerative colitis, some inflammation, broadly, hematology, oncology. So these things are-- they're all new products. They have some sort of differentiation. Or they could be launching in the next, say, 6 to 12 months. The issue is that they're just not going to be big enough to move the needle for a top line that Pfizer has.And you have, at the same time, COVID contracting this year and next year. So we're not saying that it won't happen. But I think these new launches and these new products are not really going to build momentum, I think, until, say, three, four years from now. And that will be about the same time frame that Pfizer is going to face some big patent expiry. So we're not negative on it. We're just saying maybe better places to put money for this year.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Goeff, you mentioned COVID contracting. Obviously, the strains are still there, but not at the level that we saw over the last few years. With that in mind, what are some of the big biotech, biopharma names you're especially bullish on, given the pipeline?GEOFF MEACHAM: Yep. Yeah, so there's a couple that we like in the biotech space. So Vertex is one of them. They're a very significantly, very rapidly growing CF business. Cystic fibrosis is their core franchise, but they have an encore to that with a sickle cell drug maybe launching end of this year and perhaps a pain drug, which could be de-risked in the next couple of-- quarter or two.The other one we like is Biomarin, more of a rare disease, kind of orphan drug company, a very stable base of growing rare disease assets. But the big one is Roctavian which is a gene therapy, cell therapy for hemophilia. It's approved in Europe, but could be approved in the US in the next couple of months. And that would really start to drive top line. And really, the adoption there has a lot of runway to it, obviously, post-approval.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we'll certainly be keeping an eye also on M&amp;A in the space as well. BofA senior pharm analyst Geoff Meacham, thank you for joining us this morning.]"

This company, which is in the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This railroad has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6.46%.For the most recent quarter, Norfolk Southern was expected to post earnings of $3.64 per share, but it reported $4.10 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.64%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $3.44 per share, while it actually produced $3.45 per share, a surprise of 0.29%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Norfolk Southern. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Norfolk Southern currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.42%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 25, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(NASDAQ:INTU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.5% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 33% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Intuit which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intuit. See our latest analysis for Intuit ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuit?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Intuit does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuit's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Intuit. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.8% of shares outstanding. With 8.5% and 5.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of IntuitThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can see that insiders own shares in Intuit Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$2.9b. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Intuit. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Intuit  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

However, pricing pressure remains a headwind.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 25.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 23.8% in the past six months. The S&amp;P 500 Index has declined 1.6% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $93.11 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 8.8% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 4% compares favorably with the industry’s (0.94%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book, courtesy of the platform’s unique features, despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. These, in turn, position it well to sustain the momentum in robot sales.Stryker is committed to the continued expansion of Mako. Although the company saw softening in Mako installation during the third quarter due to variability in the hospital environment, it expects strong demand in the fourth quarter. The company continues to focus on the continued expansion of the platform. This growth reflects the demand for Stryker’s differentiated Mako robotic technology.Taking into account the normalization of the customer environment, management anticipates another strong year for Mako in 2022. The company’s Mako order book remains solid for 2022 and is in sync with its aim of continued share gains in both hips and knees.Additionally, Stryker has a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products shields the company against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil. Its significant exposure to robotics, artificial intelligence for health care and Medical Mechatronics has helped the company stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. Stryker’s portfolio includes products like Hip, Knee and Mako robotic-arm assisted surgeries.Story continuesOn its third-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries after getting adversely impacted last year due to COVID. The company stated that it is reaching normalized levels across most of its business. Moreover, it expects hospital staffing pressure to resolve gradually, leading to higher procedures in 2023.Per management, the company’s sustained support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the pandemic subsides. In the third quarter of 2022, Stryker’s adjusted R&amp;D expenses were 7.1% of net sales, highlighting its sustained commitment to innovation. Per management, this is likely to drive new product launches. In September, Stryker launched its new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System— for spine application. The company received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its OptaBlate bone tumor ablation systemin the same month.Moreover, Stryker’s action to lessen the inflationary pressure and cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins look promising. The 9.2% year-over-year decline in SG&amp;A expenses during the third quarter was probably due to these actions, implying that margins may improve going forward.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable pricing environment poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses. On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the period’s average selling days were in line with third-quarter 2021. The impact from pricing was 0.7% in the last reported quarter. Consequently, pricing pressure remains a cause of concern. Moreover, unfavorable currency rate fluctuation also hurt top-line growth, which may continue to impact revenues moderately in 2023.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $9.17 and $9.83, respectively, suggesting year-over-year growth of 0.9% and 7.3%. The consensus mark for 2022 and 2023 revenues stands at $18.22 billion and $19.19 billion, respectively, indicating an improvement of 6.5% and 5.3% year over year.Stryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

(SoCalGas) today announced a $1 million contribution to the Gas Assistance Fund, a program that helps income-qualified customers pay their natural gas bills. Customers will be facing bills that could be double or higher compared to last year's winter bills.The high bills are a result of historically high natural gas prices in the western United States.  SoCalGas doesn't set the price for natural gas. Instead, natural gas prices are determined by national and regional markets.  SoCalGas buys natural gas in those markets on behalf of residential and small business customers, and the cost of buying that gas is billed to those customers with no markup, meaning SoCalGas does not profit from gas commodity prices going up.According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), a number of factors are contributing to higher natural gas commodity prices.Widespread, below-normal temperatures on much of the West Coast, including Washington and Oregon;High natural gas demand for heating by customers in areas with below normal temperatures;Reduced natural gas supplies to the West Coast from Canada and the Rocky Mountains;Reduced interstate pipeline capacity to the West Coast because of pipeline maintenance activities in West Texas; andLow natural gas storage levels on the West Coast.A detailed report about these market conditions can be found here: https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/weekly/.The Gas Assistance Fund is a joint effort between SoCalGas and United Way of Greater Los Angeles, working with non-profit organizations throughout our service territory, to help income-qualified customers pay their natural gas bill with a one-time grant of up to $100 per household. Full guidelines for qualification can be found at https://www.socalgas.com/gaf.Story continues""We know that these higher prices have a real impact on our customers,"" said Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer Gillian Wright. ""But we want them to know that there is help. We have valuable information on how to conserve energy, programs to assist with managing your energy usage and an unprecedented contribution to our Gas Assistance Fund, which will help our most vulnerable customers pay their bills.""To help customers manage energy usage and possibly save on bills, SoCalGas recommends the following tips:Lowering your thermostat three to five degrees – if health permits – can save up to 10 percent on heating costs.Installing proper caulking and weather-stripping can save roughly 10 to 15 percent on heating and cooling bills.Washing clothes in cold water to save up to 10 percent on water heating costs.Considering turning down the temperature on your water heater.Limiting use of non-essential natural gas appliances such as spas and fireplaces.SoCalGas' free Ways to Save tool may also help customers find ways to save on natural gas bills, with a personalized savings plan that offers a household energy analysis, customized energy-efficiency recommendations, bill comparisons and energy usage comparisons. Ways to Save can be found at www.socalgas.com/waystosave.Customers can also sign up for weekly Bill Tracker Alerts to monitor gas consumption, take steps to reduce usage, and avoid bill surprises. Alerts are sent through email or text and include a bill-to-date and projected next bill amount to help manage energy bills as easily as possible. Eligible customers may also sign up for a Level Pay Plan (LPP), which averages their annual natural gas use and costs over 12 months.SoCalGas also encourages individuals who are experiencing hardship to explore the many bill payment or assistance programs options it offers or to call 1-800-427-2200. Customers may be eligible for one of many assistance programs including:California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE): Eligible participants can save 20 percent on their natural gas bill.

303,b9373b39-d23f-38de-8f7a-fa4906ca9d03,UNH,2023-01-06,The total return for UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-return-unitedhealth-group-nyse-110059201.html,1673002859,STORY,['UNH'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stock is up an impressive 114% over the last five years. On the other hand, we note it's down 9.8% in about a month. This could be related to the soft market, with stocks down around 2.9% in the last month.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 7.6%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, UnitedHealth Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 16% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of UnitedHealth Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of UnitedHealth Group, it has a TSR of 131% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that UnitedHealth Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 8.2% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 18% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand UnitedHealth Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group  you should be aware of.UnitedHealth Group is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond warns that things will get worse. Shares of the company plummeting this morning after the company said it's headed for major financial troubles. We've got the details in just a moment.JULIE HYMAN: Plus, trouble in tech as well. Amazon announcing the largest amount of layoffs in the company's history. Becoming just the latest company to shed workers after a year of aggressive hiring.BRIAN SOZZI: And a House divided. The lower chamber of Congress at standstill, after another failed speaker vote. Kevin McCarthy vows to fight on. But his opponents in the GOP seem just as resilient. We'll break-- we'll bring you the latest on the DC drama.But, of course, I'll begin today with a market check. Julie, over to you. Lots of things moving, markets, you name it.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and we've got a plunge in the futures that was happening after we got the ADP jobs reading earlier this morning. Coming out with a gain of 235,000, versus the 150,000 that economists had been anticipating. And also an upward revision for the prior month.Now, remember we get the big government jobs report tomorrow. And that's really the one that the markets key off of. Indeed, there was a little bit of caution this morning being expressed that ADP doesn't always line up with the government jobs report.Of course, the concern here is that with the job market still expanding at this pace, it's gonna make the Fed's job even harder. Might have to put its foot on the gas pedal even more. Especially emphasized after the Fed minutes yesterday seemed to express concern on the part of Fed participants that the market is not going down enough, not tightening financial conditions enough.So you see futures down this morning. NASDAQ futures down even more, as you might expect. They tend to be more rate sensitive. And of course, we've got Treasury futures going lower. That means rates are going higher, reflecting this perception about the Fed. Here's the 10-year note. We're seeing that at 3.75%.And then a quick check as well as to what's going on with some of those large-cap tech stocks in particular.

If you want to read about some more ETFs, go directly to 5 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2022.Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allow investors to buy a collection of stocks or other assets in just one fund with mostly low expenses, and they trade on an exchange like stocks. In the last decade, ETFs have become tremendously popular and now hold trillions of dollars in assets. An exchange-traded fund may be included in different assets, such as stocks, bonds and sometimes commodities. Most often, ETFs hold a specific index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 or the NASDAQ 100. So, by buying one share in the ETF, an investor effectively purchases a share in all the assets held in that fund.Actively managed ETFs had shrunk away from the spotlight in recent years as a growth dominated marketplace favored passive funds. However, the swing towards value stocks has also increased the spotlight on actively managed ETFs. Actively managed ETFs have a manager or a team of individuals taking decisions. Cathie Wood was the most popular active ETF manager last year (see Cathie Wood is loading up on these 12 stocks), but her reputation took a big hit in 2022.We strongly believe that active investing is the right strategy to generate superior returns. Insider Monkey focuses on the stocks that are purchased by hedge funds and corporate insiders (see 12 stocks insiders are buying), and this approach worked very well for our readers over the years. However, there are several other active investing strategies that can yield superior returns. One issue with active investing is the higher fees charged by hedge funds, mutual funds, and actively managed ETFs. The outperformance generated by these active funds has to be greater than the fees (performance and/or management fees) charged by these funds. That's why we are Do-It-Yourself (DIY) investors.Investors prefer actively managed ETFs over DIY investing mainly because of the convenience and the ease of trading in and out of the ETF. Some of the top stocks in the portfolios of best actively managed ETFs in 2022 included The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continuesOur MethodologyThe aim of the article is to provide readers with a basic rundown of the best performing actively managed ETFs in 2022. These were picked using a database managed by VettaFi, an ETF analytics firm. We picked those ETFs that posted the strongest performance in 2022, based on their YTD 2022 gains through December 29. Equity ETFs were preferred for the list. All the ETFs listed below trade on exchanges in the United States. The top holdings of each fund are mentioned alongside other details for further clarity. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to quantify the hedge fund sentiment around each top holding.10 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2022Source: pexelsBest Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 202210.

Four worldwide companies dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long-time executive at Conagra Foods who sensed an opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…read more Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2022.Suggested Articles:10 Best Uranium Stocks To Buy11 Best TaaS Stocks To Invest In11 Best Recycling Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

308,512ff82a-8263-3546-8bd3-83ec269e8737,PG,2023-01-06,Bridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter & Gamble,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bridgewaters-billion-dollar-bet-procter-154239969.html,1672933359,STORY,['PG'],"[The single biggest holding among the 866 stocks in Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio)'s Bridgewater Associates' portfolio is Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), according to the firm's latest 13F filing for the third quarter of 2022. Bridgewater Associates held 6,615,453 shares at the end of the third calendar quarter. Based on the Jan. 3, 2023 closing price of $152.33, that makes the holding worth $1,007,731,955.49.PG 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PGPeter Lynch Chart of PGBridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleInvestors should be aware that 13F reports do not provide a complete picture of a gurus holdings. They include only a snapshot of long equity positions in U.S.-listed stocks and American depository receipts as of the quarters end. They do not include short positions, non-ADR international holdings or other types of securities. However, even this limited filing can provide valuable information.Procter &amp; Gamble represents 4.23% of Bridgewaters 13F portfolio, a significant commitment. Let's take a closer look at this stock to see what Dalio's firm might like about it.About Procter &amp; GambleFounded in 1837 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where it is still headquartered, the consumer products company has a market cap of $359.17 billion and had trailing 12-month revenue of $80.461 billion.The company noted in its 10-K for fiscal year 2022 (which ended on June 30) that it has a portfolio of leading brands, 20 of which generate more than $1 billion dollars a year in global sales, such as Tide, Charmin, Pantene and Pampers.The company no longer has any food brands, with the last of them, Pringles, being sold to Kellogg (NYSE:K) in 2012. International sales accounted for about 55% of consolidated sales in fiscal 2022.CompetitionProcter &amp; Gamble describes its competition as follows: The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors.Story continuesThis five-year chart shows it has frequently outperformed the S&amp;P 500, and significantly outperformed its peer index:Bridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleThe company says it considers itself well-positioned to keep its market share and margins. Many products have the leading or major shares in the markets they serve. Backing up its well-known brand names are patents and trademarks, along with advertising, promotions and other marketing tools.Financial strengthFirst, lets acknowledge Procter &amp; Gamble has a lot of debt, but on the positive side, it has been similarly indebted for more than a decade:Bridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleThus, that doesnt concern me much. Its interest coverage ratio is 39.14, which tells us the company generates $39.14 in operating income for every dollar of interest expense. Its hard to imagine the firm getting into trouble because it could not pay the interest on its debt.The Altman Z-Score of 5.44 means that in terms of bankruptcy risk, Procter &amp; Gamble is well into the safe zone.The companys weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 4.74% while its return on invested capital (ROIC) is 13.42%. That means it creates extra value for shareholders by working with borrowed funds.As for the companys philosophy on the use of debt, it wrote in the 10-K, We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital.ProfitabilityProcter &amp; Gamble has been profitable for all 10 years of the past decade. That reflects its industry-leading operating and net margins of 22.03% and 18.11% respectively. Indeed, all of its key profitability measures are industry-leading, based on the GuruFocus summary page.Where the company has faced headwinds is in issues over which it has limited control. In its first-quarter fiscal 2023 report, it noted,P&amp;G said its current fiscal 2023 outlook includes headwinds of approximately $1.3 billion after-tax due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, $2.4 billion due to higher commodity and materials costs, and $200 million from higher freight costs. Combined, these items are a $3.9 billion after-tax headwind, or approximately $1.57 per share, to fiscal 2023 earnings versus fiscal 2022, or a headwind of approximately 27 points to EPS growth. The $3.9 billion headwind is an increase of $600 million after-tax versus guidance provided in July, primarily driven by foreign exchange.Its earnings per share without non-recurring items were $5.81 in fiscal 2022, so a loss of $1.57 per share is material. Analysts from Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) expect $5.81 again for full fiscal 2023.GrowthThe GuruFocus system gives Procter &amp; Gamble a better-than-average growth rank of 7 out of 10. Thats based on its three- and five-year revenue growth rates, the predictability of the five-year revenue growth rate and the five-year Ebitda growth rate:Bridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleThis five-year chart shows that revenue has grown, and grown predictably over the past three and five years:Bridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleExcept for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Ebitda has been relatively stable:Bridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleAddressing earnings per share without non-recurring items will require two charts. The first shows EPS without NRI on a quarterly basis, up to the end of fiscal 2022:Bridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleThat looks much like the chart for Ebitda and indicates that quarterly returns have been flat over the past five years. But, if we look at an annual chart, we might get the impression that profitability has grown over the past three years:Bridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleSo, dont be misled by the high earnings growth rates in the table above. There has been a rapid recovery, not a rapid gain, in Ebitda and EPS without NRI.Why was the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 so bad? It wasnt, in a manner of speaking. As its earnings release for the period explained, it was due to a one-off charge: Diluted net loss per share was $2.12, down $2.84 versus the prior year due primarily to one-time, non-cash accounting adjustments to the carrying values of the Gillette Shave Care business.Dividends and share repurchasesBridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleAt 2.35%, the Procter &amp; Gamble dividend yield is higher than the latest average for S&amp;P 500 companies, though that's not saying much. But, the most important characteristic of its dividend situation is its status as a Dividend King. Having raised its dividend for 66 consecutive years, it is well above the Dividend King minimum of 50 years. Only 41 of the many thousands of publicly traded stocks have reached this elite level.Over the past 10 years, it has consistently raised its dividend by an average of 4.45% per year. Until this year, that has beaten inflation by a significant margin, and likely will again when inflation gets back to around the 2% level.It also has bought back its own shares quite consistently over the past decade, reducing the number of shares outstanding by an average of 1.66% per year. Combined with the dividend yield, that indicates a return to shareholders of roughly 4% per year - if the market were rational (which it often is not).ValuationThe GF Value chart, which comprises historical multiples, a proprietary adjustment factor based on past returns and growth and estimates of future performance, finds the current valuation fair:Bridgewater's Billion-Dollar Bet on Procter &amp; GambleAt the close on Jan. 4, 2023, the share price was $153.33, just above the GF Value price of $151.72.The price-earnings ratio is 26.57, which is relatively poor compared to the rest of the consumer packaged goods industry median of 17.51.Over the past five years, the Ebitda growth rate was 9.10% per year, and dividing the price-earnings ratio by the Ebitda growth rate provides a PEG ratio of 2.92. Thats above the PEG fair-value standard of 1.00.Because of that dip in Ebitda and EPS without NRI in 2019, the company has a one-star business predictability rating.Overall, the data indicates a fair to modestly-overvalued share price.GurusProcter &amp; Gamble is one of the most popular stocks among the investing legends, with 22 of them holding positions at the end of September.Despite reducing his stake by 1.95% in the third calendar quarter, Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio)'s Bridgewater still had 6,615,453 shares.Stephen Yacktman is also a major investor. His Yacktman Asset Management (Trades, Portfolio) held 2,953,251 shares after a 3.23% reduction in the quarter. The Yacktman Fund (Trades, Portfolio) owned the bulk of that with 1,450,000 shares.Institutional ownership comes in at 59.74% and insiders have a 0.28% stake.ConclusionI believe that Procter &amp; Gamble is a good company, despite its debt and current valuation. It owns leading brands and has delivered solid returns to shareholders for years. The dividend is among the most reliable available. It buys back its own shares when prices are appropriate and because of its popularity among investors, its share price keeps rising.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But as a passenger, the smelly ordeal ends when the flight does, if not before. For flight attendants, it’s another story.At American Airlines, the problem grew acute enough last year that flight attendants reported worker illnesses from such fumes to the airline—and were punished by their employer for doing so. That’s according to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).American Airlines “retaliated against flight attendants who reported worker illnesses caused by toxic fumes entering aircraft cabin,” OSHA said Wednesday.The agency initiated a whistleblower investigation on Aug. 2, 2022, after “flight attendants alleged the airline docked attendance points and discouraged them from reporting work-related injuries and illnesses,” it said.“Our investigation found that the flight attendants engaged in protected activities when they reported illnesses related to jet fuel fumes seeping into the aircraft cabin,” said OSHA Area Director Timothy Minor in Fort Worth, Texas, where the airline is based, in the statement. “Workers must feel empowered to inform managers and others about potential hazards that jeopardize workers’ safety and health.”OSHA whistleblower statutes specifically protect airline workers from retaliation if they report violations of Federal Aviation Administration regulations. For this violation, OSHA’s proposed fine against American Airlines is a mere $6,837, but it serves as a warning and generates bad publicity. ​A 'chilling effect' on whistleblowers“When employers punish employees for doing so, they create a chilling effect that may stop workers from reporting future issues, putting their health and well-being, and that of coworkers, at risk,” Minor warned.An American Airlines spokesperson wrote to Fortune: “The safety of our team members and customers is always American’s top priority. We respectfully disagree with the investigator’s findings and have scheduled a conference with OSHA to further discuss the investigation.”Story continuesFortune also reached out to OSHA for comments but received no immediate replies.In 2017, American Airlines flight attendants complained about headaches after an Airbus A330 landed in Orlando. The same aircraft had experienced at least three fumes-related incidents in the previous three months, ABC News reported at the time.But it isn’t just American Airlines.A plane’s engines suck in outside air, some of which gets sent into the air-conditioning systems. If there’s a broken seal or some other mechanical problem, toxic gases can leak into the air breathed by crew and passengers.“This is the tobacco and asbestos of aviation,” said pilot Eric Tellmann at a 2016 meeting of American Airlines pilots, according to the Los Angeles Times. He recounted nearly passing out from fumes while serving as a copilot with Spirit Airlines the previous year.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: San Francisco being hit with a ‘brutal’ storm so severe that a meteorologist says is ‘one of the most impactful’ he’s ever seenHow will the ultrawealthy ride out the recession? 1,200 investors worth $130 billion have one big strategyBlaming Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest on the COVID vaccine is ‘wildly and irresponsibly speculative,’ says expertMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

314,6c448a06-3eed-306e-81e5-fb7deeffb932,AAL,2023-01-06,I have 10 minutes to clean a plane before passengers board. Here’s why the holidays’ air travel chaos was entirely avoidable,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-minutes-clean-plane-passengers-170100445.html,1672938060,STORY,['AAL'],"[Air travelers are still reeling from the impacts of a busy and chaotic holiday travel week. From thousands of canceled Southwest Airlines flights to painful delays due to inclement weather–they’re not the only ones left frustrated. Workers like me are hurting along with them.Much of this air travel dysfunction was entirely avoidable. The root of the issue is that for too long, major corporations have created and exacerbated a crisis for airport workers and travelers alike while raking in record profits. Major airlines and their contractors have received billions of dollars in federal funding, and for what? Worse service for passengers and jobs that still often pay poverty wages without enough protections. And it’s airport service workers, like me, who’ve been unfairly tasked with cleaning up the mess.In February of last year, I started working cleaning cabins for a company that cleans American Airlines planes at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. A large part of my job is to make sure that passengers have a clean and safe cabin for their travels. I’m also responsible for doing safety inspections to ensure the plane is free of weapons and anything that could pose a danger to passengers or crew. In other words, the safety of everyone on the plane depends in part on the work that I do. With that level of responsibility, one would think that workers like me would be respected, protected, and paid living wages for the vital work that we do. Sadly, that’s far from the case.I’m proud of the work I do and love interacting with passengers–but the high turnover and short staffing are making my job nearly impossible. Oftentimes, I have less than 10 minutes to clean each plane, and with fewer people available to help, I’m constantly being saddled with more work, as well as responsibilities that extend beyond my role, like helping with translation for Spanish-speaking passengers and workers. Despite the extra work, I make just $12/hr. I can barely make ends meet, sometimes even having to skip meals to ensure my girls have enough to eat.Story continuesThe fact is, airport service workers across the country aren’t being paid enough to support their families or pay the bills. Yet revenues continue to soar for major corporations like American Airlines, who just last year made a record $13.5 billion in revenues off our backs. At airports here in Dallas and across the country, workers’ wages have been near the poverty level for the past 20 years with no paid time off, no affordable healthcare, no sick days, insufficient staffing, and no guaranteed worker protections.Even still, workers like me continue to show up every single day to keep our economy and our world connected, and we’ll keep showing up this year through travel peaks, holiday chaos, and beyond to help ensure people can safely travel. But airlines created this problem, and they need to fix it.That’s why I’m standing with workers across the country to demand that Congress take action to ensure that public money serves the public good. The Good Jobs for Good Airports Act, introduced last year in the Senate, would establish a minimum wage and benefits standard for service workers at certain hub airports across the country, which would in turn help stabilize the workforce, help lower turnover, and increase the number of experienced frontline staff.Airports are powered primarily by Black, brown, and immigrant service workers like me, who work hard to give our families a better future. Congress has the power to radically transform my life by setting wage and benefits standards and ensuring public dollars are not reinforcing systemic racism. The holidays’ travel woes offer a timely reminder that we must reinvest in this vital workforce that helps keep our airports safe, clean, and running.We deserve to be treated better. We deserve jobs that pay us enough to survive, and workplaces that give us a voice on the job and the opportunity to live our lives with dignity, while caring for our families.Over the summer, I rallied with other workers outside American Airlines Headquarters to call on the CEO to make sure that all airport jobs are good union jobs, with fair wages and benefits.After months of silence from corporate executives, I joined members of Congress last month to demand action to uplift the airport service workforce. To borrow Senator Blumenthal’s words, “there is an ugly, dark truth here.” And it’s time our elected leaders heed workers’ calls: the workforce that powers our airports deserves a fair shot at a good life.As we start the new year, what better time to provide airport service workers a stable job with wages and benefits that could help us build a better future for our families? Congress must take action now.Verna Montalvo is a cabin cleaner at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and member of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:Will the U.S. and Europe slide into recession in 2023? Here’s how to look out when economic outlooks don’tBiggest CEO successes and setbacks: 2022’s triumphs and 2023’s challenges2023 will be the year of digital assassination.

315,52bdec76-8dc6-38e1-89a1-3390c9e78ae4,AAL,2023-01-06,American Airlines (AAL) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-upgraded-strong-170005639.html,1672938005,STORY,['AAL'],"[Investors might want to bet on American Airlines (AAL), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for American Airlines basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for American Airlines imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for American AirlinesThis world's largest airline is expected to earn -$0.18 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2022, which represents a year-over-year change of 97.9%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for American Airlines. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 19.7%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of American Airlines to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.79 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this specialty chemicals company would post earnings of $1.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.47, delivering a surprise of 12.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.RPM International , which belongs to the Zacks Paints and Related Products industry, posted revenues of $1.79 billion for the quarter ended November 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.64 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.RPM International shares have added about 0.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.4%.What's Next for RPM International?While RPM International has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for RPM International: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.42 on $1.48 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.58 on $7.26 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

The system serves approximately 250 properties in Sadsbury Township, Lancaster County, with sanitary sewer treatment service provided by adjacent Christiana Borough and Salisbury Township through contractual arrangements.""As the drinking water service provider to several southeastern Lancaster County communities, we are well positioned to serve Sadsbury Township through experienced, professional employees who can leverage the resources of our other local operations,"" said Pennsylvania American Water President Justin Ladner.

323,497ce847-57ef-3f5d-bf5f-bbb33b0d5ab5,PEP,2023-01-06,Why These 7 Consumer Stocks Could Soar in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-7-consumer-stocks-could-180222204.html,1672682542,STORY,"['KO', 'MDLZ', 'GIS', 'PEP', 'PG', 'AAP']","[This article will highlight seven consumer stocks to buy in 2023, and here’s why. While energy and bank stocks are strong choices, the investor should not count out the consumer. Inflation and rising interest rates were supposed to crush consumers in 2022, but that didn’t happen, at least not to the extent investors expected.However, that may be changing. In the last quarter there’s been a definite shift in way several companies are viewing their earnings outlooks. It’s possible that companies are racing to lower the bar so they can surprise to the upside. Nevertheless, the effect of interest rates is just beginning to be felt in the economy, and that means consumers may be wearing down. So, if their forecasts are correct, it’s going to be a challenging year.That being said, consumers will still buy, but those purchases are likely to be more selective. Therefore, when considering consumer stocks to buy, this may not be a time to look for perfection. It is, however, a time to have conviction in companies that provide products and services that will be in demand, no matter what is happening in the economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven consumer stocks to buy that will help you ride out the volatility in 2023.AAPAdvance Auto Parts$129.93KOCoca-Cola$63.61PEPPepsi$180.66GISGeneral Mills$83.85PGProcter &amp; Gamble$151.56CWHCamping World$22.32MDLZMondelez International$66.65Advance Auto Parts (AAP)The outside of an Advanced Auto Parts storefront.Source: James R. Martin / ShutterstockUsed car prices are coming down, and that may good for those consumers who have nursed their current ride through the pandemic and record-high inflation. It may also be more bullish for a company like Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) than you may think.Automobiles have a long shelf life. The way I see it, the biggest threat to auto parts dealers is electric vehicles which have fewer moving parts. At the same time, cars are long-term investments.Story continuesSo, every used car with an internal combustion engine that’s bought in the next year is potentially one less electric vehicle in the short term. That may not be the case in ten years, but it looks like the case today.AAP stock is down approximately 39% in 2022. The company is having difficulty meeting year-over-year revenue and earnings comparisons. And with the company’s profit margin being lower than the sector average it implies that the company continues to struggle with passing along higher costs.However, the company has taken steps to speed up its inventory turnover. That would expand margins and boost earnings, both of which should result in share price growth. Plus, it will secure a dividend that currently has a yield of 4.10% and pays out $6 per share on an annual basis.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comNext on my list of consumer stocks to buy is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). The logic here could be summarized as ‘if it’s not broken, why fix it’. Coca-Cola is a well-known Warren Buffet stock; so one of the first places to look is the company’s dividend. The company is part of the exclusive dividend kings club, having increased its dividend in each of the last 60 years.I won’t pretend that Coke is an inexpensive stock. It has a P/E ratio well above the sector average. However, it continues to justify that premium valuation. Despite the challenges of the last two years, Coke continues to grow earnings, and more of the same is expected in 2023. One reason for that is a profit margin of over 20% that highlights the pricing power of the company’s products.Detractors may point out that KO stock has not been a particularly strong performer. I’m not here to disagree. But in 2023, investors should still be thinking about keeping it in the fairway. And if you drive the ball like me, you’re looking for stocks that are more forgiving.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockNormally I wouldn’t put both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) on a list like this. But when it comes to consumer stocks to buy in 2023, you can’t go wrong with either one.I think Coca-Cola might deliver slightly stronger earnings growth. However, PepsiCo has a broader portfolio that includes both beverages and snack foods. And while the company’s offering does include Doritos (a staple in my house), some of the other offerings, such as those in its Quaker Foods division, are on the healthier side.Putting that aside, this is a low beta stock with strong fundamentals. Its profit margin is slightly above the sector average. The company’s P/E ratio is a bit on the high side, but it seems to be backed up by projections for strong growth in the next five years.And while Coca-Cola is a legendary dividend king, Pepsi has also entered that exclusive club. The company has now increased its dividend in 50 consecutive years and has a dividend yield of 2.55% as of this writing.General Mills (GIS)A General Mills (GIS) sign on a General Mills office in Ontario, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comGeneral Mills (NYSE:GIS) makes this list of consumer stocks to buy, despite the GIS stock price currently being above analysts’ forecasts. GIS stock shot higher after its earnings report on December 20, 2022, but it’s since given up most of those gains as analysts are concerned about declining revenue in its pet food segment.However, in that earnings report, General Mills scored a slight beat on both the top and bottom lines. And, it raised its earnings outlook for 2023. That’s got to be worth something, right?Maybe it will; it’s too early to tell. However, as I wrote about Coca-Cola, this is a time when investors need to look for reliability. That’s what you get with GIS stock. If the company does continue to post earnings growth, it may breakout to a new record high. And if that happens, then the company’s dividend, which currently has a 2.58% yield, will look even better.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comStock charts can tell you what’s happening with a stock. It’s up to you to figure out why. Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock is down over 7% in 2022. But, it’s ticked up in the last month. The company last reported earnings in October. So, why are investors diving into PG stock?In the past, capitulation has meant that investors bailed out of stocks altogether. In 2022, that may very well mean that investors are giving up on sensational growth and fleeing to the security of reliable dividend payers. With a track record of increasing dividends for 66 consecutive years, Procter &amp; Gamble certainly fits that description.Earnings aren’t supposed to grow that much in 2023. But at a time when many companies are predicting declining earnings, that gain should be celebrated. And the company has a P/E ratio that’s in-line with the sector average. The company also has one of the sector’s, and the market’s, best profit margins.Camping World (CWH)Camping World (CWH) logo on a smartphone in front of an American flag background.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comCamping World (NYSE:CWH) may seem like a wild card among consumers stocks to buy. The bears will say that RV sales peaked in 2021. Therefore, higher interest rates and recession fears will slow sales of discretionary purchases like camping equipment.But while the company’s forward sales may be normalizing, major RV manufacturers are still filling their pandemic backlog. And once consumers have a recreational vehicle, it just makes sense to use it. Plus, while camping equipment is an expense, once the equipment is purchased, it can last for years, making camping an economical alternative for many consumers.To be fair, I don’t expect Camping World to continue growing its dividend at the 34% clip it has for the last three years. But at a P/E ratio of just 4x earnings, Camping World looks like a small-cap steal while it’s trading near its 52-week low.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockLast on my list of consumer stocks to buy is Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ). I’ve had MDLZ stock on my watchlist for most of 2022, and 2023 may be the year I pull the trigger.The company has a broad portfolio that includes snack foods, such as Oreos and chocolate candy. The company’s products remain in demand as is seen in rising year-over-year revenue and earnings.That means the company has pricing power. That’s one reason MDLZ stock is slightly higher in 2022, despite being down close to 20% as recently as September 2022. In 2023, like 2022, companies will be rewarded for having pricing power. Mondelez is also growing in emerging markets.And Mondelez hasn’t just been growing its business; it’s been growing its dividend. Over the last three years, the company has posted an average of over 11% growth in its dividend. It currently has increased its dividend in each of the last 10 years and has an attractive yield of 2.31%.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

Quest Diagnostics recognizes the critical role that daily in-school learning plays in helping our kids to overcome the very real challenges they faced with repeated lockdowns, school closings, and the limitations of remote learning.In our commitment to supporting communities throughout the country, Quest has established multiple initiatives, including:Quest's ""Back to the Classroom"" program to help develop K-12 in-school COVID-19 testing solutions that allow students and staff to return to school safelyPartnerships to further expand testing access and capacity, including collaboration with biotechnology company Ginkgo Bioworks and agreements with multiple state departments of health, including Arizona (through its collaboration with Sonora Quest Laboratories), Texas, Pennsylvania, and more.

326,4828f05c-d838-36f4-8421-3bb0c2f6fc5d,AMP,2023-01-06,Will Ameriprise (AMP) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-amp-beat-estimates-again-171005400.html,1672938605,STORY,['AMP'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP), which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry.When looking at the last two reports, this financial services company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.94%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Ameriprise was expected to post earnings of $5.82 per share, but it reported $6.43 per share instead, representing a surprise of 10.48%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $5.73 per share, while it actually produced $5.81 per share, a surprise of 1.40%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Ameriprise, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ameriprise has an Earnings ESP of +2.45% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.
