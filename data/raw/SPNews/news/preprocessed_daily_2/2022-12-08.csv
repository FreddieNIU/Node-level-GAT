Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabThe Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$69.43 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$80.19. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 0.2% of Charles Schwab's holding.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Charles Schwab shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Charles Schwab Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Charles Schwab. Specifically, insiders ditched US$48m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Charles Schwab insiders own about US$9.5b worth of shares (which is 6.4% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since Charles Schwab is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Texas Instruments Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chairman, Richard Templeton, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.9m worth of shares at a price of US$178 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$174. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Texas Instruments insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Texas Instruments Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Texas Instruments insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$172m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Texas Instruments Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Texas Instruments stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Texas Instruments makes money, and is growing profits.

12,414874f3-0048-32b0-9490-9aeb11738875,STT,2022-12-08,State Street Global Advisors Launches its 2023 Global Market Outlook: Navigating a Bumpy Landing,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-global-advisors-launches-083000473.html,1670488200,STORY,"['STT', 'STT-PD', 'STT-PG']","[BOSTON, December 08, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Global Advisors, the asset management business of State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT), today published its 2023 Global Market Outlook: Navigating a Bumpy Landing on macroeconomic trends and key investment themes for the year ahead. State Street Global Advisors believes that market uncertainty and volatility will persist for some time and that investors should evaluate their fixed income and downside protection strategies as they await a possible recovery and a better environment for risk-taking.Despite the slowing global economy and geopolitical headwinds, State Street Global Advisors remains cautiously optimistic that an inflection point is in sight and that inflation across the globe will trend lower within the next six months. The firm believes that improved supply and slowing demand figures are likely to allow for powerful disinflationary episodes to unfold, and expects that more favorable inflation data will allow the Federal Reserve to downshift from its hawkish stance and likely cut rates in the last quarter of 2023.""We have seen the global economic slowdown intensify across both developed and developing economies, and we have lowered our projected global growth to 2.6% in 2023,"" said Lori Heinel, Global Chief Investment Officer. ""The near 20% appreciation of the US dollar in 2022 has also intensified the global growth challenge and may expose unanticipated vulnerabilities.""Equities walk a tightropeState Street Global Advisors believes that equities will begin to sustainably recover in 2023, but points out in its outlook that the pain equity investors feel is unlikely to subside until mid-year, with the exact timing of the relief tied to the actions of central banks.""Against this challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we are focusing on quality stocks, by which we mean companies with stable earnings and strong business models which we believe are resilient enough to manage pricing pressures,"" said Gaurav Mallik, Chief Investment Strategist. ""In emerging markets, the weakness of China markets and the strong US dollar limit equity opportunities. We expect that challenges and volatility will remain in 2023, but we also believe that investors should be prepared for a recovery and may benefit from deploying dry powder at a prudent time.""Story continues""As 2023 begins, many investors in the US expect the economy to weaken, corporate profits to face downward pressure, and job losses to rise due to the lag effects of aggressive Fed rate hikes,"" said Mike Arone, Chief Investment Strategist for the US SPDR Business. ""Markets anticipate sub-trend growth in 2023, but investors will likely begin to price in the next phase of the economic cycle before the economic, earnings, and job market data begin to show signs of recovery.""A buying opportunity in fixed incomeRising interest rates, market volatility, and widening spreads across sectors have pressured fixed income total returns with an intensity that few expected, leading to one of the most trying years for fixed income investors in recent memory. While headwinds are expected to continue in the near term, State Street Global Advisors believes that there will be bright spots for long-term investors in 2023, as widespread sell-offs and continued volatility have opened up some attractive opportunities.Michele Barlow, Head of Investment Strategy and Research, Asia Pacific, commented, ""We see value building in rates and prefer duration over spread products, and investment grade over high yield. As more clarity appears on the credit landscape, we see opportunities for investors to consider global fixed income markets, including emerging market debt, which has been repriced to attractive levels. There is growing evidence that a peak in rates is nearing, so while credit still faces some near-term headwinds, we think it will be a buying opportunity in the coming quarters.""More volatility, more downside protectionIn an environment of heightened market uncertainty and volatility, the firm also highlights in its outlook that investors need to consider the portfolio guardrails they have in place to withstand market disruptions.Altaf Kassam, EMEA Head of Investment Strategy and Research, added, ""We believe that the ‘Great Moderation’ period is over, with central banks less likely to backstop markets as they fight inflation and look to reduce their balance sheets. The ‘new normal’ higher-volatility environment should still provide opportunities for equity investors, but it will also likely feature deeper drawdowns and shallower recoveries. Actively managing the risk of the current environment will require effective downside protection strategies.""Peak dollarState Street Global Advisors also thinks that the US dollar, strengthened by rising relative yields and its appeal as a safe haven during a tumultuous time since the end of 2020, will reach its peak and begin to decline in 2023. The firm sees that the most likely outcome is an environment in which ex-US growth narrows the gap with US growth. The firm believes that the transition from inflation to disinflation and a policy shift by central banks to focus on growth will open the door for a broad rally in risk assets, particularly non-US equities.Expiration Date: December 31, 2023Tracking Number: 5326837.1.1.GBL.RTLAbout State Street Global AdvisorsFor four decades, State Street Global Advisors has served the world’s governments, institutions and financial advisors.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. We are pleased to share that we delivered financial performance in the third quarter ahead of the guidance we provided for both the top and bottom line on a non-GAAP basis. Top line results exceeded our expectations on a reported and constant currency basis and the underlying growth, excluding the impact of currency and the Russia-Ukraine exit, was plus 9% in the third quarter, driven by better than expected growth rates for both Tommy and Calvin. Delivering this strong performance in the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges is a testament to our disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan and the strength of our two global brands.We managed our business in a prudent and disciplined manner and underlying revenue growth combined with an increased cost focus drove the outperformance of non-GAAP EPS. Our international businesses continue to execute very well across both brands, with increased product strength and strong consumer engagement driving performance, even in the face of a challenging macro backdrop in Europe and ongoing COVID restrictions in China. And with respect to North America, we are encouraged that our business is starting to show green shoots, although we recognize that we still have work to do to win more with the domestic consumer. We have doubled down on improving our own execution, and this quarter we delivered double digit growth for Tommy and Calvin, led by our D2C stores even against the soft consumer backdrop and intense promotional environment.Given that we're in the middle of the very important holiday season, I've been traveling extensively with our leaders around the world. This past Thanksgiving week, I was with our North American leaders in several of our U.S. markets. Before that, I spent a week in Asia with our leadership team, visiting both Korea and Japan. In a week's time, I'm heading to Europe to spend time with our leaders there. Being out in the markets this holiday season, I feel very good about our performance and the hard work our teams put in to make the PVH+ Plan come to life with the consumer. There is a lot of progress being made, and I want to take the opportunity to say a big thank you to our leaders and teams. Your work is making a big difference. One market visit that stood out over the past few weeks was our visit to Korea.This was my first time returning to Korea after COVID where I could in person experience the strong execution of the PVH+ Plan and our Calvin Klein brand in the market. Calvin in Korea is a great example for how executing the PVH+ Plan will drive strong impacts over time across all regions and markets. In Korea, we have taken the key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan and made them come to life in a uniquely strong way, driving year-to-date revenue growth of plus 22% in local currency. We have accomplished this by leaning into our key product growth categories like underwear, denim, outerwear, big categories where we have the right to play to win. Within each of these, we are then focused on winning with the best hero products in the market, one concrete example being the modern cotton underwear program.We have then connected this strong product focus with some of the strongest talent in the market, like Jenny Kim, HoYeon Jung, to name a few. Finally, we make all these parts come to life on social media and in the consumer experience both online and in stores. The results from executing this, both brand and financial, have been outstanding, generating increasing brand relevance, double digit growth in revenue with significant pricing power and gross margin expansion. Since the PVH+ Plan growth drivers are the same across our brands and all regions, this Korea example is so valuable because it shows how we deliver results through disciplined execution of the plan. As a reminder, our PVH+ Plan is about connecting our two global brands closer to where the consumer is going than any time before through five growth drivers; winning with product, winning with consumer engagement, winning in the digitally led marketplace, developing a demand and data-driven operating model and driving efficiencies while investing in growth.Let me share a brief update on where we are within each of these. In winning with product, our hero product strategy continues to be key to our plan. And we have seen a strong response to our product assortment from both Calvin and Tommy consumers. At Tommy, we're globalizing our strong product assortment developed by Tommy's global product engine based in Europe, building capabilities that deliver products that meet unique local demand across the world. For spring '23, nearly 90% of the assortment as our stores in North America will be aligned with global bestsellers. At the same time for Calvin, we remain focused on doubling down on the key essential products the brand is known for and staying true to the brand's DNA. We are connecting our hero products through winning with consumer engagement.We're connecting our brands together with hero products with culturally relevant talent. For Tommy, we continue to build on our ongoing partnership with Shawn Mendes who is a big fan of the Tommy brand and coupled that with brand heat driving moments such as Tommy's recent fashion show at New York Fashion Week. For Calvin, we're continuing to drive strong consumer engagement through clear product stories centered around hyper relevant talent. We're executing our strategy to win in the digitally led marketplace by building direct-to-consumer connections, led by our own digital business to drive engagement. For example, CK.com in North America recently successfully launched its new platform with enhancements including faster site speed and strong product imagery.In addition, we are focused on fueling high quality growth by working with best-in-class digital partners. With David Savman having just joined the PVH team as our Chief Supply Chain Officer, we are actively working to improve our supply chain and build a demand and data-driven operating model. We are investing in important building blocks to enhance our end-to-end planning capabilities to better match inventory to consumer demand. Lastly, we remain focused on driving efficiencies and investing in growth. As we continue to proactively managing what's within our control, we increased our focus on ensuring that our cost structure matched external demand environment. Through discipline execution, we control our cost which has translated into solid operating margin performance, at the same time enabled us to invest in the PVH+ growth drivers.The PVH+ execution and investments we are making today are building the foundation for long-term growth. This is where we remain intensely focused. Over time, the macro challenges we are navigating today will abate and we will then be in a strong position to further capitalize on improved external conditions. During the third quarter, despite the challenging consumer sentiment, which has become further challenged over the last few months, particularly in North America, we feel good about our team's execution and how well we delivered, a theme we expect to continue for the fourth quarter. So looking ahead, based on our underlying performance trends, we are reaffirming our revenue and EBIT margin guidance and increasing our EPS guidance for the full year, which incorporates our planning for a more promotional environment in the fourth quarter and continued focus on prudently managing our expenses.Our guidance is based on our current view on the macroeconomic environment, and we continue to carefully monitor developments and potential impacts on the consumer for each of the regions in which we operate. We also feel good about the start of the holiday. Through the Black Friday weekend, performance has been in line with our expectations and we are on plan. In Europe where Black Friday has become increasingly irrelevant, we drove strong performance across all channels for both Tommy and Calvin, which include strong increases in traffic. More than ever, great brands such as ours stand out during this important shopping period. And for North America, against the backdrop of soft consumer sentiment and a highly promotional environment, we executed well.We have significantly better in-stock levels versus last year and we saw better conversions in our stores along with some improvement in international traffic. We expect that the strength of our product and better in-stock levels of hero product will continue to support performance in Q4. With respect to leadership for our North America businesses and the Calvin Klein global brand, we are making strong progress on the respective searches and look forward to sharing an update shortly. Now turning to our regional performance and how we are executing our PVH+ Plan across each region, starting with Europe. Both our brands remained strong and continued to resonate with the European consumers with both Calvin and Tommy showing improvements in relevance and consideration compared to last year.Adjusting for the impact of our exit from the Russian market and FX, we generated mid single digit growth on an underlying basis, consistent with our growth in the second quarter and achieved a record €1 billion in revenue for the third quarter. This is on top of very strong growth the prior year. Product elevation remains a key priority with a positive impact on ASPs for Tommy. And for Calvin, we remain focused on growing the CK Lifestyle through elevated commercial collections connected to a strong consumer experience and marketing campaigns. Even as we build on our brand strength, we continue to closely monitor the headwinds in the macro environment and the related impacts to consumer spending, particularly in the UK and Germany where the pressures of high inflation and the energy cost are the greatest.Southern Europe continues to perform very well. Demand in our future order books across brands continue to hold with the spring 2023 season firming up to be high single digit growth on top of double digit growth in spring this past year. Moving on to Asia Pacific. This past quarter, we continued to see strong momentum with all markets demonstrating solid local currency growth. Excluding China, the region demonstrated nearly 30% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 15% headwind from foreign currency. Sales growth was driven by double digit growth in Australia, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. Despite restrictions, we drove mid single digit local currency growth in China. In addition, e-commerce delivered solid double digit growth led by China, Korea and Australia as we continue to expand our presence on the most important digital growth platforms in the region.As I shared in my Korea example earlier, across the region, we are connecting our PVH+ product and consumer engagement initiatives all the way to the stores where we meet the consumer. We saw strong performance for our fall collections and we continue to build brand heat and strong engagement, particularly around key holidays. We're delivering strong hero products, coupled with ongoing locally relevant product collaborations. These efforts are driving strong growth in underwear, led by new silhouettes and functionality; outerwear driven by buy now, wear now transitional products as well as denim fits that resonates with the Gen Z consumer. During the quarter, we drove strong e-commerce performance for key consumer moments such as the Chinese Valentine's Day.And most recently, we delivered double digit GMV and comp growth during China's 11/11 activation, outperforming the industry. Importantly, both Tommy and Calvin gained market share and moved up the rankings on Tmall. In addition, both brands' live streaming events achieved a record 10 million views and each also delivered a record RMB100 million GMV, which very few brands achieve. Our collaborations with Tmall, with product development led by our innovation center on the platform continue to fuel our results. We are leveraging data and insights in these collaborations to quickly be able to read and react and replenish these products to maximize sales. We've also continued to rationalize our assortment to improve SKU productivity and inventory efficiency while simultaneously enabling the region to activate near and onshore product supply chain for speed and margin expansion.We remain excited about the progress and underlying performance in the region and the future whitespace opportunity, particularly digital, which remains underpenetrated. Lastly, for North America, we remain in the early phase of our multiyear journey to unlock the significant opportunity in the region. We are doubling down on driving improved execution through our PVH+ Plan. Most importantly, we're seeing positive performance indicators, especially in our D2C stores, underscoring the effectiveness of the PVH+ execution. As we have moved through the year, even with external challenges, we have driven sequentially improved domestic consumer comps, which returned to pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. In the third quarter, D2C stores delivered double digit positive comps, driven by higher traffic.We continue to make step-by-step progress, starting with product and our assortment. As we shared with you last quarter, we have been allocating more inventory to select doors to showcase the full assortment of our most important hero products. This past quarter, we further scaled our learnings to additional stores with significantly improved inventory levels in these hero product programs and improved in-store experience to generate stronger results. This select group of stores continued to show a very strong sales lift against controlled doors with higher transactions and AURs. For Tommy, our number one category men's Polo significantly improved to achieve 2019 levels during the third quarter. We are seeing a lift as traffic and inventory positioning improves.Our global bestseller initiative which puts the best products from our global design center into North America continued to grow its impact in the third quarter, up from 50% in the second quarter, and we are seeing strong performance from these products. In wholesale, we are deepening the work we do together with our key wholesale partners. We are re-merchandizing doors with improved stock levels, and we will intensify field team coverage and create clearer product presentation. In addition, we're seeing good improvement in on-time delivery. A significantly larger portion of spring orders are projected to be on time compared to the fall and holiday season. Lastly, as we just announced, we're extending our licensing agreement with G-III in North America and we're doing that in a way that over a multiyear time period, step by step, we will transition our business back in-house.We are grateful to G-III for their partnership and long-term commitment to Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and they will continue to be a key partner as we work together over the next few years to internalize the direct operation of these businesses. This is an important long-term step to unlock the full potential of our brands in North America. By bringing these core product categories in-house over time, we will be able to draw on the power and expertise of our global brand teams and have them fully connected to the demand-driven supply chain we are developing. Next, I'll share a few key global brand highlights on how we're bringing both brands to life for the consumer, beginning with Calvin Klein. We have continued to drive strong brand relevance through our exciting brand campaigns, featuring mass aspirational talent for the millennial and Gen Z consumer.In September, we launched Calvins or nothing, a new underwear campaign starring actor Maya Hawke and Belgium professional footballer, Romelu Lukaku. The campaign channels the brand's iconic impactful aesthetic and featured the latest underwear offerings. On Instagram where Calvin has over 22 million followers, the campaign exceeded our expectations and outperformed our engagement rate benchmarks. Most recently, ahead of the World Cup, Calvin Klein taps soccer players; Trent Alexander-Arnold, Antonee Robinson, Kai Havertz, Richarlison and Virgil Van Dijk in the latest installment of the campaign, expanding on the strategy of working with culturally relevant of the moment talent with global appeal. In addition, Calvin Klein Jeans launched a capsule collection and campaign in partnership with leading European online retailer, Zalando.The campaign launched first for Zalando Plus members a loyalty program that gives consumers early access to new releases before becoming available on Zalando, calvinklein.com and Calvin Klein retail stores in key European countries. In Asia, as I mentioned earlier, we leveraged mega talent to drive brand relevance by featuring Jenny Kim, Jessica Jung, HoYeon Jung, Park Seo Joon and others in images that captures the versatile nature of this season's Calvin Klein offerings across the region and increasingly globally. Turning to holiday, we recently launched our curated Gift Guide, which includes iconic styles of underwear and apparel, focused on elevated classics for going out and super soft layers for staying in. In addition to our brand-driven holiday campaign, through our brand ambassadors and collaborators, we will pump out holiday content to drive relevance and engagement throughout this important shopping period.Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger, our marketing initiatives in the third quarter delivered brand heat. Brand campaigns and immersive experiences where the highlight was our return to New York Fashion Week, which kicked off with a multi-verse Tommy Factory Runway experience that launched our new Tommy Hilfiger Monogram collection, and included a star studded guest list, generated global visibility and strong consumer engagement. We generated approximately 6.2 billion impressions from August to October and approximately 27 million social engagements over the same period. The Tommy Factory Runway show ranked the number two on the list of the most talked about shows in New York, generating significant media interest, with the most brand mentions around inclusivity, American, sustainable compared to other top participating brands in the New York Fashion Week.The brand campaign this fall generated 1.1 billion social media impressions and 44 million in organic reach. The TikTok video featuring Tommy Hilfiger is our best performing video on the platform to date. In addition, we generated strong consumer engagement, reaching 14 million followers on Instagram and drove strong engagement on the platform. The brand has seen strong consumer demand following the launch of Tommy Hilfiger Monogram. In Europe, the campaign featuring celebrities such as Kate and Lila Moss, Travis Barker, Jon Batiste and Anthony Ramos drove a higher sell through rate twice that of the rest of the fall collection range, with double digit increases in ASP and very strong retail activations. We saw incredibly strong impressions and share of voice in Asia, North America as well.In addition, as part of the Tommy Hilfiger Monogram collection, the brand collaborated with British designer Richard Quinn on the limited edition capsule, which highlights the refreshed logo and received exclusive Tier 1 retail distribution globally, including French premium retailer . We're excited about our upcoming holiday campaign and collection featuring American iconic stars with distinctive modern aesthetic, inspired by Andy Warhol's factory paying tribute to Warhol's famous parties and the joy of gifts giving during the holiday. The collection is available at Tommy.com, Tommy Hilfiger stores globally and key wholesale partners. And for Tommy Jeans, the label is collaborating with Martine Rose from their Americana inspired capsule collection with modern wardrobe essentials fusing streetwear style with prep details.It's currently available on Tommy.com and Tommy Hilfiger stores globally. For both brands, we're looking forward to an exciting holiday season. In closing, I feel very good about the strong underlying performance we delivered in the quarter that enabled us to beat both our top and bottom line expectations. And I'm confident in our ability to deliver our full year commitments. And we are delivering this despite the macro challenges and volatility we're all navigating through. Looking forward, I'm incredibly optimistic for how in a very disciplined manner through the PVH plan, every quarter we will unlock more and more of the full potential of our two iconic brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger across all our regions leveraged by PVH as a high performing global growth platform.We will be relentless in our execution of this. Before I turn the call over to Zac, I would like to again thank all our associates around the world for your hard work, important contributions this year, and I wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season. I'll now turn the call over to Zac to discuss the financials in more detail.Zac Coughlin: Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased to report strong third quarter results which exceeded our top line guidance by 2%, delivering underlying revenue growth of 9% versus last year and significantly exceeding our earnings guidance with earnings per share of $2.60. We remain laser focused on what is within our control as we continue to navigate a challenging and increasingly complex macroeconomic environment. And that discipline is reflected in our performance for the quarter. Our underlying revenue growth was driven by strong growth across all regions in both our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands.We delivered continued solid performance in our international businesses and sequential improvement in North America, driven by the direct-to-consumer business. On just a reported basis, revenue was down 2%, which reflected a 9% negative impact from exchange and a 2% negative impact from the war in Ukraine. We continue to focus on driving performance in our direct-to-consumer business where we have the closest connection to our consumer and DTC was up high single digits on an underlying basis. On a reported basis, DTC revenue was down 5% compared to last year, which reflected a 10% negative impact from exchange and a 2% negative impact from the war in Ukraine. From a regional perspective, we drove underlying growth across all markets. Third quarter revenue for our international businesses was up 7% versus last year on a constant currency basis, continuing to significantly exceed 2019 pre-pandemic levels.Within our international business, our European business had a record quarter, exceeding €1 billion in revenue for a quarter for the first time ever. Our Asia Pacific business, excluding China, grew nearly 30% compared to last year, even with a negative impact of exchange of 15%. And importantly, we drove mid single digit growth in China in local currency as COVID restrictions there lessened compared to the first half of the year. While we remain optimistic about our business in China, it continues to be a challenging environment as restrictions have once again intensified in the fourth quarter. In North America, revenue in the third quarter was up 10% overall for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein and above our plans, despite the inflation and interest rate pressures that continue to weigh on consumer sentiment in the region.Our North America retail store business was up double digits versus last year, even as we continue to be impacted by the lack of international tourism from Asia. And we drove sequential improvement versus the second quarter as we improved inventory levels in store and grew sales to domestic consumers with our comp base now back to 2019 levels. Our wholesale business was also up double digits versus last year. Our global brands also continued to deliver strong underlying growth with Tommy Hilfiger revenues up 7% on a constant currency basis and Calvin Klein revenues up 9% on a constant currency basis. Reported revenues were down 4% for Tommy Hilfiger and up 1% for Calvin Klein. In the third quarter, we delivered gross margin of 55.9%, up approximately 130 basis points compared to pre-pandemic levels, but down approximately 180 basis points compared to last year.This includes a 40 basis point negative impact of exchange. While gross margin reflected planned price increases, that benefit was more than offset by higher costs and increased promotional selling as inventory levels are elevated across the industry. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter was better than planned at 46.2% and nearly flat to last year. We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, driving cost efficiencies while making targeted investments in strategic areas to fuel growth, in line with the fifth growth driver of the PVH+ Plan. We also took actions this quarter to drive initial progress under the plan we announced last quarter to reduce people cost in our global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023.As a reminder, we expect that once completed, these reductions will generate annual cost savings of over $100 million, with a small benefit to 2022 and increased savings as we move through 2023. In total, our EBIT for the quarter exceeded our guidance due to strong revenue performance and lower expenses. Operating margin was 9.6% as reported and 10%, excluding the negative impact of approximately 40 basis points due to exchange. On a GAAP basis, we also took a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $417 million, which was non-operational and driven by significant increases in discount rates. Earnings per share was $2.60 compared to $2.67 in last year's third quarter and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $0.45, almost entirely driven by the improvement in EBIT.Earnings per share for the quarter also included a $0.35 negative impact compared to the prior year related to exchange and an $0.18 negative impact due to the war in Ukraine. Inventory was up 32% at the end of the quarter compared to the prior year period due to a combination of factors. First, inventory levels were abnormally low last year in all regions and consistent with second quarter, we are normalizing to levels that support our plan to growth. Second, as we've discussed previously, we have increased our inventory investment in core products to mitigate supply chain and logistics disruptions and ensure that we have the right product at the right time. While supply chain and logistics disruptions have not eased entirely, we have begun to see improvements in on-time delivery and decreases in in-transit times.And lastly, inventory levels remain elevated in North America wholesale due to lower than expected demand. At the end of Q2, I mentioned that this was worth about 65 million of the increase in inventory versus the prior year. At this point, we have reduced that amount by nearly a third and are on track with our plan to normalize inventory levels in North America. Additionally, we delivered on our commitment under the PVH+ Plan to return excess cash to shareholders returning over $100 million to shareholders during the quarter through the repurchase of 1.9 million PVH shares and our dividend. Moving on to our outlook. To start with, we are reaffirming the top end of our projected revenue guidance, up 4% on a constant currency basis and our EBIT margin outlook of approximately 9%, and we are raising our full year EPS projection to $8.25.We continue to work relentlessly to drive results even in the face of the challenging macroeconomic environment and trends within the retail industry. Our strong third quarter performance is a testament to our ability to react quickly in the short term, while continuing to be laser focused on strategic actions to support the long-term growth of our business powered by our two global brands, Calvin Klein Tommy Hilfiger. For the full year, we continue to project underlying high single digit revenue growth, in line with our previous guidance. On a reported basis, revenue is projected to be down approximately 3% as reported compared to 2021 and reflects a 7% negative impact from exchange and a 4% reduction resulting from the Heritage Brands transaction, the exit from the Heritage Brands retail business and the war in Ukraine.We expect total digital penetration as a percentage of revenue to be nearly 25%. We expect our full year gross margin rate to remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels, though approximately 130 basis points below record levels in 2021, which includes the negative impact of exchange of approximately 30 basis points. We continue to expect pressure on our gross margin for the remainder of the year due to promotional selling. Overall, we expect gross margin in the fourth quarter will reflect a similar year-over-year decline versus what we reported for the third quarter, as we offset the negative impact of the increasingly promotional environment by driving our higher margin direct-to-consumer channel as a greater share of the business versus last year.We continue to take a disciplined approach to manage expenses across the business in light of increased macro pressures weighing on our gross margin and we are accelerating cost efficiencies while prudently investing in the core pillars of the PVH+ Plan. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year reflects an approximately 60 basis points improvement compared to our previous guidance and is now expected to be approximately 40 basis points higher compared to 2021. Our full year operating margin projection continues to be approximately 9% and reflects a negative impact compared to last year of approximately 40 basis points due to exchange. Our interest expense projection is unchanged at approximately $85 million, and we continue to expect our corporate tax rate will be approximately 24%.For the full year 2022, we are raising our projected earnings per share to be approximately $8.25 compared to our previous guidance of $8.00. The increase versus our previous guidance is primarily due to our strong Q3 performance. Our planned stock repurchase in 2022 remain at approximately $400 million, with approximately 330 million of repurchases completed year-to-date. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting mid single digit revenue growth in our underlying business. On a reported basis, revenue is projected to be down approximately 4% as compared to 2021 and reflects an 8% negative impact from exchange and a 2% negative impact from the war in Ukraine. Fourth quarter earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.65, which reflects the negative impacts of approximately $0.27 due to exchange and approximately $0.15 from the war in Ukraine compared to the prior year.We expect our tax rate in this year's fourth quarter will be an expense of approximately 25%, which is relatively in line with our full year rate expectation. As a reminder, in last year's fourth quarter, we benefited from non-cash tax rate relief tied to our purchase of the Calvin Klein brand back in 2003. This benefit ran out in 2021. As a result, our tax rate in the fourth quarter of last year was a benefit of approximately 33%. We expect our interest expense for the fourth quarter to be approximately $24 million. Before we open it up for questions, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with our strong third quarter results and that we were able to continue to drive strong underlying growth across the business even in the tough macroeconomic environment.We remain focused on driving our strategic priorities despite the continued volatility. Through the PVH+ Plan, our global brands and businesses are well positioned to drive long-term value creation and deliver sustainable profitable growth and shareholder returns. And with that operator, we would like to open it up to questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:16% = US$7.0b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.16 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo begin with, Thermo Fisher Scientific seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 16%. This certainly adds some context to Thermo Fisher Scientific's exceptional 29% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 34% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Thermo Fisher Scientific is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Thermo Fisher Scientific's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 5.8%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 94% of its profits. So it looks like Thermo Fisher Scientific is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, Thermo Fisher Scientific is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 4.7%. Still, forecasts suggest that Thermo Fisher Scientific's future ROE will rise to 20% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to CF Industries Holdings'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CF Industries Holdings is:53% = US$3.8b ÷ US$7.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.53 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.CF Industries Holdings' Earnings Growth And 53% ROETo begin with, CF Industries Holdings has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 18% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, CF Industries Holdings' considerable five year net income growth of 46% was to be expected.Story continuesWe then compared CF Industries Holdings' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 12% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CF is currently mispriced by the market.Is CF Industries Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?CF Industries Holdings has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 56%, meaning the company only retains 44% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Additionally, CF Industries Holdings has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 21% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for CF Industries Holdings is predicted to decline to 31% despite the anticipated decrease in the payout ratio. We reckon that there could probably be other factors that could be driving the forseen decline in the company's ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that CF Industries Holdings' performance has been quite good. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable.

You can skip our detailed analysis on dividend investment and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Low-Risk Dividend Stocks to Invest In. The stock market has been rocky throughout this year, making investors anxious about the outlook of the financial situation. The S&amp;P 500 is down 17.83% year-to-date through December 7, and analysts are predicting more volatility in the upcoming months, possibly leading to a recession. In these times, investors tend to minimize risks of potential losses by prioritizing low-risk investments.Dividend investment is considered a safe option in the current economic landscape as these securities have historically outperformed the broader market with less volatility. According to a report by Fidelity, high-dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during the last two bear markets. The report also mentioned that dividends have accounted for nearly half of the total returns of the S&amp;P 500 over the past 30 years.This year’s returns have also exhibited the strong performance of dividend stocks over other asset classes. The Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index is down by just 0.95% year-to-date, which is very mild considering the broader market’s returns. Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, spoke to Barron’s in December about the overall performance of dividend stocks. He said that during periods of slow economic growth, investors load up on dividend stocks because of their defensive qualities. He further mentioned that dividend strategies are expected to outperform in 2023 as well, with high dividend growth companies stealing the limelight. Senyek named the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index one of his favorite plays, as the companies in the index are mainly known for their consistent dividend growth.Some dividend stocks that are popular amongst investors this year include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).

If you look at the really high-end television sets, they've slowed down. I think right now people are very, very value-conscious. They're always value-conscious, but I think more so now than ever.""Costco CFO Richard Galanti to Yahoo Finance:""Look, over the last six or eight months as there's been inflation and concerns of recession, my answer is: It rains on everyone, maybe it drizzles on us, not hard rain, And so we've done a little better than our peers. This [month] was a slight downtick in those numbers. I've been through this rodeo many times over 38 years.

Comparable sales is known so what really matters is margin. We know that non-foods have been a bit weaker as of late, which we believe may have driven some gross margin pressure from a mix shift to consumables (as we have seen at others like Dollar General and Family Dollar). We estimate gross margin of 10.6% vs consensus of 10.8%. Based on the stock’s recent move lower, some of this gross margin risk has likely been getting priced in. Based on Citi’s quant analysis, Costco is the most crowded stock within our universe, which always makes for a tough setup going into earnings, requiring a near perfect quarter In the case of Dollar General (another crowded stock within our universe), we saw that the less than perfect quarter pressured the stock.""Story continuesCFRA retail analyst Arun Sundaram (hold rating on Costco's stock):""Costco reports fiscal first quarter results on Dec. 8. In addition to weakening discretionary sales, we think Costco could face margin pressure from elevated supply chain costs (retailers have been receiving inventory earlier than expected), greater promotional activity, and higher wages.""More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

First one is just opportunities to manage the business better in all the kinds of ways that we do in retail. Maybe more strategically, there’s a productivity opportunity with automation, particularly in our supply chain and how that will affect store operations in particular. And then thirdly, the business model is changing.”McMillon took the helm at Walmart in 2014 and has taken what was the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer and made it into much more of a hybrid, with better e-commerce, a marketplace and interests in finance and health care.“The thread that you move through as you build a first-party e-commerce business and then a marketplace and then fulfillment services and then add income and then other forms of data monetization creates an opportunity to have higher margins and change the margin mix of the business so that we’re more resilient and more profitable at the same time,” McMillon said. “That work is underway. We’re making some progress as it relates to that. Hopefully, you’ve noticed that in our results.”But underneath those new connections, Walmart still has a huge retail business, which took a big hit earlier this year as inflation not seen in 40 years clamped down on shoppers, whom in some cases had to choose food over discretionary purchases like fashion.Story continuesThe pressure has continued, although Walmart has worked through much of its excess inventory.“This Christmas, if you look at a top-line point of view, we’ll look better because of inflated dollars than it actually is,” McMillon said. “If you look at units and kind of the quality of the breadth of what sells at retail as a retailer, we won’t feel great about the quality of this Christmas.”But Walmart has been pulling in more higher-income consumers — as often happens when times get tougher — and the CEO said it has new tools to hold on to them.“What’s different now is we’ve got this bigger e-commerce business, 370 million items on the U.S. marketplace,” McMillon said. “We’ve got an app. We’ve got pickup. We’ve got delivery. We’ve got Walmart+. We added Paramount+ to it. So there are other things in place that were not in place in the last cycle that we hope will help us retain more customers.”If all of that — plus Sam’s Club and a big international business — sounds like a lot of moving parts, it is. But McMillon said the company has in other ways simplified.“We exited Brazil, the U.K., Japan, Argentina, that’s happening,” he said. “If you look at our business, our portfolio, we’re actually in a different set of businesses than we were a few years ago.“We kind of subtracted and then we added back a tremendous growth opportunity in India with financial services and an e-commerce marketplace business, which as we said when we bought it, would put pressure on earnings for a while. And it has. But every time we raise money for those businesses, the valuation has gone up,” he said. “And it looks like a really good business, not only from an investment point of view but just from an operational point of view.”]"
31,63acc35f-4b78-3417-b87f-09be3df09155,WMT,2022-12-08,Walmart (WMT) Is Up 0.10% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-0-10-one-170005288.html,1670432405,STORY,['WMT'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Walmart (WMT), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Walmart currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for WMT that show why this world's largest retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor WMT, shares are up 0.1% over the past week while the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry is up 1.4% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.97% compares favorably with the industry's 4.69% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Walmart have risen 10.85%, and are up 8.18% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 1.22% and -12.77%, respectively.Investors should also take note of WMT's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, WMT is averaging 7,671,320 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with WMT.Over the past two months, 15 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost WMT's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.84 to $6.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 4 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that WMT is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Walmart on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the mall industry in the US and go directly to 5 Largest Shopping Malls in the United States.The State of the Mall IndustryThe shopping-mall industry in the US grew exponentially from the 50s as suburban life took hold of the country, raising the demand for local shopping centers. Fast-forward to the 21st century, the Internet ushered the US into the age of online shopping, where you can find and buy pretty much whatever you want from the comfort of your couch. This has led to a decline in the shopping-mall appeal. The decline was accelerated during the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 when online shopping grew by 43% according to the US Census Bureau. While shopping malls are still one of the major players in the US retail market, online shopping is projected to account for a third of all retail shopping by 2030, per Kearney, a global management consulting firm. On the other hand, The mall vacancy rate has risen to 8.3% as of Q4 2021, according to data from Statista. This has left the mall REITs with the choice to either evolve or die out. Rate-Hike OnslaughtTo make matters worse, rising interest rates in the US to counter inflation are expected to drive many retailers out of business. Rate hikes are making it harder for consumers to spend money, which is driving the demand for retail goods down. In addition, many retailers had tapped into revolving credit facilities in 2020 to stay in business during lockdowns. The amount these companies borrowed accounted for $145 billion of the $252 billion of total credit, and a significant portion of this amount was variable-rate debt, which is expected to be paid back in the next five years. This means that many retailers would be paying their debt with rising interest rates, at a time when consumers are shopping less. It represents a real risk of driving many retailers out of business, which is further expected to increase the mall vacancy rate through the next five years. Additionally, it’ll make it harder for the survivors to expand their presence in shopping malls. Story continuesFuture of Shopping MallsThe situation on the ground doesn’t look good for shopping mall REITs, but there are ways around irrelevance in the long-term future. According to a Reuters report, Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), the biggest mall-owning REIT in the US, is in talks with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to turn its vacant Sears and J.C. Penney stores into fulfillment centers. Many other shopping malls in North America and Europe are turning towards logistics as the answer to their decreasing revenue in retail. Apart from rising demand for warehouses, logistics also carries financial benefits. The space for retail costs on average $20 per square foot, while the same for warehouse space is only $6.5.Another way the shopping-malls are adapting is by moving more and more towards facilities that are experience-oriented, like event organization, art galleries, cinemas and museums.Now that we know the state of the mall industry, let’s head towards the list of 25 largest shopping malls in the United States.25 Largest Shopping Malls in the United StatesOur MethodologyFor our list of the 25 largest shopping malls in the United States, we’ve ranked them based on their total retail space in square feet.

It is the third spill of several thousand barrels of crude on the pipeline since it first opened in 2010.The 622,000 barrel-per-day Keystone line is a critical artery shipping heavy Canadian crude from Alberta to refiners in the U.S. Midwest and the Gulf Coast. It is unclear how long the closure will last.There have been no effects on drinking water wells or the public, the U.S Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement, though surface water of Mill Creek was affected.Kellan Ashford, spokesperson for EPA Region 7, which includes Kansas, said the cause of the leak was still unclear on Thursday evening.TC had mobilised around 100 people to respond to the spill, while the EPA had dispatched two coordinators, Ashford said. Washington County Emergency Management and Kansas's Department of Health and Safety were also on the scene.Keystone shut the line at about 8 p.m. CT Wednesday (0200 GMT Thursday) after alarms went off and system pressure dropped, TC said in a release. It said booms were being used to contain the spill.The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) ordered the pipeline to remain shut until the regulator authorizes a restart, it said in a statement late Thursday. In addition, Keystone will have to operate at a lower pressure in the affected segment of the line when it is restarted.LARGEST ONSHORE SPILL IN YEARSAccording to PHMSA data, this would be the largest crude oil leak since a Tesoro pipeline leaked more than 20,000 barrels of oil in North Dakota in October 2013.Story continuesPHMSA is also investigating the leak, which occurred near Washington, Kansas, a town of about 1,000 people.There have been seven Keystone spills since it became operational in June 2010, according to PHMSA data. The largest were in December 2017, when more than 6,600 barrels spilled in South Dakota, according to PHMSA figures.“It is troubling to see so many failures and so much oil spilled from any pipeline, but it is especially troubling from such a relatively new pipeline,” said Bill Caram, executive director of the nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust, in a statement.The spill comes about two months after TC said it would temporarily increase capacity on the system to test certain operations. TC has a special permit to operate Keystone at a higher stress level than other U.S. crude lines, according to a 2021 Government Accountability Office report.LENGTH OF SHUTDOWN UNCLEARTC declared force majeure over the outage, according to a source with direct knowledge, referring to unexpected external circumstances that prevent a party to a contract from meeting its obligations. TC did not respond to a request for comment.Two Keystone shippers said TC had not yet notified them how long the pipeline may be shut.Keystone's shutdown will hamper deliveries of Canadian crude both to the U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma and to the Gulf, where it is processed by refiners or exported.The shutdown is expected to increase the discount on Western Canada Select (WCS) heavy oil from Alberta to U.S. crude, which was already high due to lackluster demand for heavy, sour Canadian oil.WCS for December delivery traded at $33.50 a barrel below WTI, compared with Wednesday's settle of $27.50 a barrel below the benchmark, according to one broker.""It's really a worst-case scenario if this outage is long-lasting,"" said Rory Johnston, founder of energy newsletter Commodity Context, noting that if the price falls further, shippers may opt to move crude by rail.In addition, heavy Gulf Coast grades and Latin American grades may see their prices spike, analysts said.Steele City is roughly the junction where Keystone splits, with one segment moving crude to Illinois refineries and the other carrying oil south to Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast.If the spill is located south of the junction, TC may be able to quickly restart the segment to Illinois, RBC analyst Robert Kwan said in a note.Past shutdowns have generally lasted about two weeks, but this could last longer as it involves a water body, Kwan said.TC shares ended down 0.1% in Toronto.(Reporting by Arpan Varghese, Brijesh Patel, Ashiths Shivaprasad and Deep Vakil in Bengaluru, Rod Nickel, Nia Williams and Arathy Somasekhar; Editing by David Gaffen, Josie Kao and Stephen Coates)]"

It plans to cut it further by 25% by 2025.He said the company continues modernisation of the plant following the launch of a deep oil refining complex earlier this year. Next year, Gazprom Neft plans to install a primary refining complex at the plant with capacity of 8.4 million tonnes per year.According to Vedernikov, the Omsk refinery is also working on production of the needle coke. The project is expected to start working in 2024.Needle coke is the main raw material used in the electrodes that producers say can take up to six months to make with processes including baking and rebaking to convert the coke intographite.(Writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)]"

Goldman Sachs predicted prices for the metal could hit a record $11,000 a tonne in a year.""The realization that China is going to be back online and producing product will help bring down inflation and that's a good thing.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled at $71.46 a barrel, shedding 55 cents, or 0.8%.Canada's TC Energy said it shut its 622,000 barrel-per-day Keystone pipeline, which is the primary line shipping heavy Canadian crude from Alberta to the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast, after a spill into a Kansas creek.The line has had several spills since it began operating in 2010.Oil prices rose after the company announced the closure, but the rally dissipated as analysts noted that the U.S. Gulf is likely to have enough inventory to handle short-term outages.

This has lagged the Finance sector's gain of 3.08% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.7% in that time.Morgan Stanley will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 17, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Morgan Stanley to post earnings of $1.43 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 31.25%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $12.36 billion, down 14.87% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.44 per share and revenue of $53.26 billion. These totals would mark changes of -21.65% and -10.87%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Morgan Stanley. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Dips, Albeit Not by MuchBy James RubinIn soccer World Cup terms, bitcoin's performance the past 10 days would be the equivalent of a 0-0 draw.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization isn't losing or gaining much ground. On Wednesday, BTC was recently trading at about $16,850. That was down more than 1% over the past 24 hours but didn't offer much variance from its perch since late November when bitcoin established support above $17,000.In an interview with CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" TV program, Joe Orsini, vice president of research at digital asset management platform Eaglebrook Advisors, attributed bitcoin's toughness to an at least temporary slowdown in bad news stemming from the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and other crypto fiascos this year.""When it comes to the unexpected, no news is good news,"" Orsini said. ""We've had a few things play out since the FTX news, of course, the BlockFi bankruptcy that was relatively priced in knowing they kind of relied on that FTX-Alameda bailout, as well as now you have concerns with some of the lenders. But it's been slow to play out, and there hasn't been that second wave of shock.""Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,230, off 2.8% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red, albeit not by much, as investors continued to gnaw on recent economic indicators suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy had not taken as big a bite out of inflation as was hoped. SUSHI, the token of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap was recently off more than 8%, while popular meme coin DOGE fell more than 3.5%.Story continuesThe CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, tumbled 1.59%.Cryptos roughly tracked U.S. equity markets, which were most down, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 dropping 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, amid inflationary fears, although stocks performance improved over the steeper drops of the previous two days. Markets received an extra whiff of encouragement on Wednesday when China announced it was dropping its harshest Covid restrictions. China's measures to limit mortalities from the disease have been slowing the economic growth of the world's second largest economy by GDP.Eaglebrook Advisors' Orsini said that additional contagion could unsettle markets. ""The important thing to consider is if the news does come, and if there is real contagion, does it lead to forced selling or liquidations or stronger selling pressure?"" he asked, although he remained upbeat about a crypto rebound.""Price does have a knack for changing sentiment,"" he said. ""When things are on sale, people want them less. We believe in the long run that these event-driven declines have very little meaning to underlying technology. Bitcoin has specific characteristics that it a really attractive form of money, and potentially to take market share away from fiat.

An unknown amount was then contributed by SBF himself.These events will complicate FTX and Alameda’s process in their bankruptcy hearings, says Stephen Chan, a partner at Hong Kong-based law firm Ince.“If they are in a partnership, all partners share in the upside and the downside,” Chan said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The other partners may incur liability for the actions of SBF and Alameda.”A material amount of Alameda’s balance sheet was made up of FTX’s FTT token, as CoinDesk previously reported, which it used for collateral on investments. If Alameda funded part, or all, of its contribution to Sino Global’s Liquid Value fund via FTT, then this pool of assets – and whatever they were invested in – would be a part of what’s available to creditors.If it turns out that SBF and his cohorts were committing fraud and some of SBF’s partners were in knowing receipt of proceeds of fraud, Chan explained, there would be a slightly different route under Hong Kong common law (the fund is domiciled there, and FTX/Alameda had a significant presence in the territory).“If SBF is a general partner, then the partnership may have liability,” Chan said.In instances of fraud, liquidators working on the FTX-Alameda case may look to recipients of proceeds of fraud to see whether civil recovery is possible.But all of this might be challenging, to say the least. Sino Global is heavily invested in Solana and its respective infrastructure.CoinGecko data shows that Solana has suffered a 93% loss during the last year, and in the weeks following FTX’s collapse nearly $700 million in locked-in value has been wiped out from Solana decentralized finance protocols.The token of Orca, a Solana-based decentralized exchange that is one of Sino Global’s leading portfolio companies, reached a high of $20 in October 2021; it is now worth just over 40 cents. Its total value locked went from $1.4 billion at its height to $43.15 million today, according to DeFiLlama.FTX’s FTT token is currently trading at $1.51, up 14% during the last two weeks, but down 95% on the month. Recently, its contract deployer has dumped the entirety of the locked FTT tokens into circulation, effectively flooding the market with what is already a token of questionable value.Important events8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC) Australia Trade Balance (MoM/Oct)8:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:00 UTC) European Central Bank's President Christine Lagarde Speech9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Initial Jobless ClaimsCoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Dips Under $17K; Sam Bankman-Fried Hires Attorney Mark Cohen: ReportFormer FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has hired high-profile defense attorney Mark Cohen, the same attorney who represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex-trafficking trial, according to Reuters.

Economists said the reading pointed to elevated labor costs and inflation staying high, adding pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep raising rates.But benchmark U.S. yields and the dollar both fell, suggesting lower rates ahead.""Slower rate hikes have been the trend globally of late, but the Fed remains a wild card. Overall, it's a fickle, anxious market ahead of next week's Fed meeting,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Convera in Washington.The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq fell, adding to the prior day's sell-off on warnings by three major U.S. banks of a looming recession. Questions about how sticky inflation might be have raised uncertainty about the Fed's policy path as the pace of future inflation remains unknown.""Looking back in previous decades of high levels of inflation, it usually takes a few years for inflation to moderate,"" said Chris Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton Vance in London.MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.42%, while the broad European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.62% to mark its fourth straight decline as fears of a global recession intensified.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.19% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.51%.Many in the market believe inflation is moderating and bond yields have peaked, allowing central banks to begin slowing rate hikes when policy-makers from the Fed, Bank of England and European Central Bank meet next week.Story continuesThe Bank of Canada signaled on Wednesday that its historic tightening campaign was near an end as it raised benchmark overnight interest rates by 50 basis points to 4.25%, the highest level in almost 15 years.Earlier, the Reserve Bank of India slowed the pace of rate increases with a 35 basis point hike of its key lending rate to 6.25%, but warned inflation could remain pervasive and elevated.Fed Chair Jerome Powell also has warned the fight against inflation is far from over, but late last month he said the Fed could ease the pace of its rate hikes as soon as December.Powell's comments have led the market to price in a lower peak interest rate, which Fed funds futures showed on Wednesday to be 4.918% next May, down from recent highs above 5.1%. Futures show the terminal rate at 4.419% in December 2023.The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell 9.2 basis points to an almost three-month low of 3.421%. But the inversion of two- and 10-year note yields, a recession harbinger, deepened at -84.5 basis points.Gold prices rose, helped by a retreat in the dollar and Treasury yields, as investors anticipate the projection of slower rate hikes at the Fed's meeting on Dec. 13-14.U.S. gold futures settled 0.9% higher at $1,798 an ounce.The dollar slipped as traders weighed up an uncertain economic outlook, while China's yuan firmed as authorities loosened some of the country's zero-COVID rules.The euro gained 0.37% to $1.0508, and the yen strengthened 0.44% to 136.45 per dollar.China's national health authority said asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and those with mild symptoms can self-treat while in quarantine at home, the strongest sign so far that Beijing is preparing to live with the disease.Market reaction was negative as the focus shifts to how well China can execute its policy shift.""It is difficult to assume that China's reopening will not be inflationary when the opposite was true for the rest of the world and that will be the challenge heading into 2022,"" said Geoff Yu, strategist at BNY Mellon.Oil slid to its lowest since the start of the year in volatile trading after U.S. government data showed an unexpectedly large build in fuel stocks, feeding fears about demand in a market already spooked by an uncertain economy.U.S. crude fell $2.24 to settle at $72.01 a barrel, while Brent settled down $2.18 at $77.17.(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Danilo Masoni in Milan; Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by John Stonestreet, Nick Zieminski and David Gregorio)]"

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Gensler, who declined to specifically talk about failed crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said in an interview on Yahoo! Finance that the SEC has the basic disclosure and governance requirements in place to hold digital-assets firms accountable.The SEC chief also didn’t directly address questions about whether his agency would push out tailored crypto rules next year, but he insisted that it doesn’t need any. “The rules are there,” he said. “The law firms know how to advise their clients to comply.”FTX’s crash showed the dangers of running a global platform without walls between customer funds and investment operations, Gensler said. Crypto firms can’t do everything. “Your field will not last long outside of public policy norms,” he said.The court case over whether Ripple’s XRP is a security has been seen as the major lingering question holding the agency back, but Gensler said Wednesday that a federal judge’s decision last month determining that crypto startup LBRY violated securities laws by selling its native LBC tokens was a “very big win” for the SEC’s legal campaign.So far, the SEC hasn’t directly gone after U.S. exchange Coinbase (COIN) for listing what the agency believes are securities without registering as a national securities exchange. Still, the SEC has – in another recent enforcement action – listed several tokens it considers unregistered securities that were traded on the company’s platform.Token Roundup(CoinDesk Research)Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,800, down about a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has held comfortably above $17,000 for much of the past nine days, despite ongoing investor jitters about contagion linked to the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly signs since late last week that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to maintain its hawkish course on interest rate hikes through 2023.Story continuesSushiSwap (SUSHI): The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is facing a significant deficit in its treasury that threatens its long-term operational viability, according to a governance proposal from project developers. After reviewing expenditures, the project's annual runway requirement was reduced from $9 million to $5 million, but the treasury still provides for only about 18 months of runway, developers said.Axie Infinity (AXS): The native token of the blockchain-based play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, has come out of oblivion this week with a double-digit price rally. Yet, leverage traders appear skeptical if AXS' turnaround from 17-month lows would be longlasting. That's because while open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active standard futures and perpetual futures contracts tied to AXS, has increased to a three-month high of $129.70 million, funding rates remain negative, according to data source Coinglass.Latest PricesCoinDesk Market Index (CMI)850.81 −11.4 ▼ 1.3%  Bitcoin (BTC)$16,814 −174.0 ▼ 1.0%  Ethereum (ETH)$1,230 −25.5 ▼ 2.0%  S&amp;P 500 daily close3,933.92 −7.3 ▼ 0.2%  Gold$1,799 +29.4 ▲ 1.7%  Treasury Yield 10 Years3.41% ▼ 0.1  BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price.

If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter. Increased short-term rates and slower economic growth lead to lower demand and prices for physical and digital assets.10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Constant Maturity (Fred Database)Read the full technical take here.Other NewsCoinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brian Armstong said the company’s revenue will be about half what it was last year as the crypto exchange struggles amid stark price drops in cryptocurrencies and continuing ripple effects from multiple bankruptcies this year, including the recent collapse of rival exchange FTX. Armstrong noted in an interview with Bloomberg’s David Rubenstein that Coinbase had done about $7 billion in revenue ($7.8 billion, according to FactSet) and $4 billion in positive EBITDA. “It's looking, you know, about roughly half that or less,” Armstrong said.Genesis interim CEO Derar Islim wrote in a letter to customers Wednesday that resolution of his company’s lending unit’s withdrawal freeze is likely to be a matter of “weeks” rather than days. The lending arm of Genesis in November was forced to suspend redemptions following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. This morning’s note from Islim said Genesis is committed to being as “transparent as possible” with customers and that it is working in consultation with highly experienced advisers and in close collaboration with its owner, Digital Currency Group.

I just want to come back to how great it was to see so many of you at Dreamforce in September. It was really a wonderful experience for me personally. It was our most successful, but I really think it was our most important Dreamforce ever, because we were able to come together for what we called our great reunion. And being with you all of you, especially at our IR day, that was a joy for me. Now let's get on to the quarter results. We delivered solid revenue growth and profitability in an increasingly challenging environment. You've seen how we're driving customer success, the strength of our organic innovation and this incredible Trailblazer community and how it manifested at the Dreamforce.And everywhere we turn, we saw customers learning how to connect with their customers in entirely new ways and the depth of our Customer 360 platform. We're also thrilled to introduce Genie, which is our Customer Data Cloud, and it's one of the most transformational technologies we have ever delivered. And when you hear some of the metrics already coming out of customer adoption with Genie, I think that you'll be incredibly impressed, and I can't wait for Bret to talk about that. The best part of Dreamforce was being together. That was what it was all about for me, and I'm sure it was for you as well, and the 40,000 folks that all came to San Francisco to have this incredible experience and all the additional folks that joined us online. Now let's get to our results.Revenue in the quarter, well, it was $7.84 billion. That's up 14% year-over-year. I think that's a record for us. And also, it was 19% in constant currency. And we're going to talk about that foreign exchange situation in just a second. We closed some amazing deals in the quarter with great companies like Bank of America, RBC Wealth Management and Dell and other great stories, and I'm also going to get that into a moment as well. And even with purchase decisions receiving greater scrutiny, we continue to gain market share and close marquee transactions. IDC recently ranked Salesforce as the number one in CRM. And now we've done that for nine years in a row. And I'm proud that we've delivered revenue growth in this environment, but especially proud of the team for our continued focus on delivering record operating margins.And here, you can see now, up 22.7% non-GAAP operating margin we delivered for the quarter. And I think when I look back at various financial crisis, as we think back even, I think, to 2008, 2009, I think it was like somewhere down to 10%. So we've come a long way in a short period of time. So this quarter has been further proof of our commitment to profitable growth, continuing our operating margin growth, continued focus on our revenue growth, continued focus on our market share growth. And a great evidence of that is our remaining performance obligation. Our RPO is now an incredible $40 billion. Now, as I've said in the last few quarters, the dollar had a strong quarter, maybe even a stronger quarter than we had. I think that when we first said that, in the second quarter, folks didn't really understand what we were talking about, or maybe it wasn't the first quarter we said that.I remember, it was a trip to Japan when I called Amy, and I was asking her what the expectations were for revenue. But when I told her what my guidance was for what and how I was looking at revenue, including foreign exchange, I don't think either one of us could believe what was really happening, and now we've really seen that start to play out. We continue to see the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. And of course, that is our biggest surprise of the year. In the quarter, we saw $300 million year-over-year headwinds to revenue, and we've expected a total of $900 million for the full year. Now that is something we just could not have expected a year ago, and that is when we initiated our revenue guidance. At Dreamforce and in my travels around the world, our customers have been asking how to best navigate this economic situation with the high level of market volatility and uncertainty.A lot of CEOs have never been through these types of crisis before. They haven't seen these kind of variations in the market or in foreign exchange or even in market demand. Well, we've got a lot to say about that, because this is not our first financial crisis. And I'm seeing a lot of buying behavior that really reflects a lot of what we've seen during other crisis, whether it's 2008, 2009 or even 2001. And obviously, the current economic situation is nowhere near as severe as what happened beginning in 2008, but there are some patterns that we've seen repeat themselves. And in early 2008, we saw customers who are reluctant to expand distribution capacity, they weren't adding service people, they froze their hiring, they initiated headcount reductions.We saw those occur in that year. We saw that in (ph) as well. I think that, maybe when things start to get a little tough or when the stock market shifts that's when CEOs say, hold on, should we be expanding distribution capacity right now? Should we be expanding service capacity? What do we stop -- let's stop our advertising, let's stop our marketing spend, things that they can immediately take actions on. Well, you couple that with foreign exchange headwinds have become an issue and everyone was shifting their focus to finding efficiencies, reducing their costs, increasing productivity, and again, we're feeling all of this once again. And that led us to the shift of the company. It took us a lot to how we operate and where we are investing our dollars.We've actually developed our own playbook. We really wrote it all down. We talked about what was happening we knew would happen again. And we had to dust off some of those plans and numbers from 12, 13 years ago from 22 years ago. And we've turned that playbook in gaining market share and focusing on operational discipline and operational excellence, especially in the face of economic headwinds. And as the economy has started to recover, whether it's in 2010, or even in 2002, we were able to radically accelerate our growth. I have to tell you, when we went back as a team and we looked at the numbers, even I was really shocked to see kind of how things change some of the decisions that we made, but then how we all of a sudden were able to navigate so well, and use that as an opportunity to adjust the company in all -- in a number of really critical and strategic areas.Now I've always believed since that point, especially, that an economic crisis creates these opportunities, and we're squarely in that moment, and we've acted. Starting in July of this year, the buying environment became more measured and foreign exchange headwinds were becoming increasingly complex. We told you then we didn't believe this challenging macro environment was going to be a short-term problem. And you know we're not economists. You know that we don't know exactly what is happening or when the recovery will happen, et cetera, but we do see a lot, and I think we understand a lot about what's going on, because we have such strong global data. And we're not assuming that this economy gets any better anytime soon. We're just reporting what we see with our customers, the kind of changes they make, when they start to feel these headwinds.We're following our playbook to make sure we're well positioned to gain market share, to increase our profitability, to focus on our operating margin, to focus on the growth of our revenue and be able to continue to invest, especially when the economy recovers. Now for this fiscal year, we're maintaining our revenue guidance of $30.9 billion to $31 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. And you saw that, that also included that incremental foreign exchange headwind, and it's even an expected incremental $100 million of foreign exchange headwind just since last quarter. We're raising our fiscal year 2023 non-GAAP operating margin guidance from 20.4% to 20.7%, an expansion of 200 basis points year-over-year, and I expect a lot more, especially with this increased focus we have on expanding our operating margin.Salesforce is mission-critical to nearly every Fortune 1000 company, because every company is becoming a customer company. And everyone knows that this is the time during a crisis like this that you need to focus on your customers. If you need to do one thing, if there's one critical thing that every company has to do to get through this, is to make sure they maintain their relationships with their customers. It's a critical part of navigating through this time, and you're not going to be successful if you don't stay connected with your customers. We're signing transformational deals with major brands, as every industry continues to digitally transform and that continues to be perhaps the most important initiative of every company, regardless of the economic situation.When you look at this by industry, it's slightly different for each industry. In telecom, we're working with almost every major players. They transform how they connect with their customers. All telcos must deliver faster, better service to customers, keeping their costs down, focusing on their NPS score, becoming more competitive. We all know that. It's a highly competitive industry. We all understand the dynamics well. It's one of the reasons why we've done so well in all these global telecom companies. But I really want to talk to you about a great example, and this deal that we signed with T-Mobile in the quarter. Now we've done a lot of work with Mike and with T-Mobile over the years, and that's been very exciting to see how they built their company and especially how they've executed the merger and now they have a treeing amazing transformational opportunity on how they work with businesses, and we're working with them to develop a vision for the next-generation user experience for T-Mobile for Business and our professional services team is leading that charge.Financial Services, well, that's another industry that's been going through one of the most incredible digital transformations, but it's an incredible moment for them actually. It's why we're working with all the major financial service companies to drive stronger client relationships and to unite their teams to be more effective, especially in this environment. It's a golden time for financial services in many ways. A great example is Bank of America, who I think has been a customer for more than 20 years, and we've been with them through many different financial crisis. But in a short amount of time, they've increased productivity and reduce their technical debt. They're saving time and money, they're connecting with their customers in new base.It's a tremendous relationship with BofA to become their CRM standard. We're delighted to have such great success with them over many decades and to expand this relationship to the business bank, to the corporate bank and the investment bank, it's really an expansion. And I just want to thank Brian for his tremendous loyalty, but also his partnership over so many decades, and it's just a great organization to work with every single day. Well, before I go on, first of all, I want to give you an invitation. I hope that, you'll all plan to join us in New York City next week, where we're going to host our Salesforce world tour on December 8. Join us in person or online, where we're going to announce some new innovations. And you're going to hear from our incredible customers and so much more.Now before I end, I have to say something, and it's something that I did not want to say ever, and I'm extremely sad to tell you that, Bret Taylor is going to be leaving the company. Bret and I are like brothers. I love him very deeply. He's an incredible person. And one of the great joys of my company has been having him here. And I'll tell you, for me, this has been a feeling of tremendous loss. I'm experiencing that right now. You can probably hear it in my voice. It makes me think of all the great people that we have actually lost in the company over the time as well, so many great leaders of our industry, but especially now with Bret. This is just really hard for me, and I'm extremely sad to see him go. I know he has created two great companies.I know he wants to go create a third great company. And you can't keep a wild tiger in a cage. And we got to let them be free and let him go, and I understand, but I don't like it. And Bret, you know that you're always going to be our brother. You know that you -- we love you very deeply, that you have a home here. We're going to try to get you back somehow. So don't think that you're going to somehow get out of this alive, because you're not. And you're always going to be part of our Ohana. And we are really upset about this, and it's going to be a difficult moment for us. But I know that you're going to be with us through the end of the year, and I know you're going to continue to work with us even after this point. But Bret, we love you, and we're so sorry to see you leave the company at the end of this year.Bret Taylor: Thank you, Marc. It's hard to follow that and trying to keep my composure as well. I just want to start, Marc, by just expressing how deeply grateful I am to you. And just as importantly, the entire Salesforce team. For the past six-plus years, I just couldn't have imagined it when I joined the company, I could not be more proud of the trust, innovation and customer success we've delivered in my time here, particularly over the past few years, I think this amazing community has helped every organization in the world to remain connected to their customers amidst a public health crisis, the economic turmoil, this global pandemic. It's just incredible, and I'm incredibly grateful. And Marc, you personally, you've been my mentor long before I joined this company.And in the past six years, your relationship has definitely become the most significant in my professional career. I would not be the leader, I am today without you, and I cannot thank you enough for our friendship and our partnership. The past few years have been tumultuous for all of us, and I've recently been reflecting what's been truly important to me. And while there is absolutely no easy time for a transition like this, I really do feel that now is the right time for me to return to my entrepreneurial roots, particularly given the technology landscape and the economy going through such tectonic shifts. Salesforce has never been stronger, and I've never been more confident in the future of the company. And as Marc said, I will remain as co-CEO through the end of the fiscal year, not only to ensure a smooth transition, but most importantly, to ensure that we have a strong close to the quarter and a strong close to the fiscal year.And as Marc said, even after this transition, I will always, always be a part of this company and always be a part of this community. As Marc said, we had a solid quarter, top -- double-digit top and bottom line performance, demonstrating the strength of our business model and our commitment to operating with discipline and delivering profitable growth at scale. We continue to deliver on organic innovation, and our product portfolio is strategically positioned, mission-critical and highly differentiated. Our ecosystem and our app exchange marketplace are unparalleled in the industry. And as Marc mentioned, as you saw at Dreamforce, our innovation engine is an overdrive, with Genie, Slack canvas, Net Zero Marketplace and more, building on our position as a leader in nearly every CRM category.Genie, in particular, makes every part of our Customer 360 platform more automated, intelligent and real-time, driving faster time to value for our customers. And the adoption of Genie by our customers, particularly this past Cyber week, has exceeded all of our expectations. The Genie Customer Data Cloud is already processing literally over 100 billion customer records on average every single day. During Cyber Week alone, Genie ingested an astonishing 1.1 trillion records and enabled 43 billion consumer engagements for our customers. Inter, a leading digital banking service company in Brazil, is a great example of Genie's power. Inter was able to consolidate six data systems into one, and they are converting 35 times more customers with Genie.Like Marc, I met with hundreds of CEOs across every industry over the last few months. In this buying environment, our customers are increasingly focused on three things. First is time to value. Our customers need to quickly get the benefits of their technology investments. Second is ensuring these digital transformation projects drive cost savings in addition to customer satisfaction and top line growth. And third, we know our customers need to consolidate their platforms and vendor relationships to reduce complexity and risk and to drive efficiency. We are delivering on all three at scale today for our customers. Our customers are seeing on average an estimated 25% in savings in their IT costs and 26% increase in employee productivity using Salesforce according to a recent survey of more than 3,500 of our customers.RBC Wealth Management is a great example. RBC is onboarding new customers in minutes instead of days, and they've consolidated over 26 technology systems into one using our Customer 360 platform, decreasing their maintenance costs by 50%. Despite the economic headwinds that Marc mentioned, we had record low revenue attrition again this quarter, which is a testament to just how mission-critical Salesforce is to our customers, especially in this environment. We also launched new product bundles for sales, service, marketing and analytics. These product bundles are enabling our customers to consolidate their tools on Salesforce, driving efficient growth. We're also closing transformational deals and multi-cloud expansions. This quarter, seven of our top 10 deals included five or more of our clouds.Now let's turn to the cloud performance. Sales Cloud, our flagship, continues to drive sales productivity for the world's most important brands. Sales Cloud grew 12% year-over-year, a healthy 17% in constant currency, including great customer wins at companies like Bolt, Snowflake and Thermo Fisher. Service Cloud continues to help our customers deliver exceptional customer service experiences and reduce their customer service costs. Service Cloud grew 12% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency, approaching $2 billion in revenue for the quarter, with wins at Carl Zeiss, Dell and Fujitsu. Our Marketing and Commerce Clouds power the digital customer experiences for the world's greatest retailers and browns around the world, and together grew 12% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency, thanks to wins at companies like Banco Bradesco, Hugo Boss and Slack.We just passed Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and I want to express my gratitude to our engineering teams. Our engineering teams again delivered unparalleled mission-critical reliability and scale to retailers around the world. Even lapping the pandemic, the sales process for our Commerce Cloud in Cyber Week increased 11% year-over-year. And our Marketing Cloud delivered nearly 49 billion messages in Cyber Week alone, up 21% year-over-year. We've now sent 1.4 trillion messages from our Marketing Cloud so far this year, just incredible. Our platform business, which includes Slack, grew 18% or 22% in constant currency, highlighted by wins at Japan Airlines, WorkSafe, Victoria and Zoom. Einstein Artificial Intelligence platform is now generating 194 billion predictions every single day across the Salesforce Customer 360 platform, up 57% year-over-year.And Slack, which now powers collaboration and workflows across the entire Customer 360, grew 46% year-over-year. Slack is now handling more than 2.6 billion actions every single day and had great wins this quarter with companies like Rivian and Verizon. Data, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau, continues to be core to every digital transformation at every single one of our customers. Data grew 13% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency. We're seeing strong demand from MuleSoft, which reaccelerated in the quarter to 19% year-over-year growth or 23% in constant currency, with wins at brands like Western Union, SmileDirectClub and Kona. Integration transactions on the MuleSoft platform grew to $6.7 billion per day, up 33% year-over-year. Tableau grew at 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency, with wins in the quarter at Inter and McLaren Racing.As a reminder, due to the way we recognize revenue in MuleSoft and Tableau, when the macro environment is difficult, we typically see the effects earlier and more pronounced in these businesses. We're confident in the opportunity ahead for Tableau, and we recently made changes to reaccelerate Tableau growth. This includes new leadership, and as importantly, new product integrations like revenue intelligence, a deep integration between Sales Cloud and Tableau that has become one of our fastest-growing add-on products. And finally, as we mentioned every quarter, our industry solutions continue to be a strength in our portfolio, with out-of-the-box processes that enable our customers to achieve faster time to value and lower implementation costs.Even with the many successes in the quarter, we expect this increasingly challenging buying environment to continue next year. I'm confident that, Salesforce has never been more mission critical to our customers in this environment. And to wrap, I'm so grateful for our employees, our 80 million Trailblazers, and all of our customers and partners for helping lead the way with innovation, agility and resilience to navigate in these times. And before I pass it to you, Amy, I just want to express my personal gratitude to you. As I became the first-time CEO and you became a first-time CFO navigating the company and navigating our customers through these crisis, I'm so grateful for our relationship and for everything this company has done for me.See also Top 15 Infrastructure Companies in the US and 15 Most Capitalist Companies in the World.Amy Weaver: Great. Bret, thank you. And let me just start by saying you, it has truly been a joy to work with you for the last six years. I am going to miss you carefully, but I'm also equally excited for you on your next steps, and I know they will be incredible success again. So taking that left turn to our results here. I am pleased to report another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. Despite increasing macro pressure, revenue grew nearly 20% in constant currency. And as we discussed at our Investor Day in September, it's a new day for profitability. I'm very proud of our Salesforce team and all of our employees for generating record operating margin during Q3. Reiterating Marc's comments, profitable growth is a major focus as we lean in on best-in-class operational excellence across all aspects of our business.As customers focus on optimizing time to value, driving cost savings and consolidating platforms and vendor relationships, we remain well positioned to support them through the current economic environment. Now to our results for Q3 fiscal year 2023, I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the third quarter was $7.84 billion, up 14% year-over-year, or 19% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to be a headwind to our results, as the dollar further strengthened throughout the quarter. For Q3, the total FX impact was $300 million, approximately $50 million more than we had forecast. A few highlights from the quarter. Again, as we outlined at Investor Day, we have three balanced growth pillars: Customer 360 Advantage, industry solutions and geographical expansion.All of these continue to reflect the growing adoption of our portfolio across our customer base. First, multi-cloud adoption by our customer base continues. Customers with five or more clouds increased ARR by over 20%. Second, our industry solution continues to be a strong tailwind to our revenue growth. Seven of our 13 industry clouds grew ARR above 50% this quarter. In some of the highest performing industries, clouds in the quarter included energy and utilities, manufacturing and our recently announced Automotive Cloud. Finally, from a geographical perspective, Americas grew 16% year-over-year, EMEA grew 10%, 23% in constant currency, and APAC grew 14%, which is 30% in constant currency. And as you have heard, revenue attrition in Q3 was again below 7.5%, reflecting the value that our services are providing to the customer base in this tough operating environment.Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was a strong 22.7%, driven by our ongoing focus on disciplined execution, our hiring slowdown and resource prioritization. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.21 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.40. Mark-to-market accounting of the company's strategic investments increased GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by $0.02. Operating cash flow was $313 million in Q3, down 23% year-over-year. CapEx $198 million, resulting in free cash flow of $115 million, down 52% year-over-year, both driven by lower billings. Turning to remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract. RPO ended Q3 at approximately $40 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, was approximately $20.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 15% in constant currency.This includes one point of incremental FX headwinds beyond our Q3 guidance. And finally, Q3 was a milestone corridor for Salesforce. After announcing our first ever share repurchase program on the last earnings call, I am pleased to share that we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders during Q3. Before moving to our guidance, I'd like to comment on the current economic environment. You recall that last quarter we noted measured customer buying behavior really beginning in July. This led to elongated sales cycles, additional deal approval layers and deal compression, particularly in enterprise. As Q3 progressed, we saw an even more challenging buying environment, driving intense customer scrutiny on every investment dollar to ensure the highest return possible.During Q3, this behavior was most pronounced in our US and major European markets, while Japan remains more resilient. From an industry perspective, the most impacted was retail, consumer goods and communications and media, while the more resilient for travel and hospitality, manufacturing, automotive and energy. And from a product perspective, we continue to see customer spending pressure in commerce and marketing. Now to our guidance. First, on revenue, we are pleased to maintain our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance of $30.9 billion to $31 billion representing 17% growth year-over-year or 20% in constant currency despite an incremental $100 million FX headwind since our last call. This raises the total year-over-year FX headwind to $900 million.In addition, our guidance includes flat at slightly above $1.5 billion. As you've already heard, we are deeply committed to expanding our profitability over the long term. I am proud that, we are raising our fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 20.7%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. And this guidance also includes approximately 75 basis points of headwind from Slack. As a reminder, because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same currencies, there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin. For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.35 to $1.37. For the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.55 to $0.57 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.92 to $4.94. CRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be approximately 7% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency.This guidance continues to incorporate the more challenging trends in our customer behavior, as previously discussed. We now expect our fiscal 2023 operating cash flow guidance to be approximately 16%, which is at the lower end of our previous guidance, driven by lower billings. This includes a three-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes, requiring the capitalization certain R&amp;D costs. We now expect CapEx to be approximately 2.5% of revenue for the fiscal year. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 17% for the fiscal year. Before I close, I'd like to share a few thoughts on fiscal year 2024. As discussed, we are experiencing a very unpredictable macro environment as our customers are looking to ensure their businesses are also healthy for the long term.Compounding that dynamic is an unprecedented foreign currency market. Therefore, at this time, we believe it will be pretty sure to provide revenue guidance for the next fiscal year. Now in terms of operating margin, we are driving operating discipline and following our playbook that Marc discussed to ensure that we are consistently expanding our operating margin in the face of top line headwinds. And as the leadership team, we're continuing to take a hard look at our cost structure. This is all part of our playbook, and we will continue to take steps that drive profitable growth. Of note, we intend to provide full FY 2024 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. So to close, we are helping our customers navigate the current macro environment by bringing much needed efficiencies to their digital strategy with a compelling value case.Our commitment to disciplined decision-making is unwavering, and we are marching towards our fiscal 2026 target of at least 25% non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of any capital allocation decision. And as our business grows, we will continue to target returning on average 30% to 40% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders. Now, Mike, should we open up the call for questions.Mike Spencer: That's good. Thank you, Amy. Bo, we'll go to Q&amp;A and we'll take the first question.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
60,5622124c-ef5c-38d7-8458-43b52bce4a79,CRM,2022-12-08,15 Most Creative Companies In The World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-creative-companies-world-144640162.html,1670424400,STORY,"['NTCO', 'TRUMY', 'BMY', 'BAYN.DE', 'INFY', 'GOOGL', 'HINDUNILVR.BO', 'BHEL.BO', 'RBGLY', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'CRM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the fifteen most creative companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Most Creative Companies In The World. While creativity is generally thought to lie in the domain of the arts, it plays a central role in the business world as well. Competition is tough in nearly every industry, even if they are oligopolies like the memory industry since companies have to always stay on the edge and create unique solutions to deliver value to customers and improve their business processes.At an individual level, creativity is measured by psychologists through what are called 'divergence tests'. These tests provide respondents with a variety of questions and then determine how unique the provided answers are. Another tool to measure creativity is the Biographical Inventory of Creative Behaviors (BICB). This tool consists of 34 questions that ask users whether they have carried out different activities over the course of the past twelve months. Shifting towards measuring creativity in the corporate world, Deloitte has some insight into the matter. It refers to a list of subjective assessments that are called consensual assessments. One of these is the Creative Product Semantic Scale (CPSS) which first involves determining the different facets of creativity in products by employing principle components analysis (PCA). This tool, which is also used in artificial intelligence and machine learning, reduces a data set to the set of variables that explain the largest amount of differences. Then, multivariate analysis is used to determine how accurate the CPSS is in determining the levels of, and the differences between, Novelty, Resolution, and Elaboration and Synthesis in the products that are being studied.On the philosophical side, especially when it comes to industries, one of the most popular concepts of creativity is what is termed as Creative Destruction. This concept was introduced by the Austrian philosopher Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 through his book Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. Schumpeter elaborated on Karl Marx's thoughts that were introduced in 1848, and stated that this process is eternal in the business world and is a natural force that caused old industries to die out and become replaced by new ones.Story continuesPhoto by FRANCESCO TOMMASINI on UnsplashIn his own words:The opening up of new markets and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as US Steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one ... [The process] must be seen in its role in the perennial gale of creative destruction; it cannot be understood on the hypothesis that there is a perennial lull.A popular evolution of this concept, particularly in the modern age, comes from the late Harvard University professor Dr. Clayton Magleby Christensen. Dr. Christensen's concept outlines that disruptive innovation is when a company or a product enters a market at the bottom run and then ends up displacing the top performers. He uses the iPhone to explain that when the revolutionary product was launched in 2007, it entered the communications device market. However, the iPhone's true disruption was not because it was a superior product (which Dr. Christensen believes only contributed to its initial popularity) but because it ended up replacing the laptop as the primary means of connecting to the Internet.Today we will look at the companies that are leading on the creative front today, and some of the top picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Our Methodology We consulted Forbes Magazine's list of The World's Most Innovative Companies to sift out the top firms that are leading on the innovation front. As a side note, while innovation and creativity are often thought of as synonymously, they are slightly different. While creativity is the idea generation process, innovation calls for putting this idea into practice. In essence, while all creativity is not innovation, all innovation is indeed creativity.Most Creative Companies In The World15.

As part of this strategic collaboration, SEE will buy the Highcon Beam 2C system that will be delivered and installed in the first quarter of 2023. Sealed Air will invest $8 million in the form of convertible debt and 15% warrants that must be converted at 3.1 NIS per share before five years from the date of the deal. Additionally, Sealed Air will be granted warrants of up to $20 million against possible future purchases of Highcon's products and services over a period of three years. Sealed Air and Highcon teams have been working together for the past few months to investigate how the latter’s products and technology might be applied to SEE and its activities. Highcon’s talent, technologies and culture left a mark on SEE. Sealed Air will largely benefit from Highcon’s digital paperboard converting and laser cutting capabilities. Highcon's sustainable value proposition will aid SEE’s vision and strategies for the future. Highcon, on the other hand, will gain from Sealed Air’s global reach. With the help of this alliance, Highcon will be able to enter new application spaces. In the last reported quarter, SEE’s results were positively impacted by pricing actions and productivity improvements. However, foreign currency headwinds, continued cost inflation, and slowing demand proved to be a challenge. The company reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of 98 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents. This compares favorably with the prior’s year’s reported earnings of 86 cents. Revenues for the quarter totaled $1,400 million, flat with the year-ago quarter. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,470 million. To reflect the third-quarter results, Sealed Air lowered its net sales guidance to the range of $5.65 billion to $5.75 billion, down from its earlier provided range of $5.85 to $6.05 billion. Currently, the company expects its adjusted earnings to range from $4.05 to $4.15 per share. This has been narrowed from the previously stated earnings per share range of $4.05 to $4.20.Story continues On average, the company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.7%.Price PerformanceSealed Air’s shares have lost 18.1% in a year's time compared with the industry’s decline of 0.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSealed Air currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Hubbell HUBB, Tenaris TS and W.W.

63,1b470aed-146d-3f38-9264-a169033b106f,PCG,2022-12-08,"At US$15.43, Is PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-15-43-pg-e-153700213.html,1670427420,STORY,['PCGU'],"[PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on PG&amp;E’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for PG&amp;E What Is PG&amp;E Worth?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that PG&amp;E’s ratio of 17.44x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 19.18x, which means if you buy PG&amp;E today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe PG&amp;E should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that PG&amp;E’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of PG&amp;E look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. PG&amp;E's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 65%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in PCG’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at PCG? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PCG, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for PCG, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing PG&amp;E at this point in time. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for PG&amp;E (1 is potentially serious!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.If you are no longer interested in PG&amp;E, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 8.91%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.7%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Microsoft as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Microsoft is projected to report earnings of $2.28 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 8.06%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $52.93 billion, up 2.32% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.54 per share and revenue of $212.38 billion. These totals would mark changes of +3.58% and +7.12%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% lower. Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Microsoft has a Forward P/E ratio of 25.69 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 26.3.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that MSFT has a PEG ratio of 2.38.

And, of course, they get their hands on extra talent that allows them to spur innovation and future growth.Several companies – Microsoft MSFT, Oracle ORCL, and Adobe Inc. ADBE – have all been on the offensive in 2022, unveiling acquisition news. Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each acquisition.Microsoft Acquires Activision BlizzardIn January 2022, Microsoft made a significant splash, shaking the gaming world to its core by acquiring Activision Blizzard ATVI for a whopping $68.7 billion. It was a massive deal that caught extensive attention, as it ranks as the largest acquisition in the video game industry’s history.Activision Blizzard is a leader in video game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher, most well-known for Call of Duty. MSFT already owns two massive video game titles, Halo – the company’s flagship video game, and Minecraft – the best-selling game of all time.Microsoft intends to publish all of ATVI’s hit video game titles onto its Xbox Game Pass; this unique gaming service allows gamers unlimited access to a library of games for a flat monthly rate.Microsoft shares currently trade at a 25.5X forward earnings multiple, off its 28.5X five-year median and above its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 22.3X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobe Acquires FigmaIn September 2022, Adobe went on the offensive, announcing its acquisition of Figma for roughly $20 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.A privately-held company, Figma is a web-first collaborative design platform structured to aid teams who build products together. The company has made the design process faster and more enjoyable, all while increasing efficiency.Story continuesThe combined company has a sizable, quickly-growing market opportunity projected to deliver substantial value for customers, shareholders, and the entire industry.Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe, said, “The combination of Adobe and Figma is transformational and will accelerate our vision for collaborative creativity.”On a relative basis, ADBE shares are cheap; the company’s 27.1X forward earnings multiple is a fraction of its 44.8X five-year median and well off 2021 highs of 65.5X.Still, the value undoubtedly remains on the higher end of the spectrum, typical of stocks with a high-growth nature.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOracle Acquires Adi InsightsIn May 2022, Oracle unveiled its announcement regarding its acquisition of Adi Insights, a top provider of workforce management solutions.Regarding the deal’s benefits, Adi Insights brings overtime management, time capture, demand forecasting, and shift scheduling to SuitePeople (NetSuite’s human resource program). It’s worth noting that Oracle leads NetSuite.Currently, ORCL shares trade at a 19.2X forward earnings multiple, above the 16.5X five-year median but below the Zacks sector average of 22.3X by a fair margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, for those who have an appetite for income, ORCL has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 1.6%, well above that of its Zacks sector average.Oracle has also been growing its dividend, upping its payout two times over the last five years, translating to an impressive 14.1% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineComing out of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic has indeed landed us in a unique economic environment in 2022, to say the least.A hawkish Federal Reserve, lingering COVID-19 uncertainties, and geopolitical issues have all been thorns in the side of the market.Still, amid all of the gloom and doom, there have been several notable acquisition announcements coming from sizable tech companies, including Microsoft MSFT, Oracle ORCL, and Adobe Inc.

The company struck an upbeat tone for the holidays on its earnings call, citing strength in website visits. Joining us now is Signet Jewelers CEO Gina Drosos. Gina, it's good to see you in our studio for a change.GINA DROSOS: I know.BRIAN SOZZI: Thanks for coming down. Appreciate it.GINA DROSOS: It's great to be here.BRIAN SOZZI: Let's start on those website visits because we are smack in the middle of the holiday shopping season. What are you seeing people browse for? And what does the demand environment feel like to you?GINA DROSOS: It's really interesting. One of our strategies has been to lead digital commerce in the jewelry category. It's a category that traditionally was very brick and mortar based. People only went into a store so they could be consulted or try on the product. Now we're actually selling a lot of jewelry online, but mostly browsing. 67% of our customers go online before they come into store.BRAD SMITH: That's interesting. And particularly for the environments that we had found being beneficial for Signet is the number of people that had to, unfortunately, put off some of the matrimonial celebrations or the weddings. We saw a great year, of course, here in 2022, but that's expected to tick down in 2023 as some of that demand starts to dissipate a little bit. What does that look like for your business?GINA DROSOS: You know, it's very interesting. Bridal is a great business to be in. I mean, every year, there are engagements, weddings, anniversaries. The first meaningful blip in decades happened because of COVID. So fewer people got engaged. Many fewer people got married during COVID because they wanted to be able to have a celebration with friends and family.Story continuesThis, 2022, is the year of the wedding, but we've seen engagements tick down a bit versus last year's peak, probably down a little bit next year, too. What we've done is pivot more to fashion jewelry. Romantic gifting has been very big coming out of COVID, people really wanting to celebrate those they love the most.JULIE HYMAN: And Gina, some of the other changes that you highlighted in the earnings and in the conference call has to do with the price points at which people are buying right now. And it sounds like the lower end is maybe waning a little bit, as we're seeing consumer trends change. Can you give us a little bit more detail on where on the spectrum we're seeing the buying?GINA DROSOS: Sure. Last year was a big year for lower priced jewelry. Stimulus was in the market. People really spending on themselves, which was great to see. Self purchase tends to be a lower priced purchase than bridal or romantic gifting. So we saw a big increase last year. That's been offset this year somewhat. We're still up on a stack basis. But we've seen lower income customers be more challenged. You know, discretionary price increases are impacting their discretionary spend more so than higher income customers.JULIE HYMAN: Are we seeing even engagement in the higher end jewelry, are we seeing buyers make different decisions at all? Are they bringing down what they're willing to spend at all?GINA DROSOS: No, we've seen a lot of strength at the higher end. Our average transaction value was up 8% in the quarter, up 27% versus three years ago. That is, in part, because of the pivot that we've made, recognizing that lower income customers would be more challenged. For that customer, we've added value engineered product really to give them a great value, financing alternatives. But we've also pivoted our marketing and our assortment to attract a higher end customer.BRIAN SOZZI: Within all the categories you sell at a Kay or a Jared, what is growing the fastest-- necklaces, rings, bracelets? What stands out to you?GINA DROSOS: You know, diamond tennis necklaces are really big this holiday season. Yellow gold continues to trend. Diamond set in yellow gold for bracelets and for rings have been great. But probably one of the most interesting trends is men's jewelry. Men's is really trending.

I see a guy with, I think, three necklaces on. I only have one. I only have one, Gina.GINA DROSOS: This is popular. So absolutely. Women have been layering necklaces for a couple of years now. But this year is the year that you're the--BRIAN SOZZI: So what you're saying is I'm off trend. I'm off trend.JULIE HYMAN: You can do whatever you want.BRIAN SOZZI: But I want to. I wouldn't mind helping the margins out at Signet if I look cool. It's all good.GINA DROSOS: Agree.JULIE HYMAN: I also want to ask you about Blue Nile and the integration there because I know analysts have a lot of questions about the profitability trajectory for Blue Nile. What can you tell us?GINA DROSOS: So Blue Nile is losing money at this point. It lost money in the third quarter. We anticipated that. And we more than offset that loss with an overperformance on our core business, which was nice to see. We anticipate it will lose money again in the third-- I mean in the fourth quarter. And we've said that it should be accretive to our business by the third quarter of next year.BRIAN SOZZI: I used to follow Blue Nile a lot. Why does it lose money? It doesn't carry inventory, right?GINA DROSOS: You know, what we're really looking at right now is the appropriate balance of their inventory and assortment so that we can really get the right margin structure, a good, better, best structure into Blue Nile and their marketing spend.BRIAN SOZZI: You still like--GINA DROSOS: There's a lot of efficiency in--BRIAN SOZZI: Are the stores still useful to have?GINA DROSOS: Blue Nile has about 23 showroom stores. So you don't really buy product in the stores. You go and a consultant helps you choose something that we then custom make for you and send it to you. Or you can pick it up in the store. It's very effective.BRAD SMITH: In the event of a mild recession, as we've heard from some bank CEOs, economists, what would that signal for the jewelry industry? What do you forecast or even model to some of your own business outlook as well?GINA DROSOS: You know, jewelry is not immune to macroeconomic pressure, but I would say it's very different from most of the rest of retail. Jewelry inherently holds its value, and customers know that. So they know that if they buy a nice piece of jewelry, it will be worth at least the same, if not have appreciated, a year later. So we see in tough times, even including recession, jewelry actually does much better than the rest of retail.BRAD SMITH: Signet Jewelers CEO Gina Drosos joining us here on set. Thanks so much for taking the time.GINA DROSOS: Thank you.]"

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.DecisionPoint Systems Inc. (DPSI) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 26.5%, the stock of this company is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. DPSI meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 82.7% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for DPSI is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.81. This indicates that the stock moves 81% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that DPSI has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped DPSI earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, DPSI is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. DPSI is currently trading at 0.73 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 73 cents for each dollar of sales.So, DPSI appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to DPSI, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Starbucks:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$4.4b ÷ (US$28b - US$9.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Therefore, Starbucks has an ROCE of 24%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Starbucks roceIn the above chart we have measured Starbucks' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Starbucks here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of Starbucks' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 38% where it was five years ago. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Our Take On Starbucks' ROCEIn summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Starbucks is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 90% to shareholders over the last five years. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.Story continuesIf you want to know some of the risks facing Starbucks we've found 4 warning signs (2 are a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Starbucks is not the only stock earning high returns.

Sixty-five percent of millennials ages 25-39 reported the same. Now, this data doesn't take into account who buys their coffee and who makes it at home, but it can be assumed a good number of young people are shelling out for barista-made lattes.Even if you do buy coffee daily, this habit doesn't have to financially stress you.""We all get to spend our money how we want to,"" said Jay Zigmont, Ph.D., CFP® and founder of Childfree Wealth. ""The way I look at it is that [nobody else] gets a vote on how I spend my money, and I don't get a vote on theirs.""Even so, there are ways to make your coffee purchases less burdensome on your bank account.

""⁣Yes, we've all seen it. 'If you gave up your $5 coffee every day for the rest of your life THEN you'd be a millionaire!!!' One of the biggest things that's actually stopping you from becoming a millionaire ⁣is restriction.""Elise said that instead of restricting your spending on the things you enjoy, you should set realistic goals that serve you and your bank account.These goals can include moving your savings to a high-yield account (which could subsidize your coffee fund); committing to returning clothes or other items you don't like; taking advantage of your employer-offered 401(k); or any number of things that pave your path to financial success -- all while enjoying that steaming cup of coffee.Story continuesTake Our Poll: Do You Think Student Loan Debt Should Be Forgiven?Shutterstock.comExamine What a 'Waste of Money' Is to YouWhile some may consider daily coffee a waste of money, if it's something you enjoy then you shouldn't be pressured to stop buying it. However, if you're feeling financially squeezed because of your coffee habit, you may want to reevaluate your other budget items.""There is no one right approach to handle your funds, especially because everyone's financial situation and aspirations are unique. [One way to manage your money is by] cutting out costs you don't use and redirecting that money into activities you genuinely like,"" said Victoria Culbertson, CEO of NYC House Cleaners.""In other words, it's acceptable to spend money on simple pleasures like your favorite iced coffee, as long as you remember to cancel that gym membership you never use or any other items that no longer offer you joy.""As Culbertson said, you should identify the purchases you make that you actually consider a waste of money and cut them out.

In essence, say you've just spent $6.75 on a coffee. The app will 'round up' the fee to $7, sending the $6.75 to the vendor and putting aside the 25 cents in a separate pot,"" he explained.If your bank doesn't offer a round-up feature, some popular apps that do include Acorns, which invests your extra cents, and Chime, an online bank that transfers the round-up money directly to your savings account.

While it's not a cheaper cup of coffee, it can pay dividends down the road!""If you go into an office every day, consider inviting a co-worker out to coffee one day -- preferably one you're not already friends with.

You can skip our detailed analysis on dividend investment and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Low-Risk Dividend Stocks to Invest In. The stock market has been rocky throughout this year, making investors anxious about the outlook of the financial situation. The S&amp;P 500 is down 17.83% year-to-date through December 7, and analysts are predicting more volatility in the upcoming months, possibly leading to a recession. In these times, investors tend to minimize risks of potential losses by prioritizing low-risk investments.Dividend investment is considered a safe option in the current economic landscape as these securities have historically outperformed the broader market with less volatility. According to a report by Fidelity, high-dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during the last two bear markets. The report also mentioned that dividends have accounted for nearly half of the total returns of the S&amp;P 500 over the past 30 years.This year’s returns have also exhibited the strong performance of dividend stocks over other asset classes. The Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index is down by just 0.95% year-to-date, which is very mild considering the broader market’s returns. Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, spoke to Barron’s in December about the overall performance of dividend stocks. He said that during periods of slow economic growth, investors load up on dividend stocks because of their defensive qualities. He further mentioned that dividend strategies are expected to outperform in 2023 as well, with high dividend growth companies stealing the limelight. Senyek named the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index one of his favorite plays, as the companies in the index are mainly known for their consistent dividend growth.Some dividend stocks that are popular amongst investors this year include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). Further in this article, we will discuss some of the best low-risk dividend stocks to invest in.Story continuesPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:We analyzed the following low-risk stocks through their business fundamentals, dividend policies, and overall financial health.

(NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of December 7: 1.49% Beta Value: 0.53Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail company that operates a chain of hypermarkets and department stores. Following the company's solid quarterly earnings, Atlantic Equities raised its price target on the stock to $165 with an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm also appreciated the company's long-term fundamentals.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.49%. The company is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it has raised its payouts for 49 years consecutively. It can be added to dividend portfolios alongside McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).In the first nine months of the year, Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January.

It’s Worth Checking Your Spare ChangeHoliday Spending: Get Top Holiday Shopping and Savings Tips“It’s awkward and you have little time to think, [so] you check the 20% option because it’s expeditious,” Julie Paulson, a long-term-care volunteer in San Antonio, Texas, previously told GOBankingRates.Starbucks is one of the most recent companies to implement “suggested tips” at the point of sale. And, based on the response on social media, it seems some baristas and customers alike are unhappy about it.Customers took to Twitter to complain, with the bulk of reactions ranging from anger to anxiety. User @_treagan tweeted bluntly: “Why tf Starbucks just ask for a tip on the pin pad????” while user @toxicjajin confessed that, “Starbucks stresses me out every time they ask me to tip.”Others pointed out that the coffee chain should increase wages rather than passing costs to customers.Tips to Avoid TippingOf course, you can simply hit “0” at the prompt and go about your day without tipping your barista — and according to some reports, there could be some anxiety on the barista’s side of the transaction, too.“Some people feel incredibly awkward about asking for tips and having to adjust to a new system,” wrote redditor MassRevo in a now-deleted thread.Of course, there’s no need to announce you aren’t tipping, just click the “no tip” option on the screen.If you’d like to avoid the awkward exchange on both sides, you can simply pay cash instead, or order through the Starbucks app.Accepting Tip Culture With GraceTip culture has become a part of society. While many baristas dislike the new system, others are welcoming the increased income they’re receiving as a result.Story continuesRedditor Cats_with_tentacles wrote: “We normally get around $500 in tips each week in cash. Our first week with cc tips… that number went up to $2,500.”Whichever side of the register you’re on, the best way to handle this new tipping culture is to take it in stride. As Redditor Sugarhicccup, purportedly a Starbucks barista, wrote: “Please stop complaining about getting money we deserve.”Other baristas on Reddit agreed, with many offering advice on how to make the exchange less awkward by simply telling customers they will need to “answer a question on the screen before they can pay.”Take Our Poll: How Has Inflation Impacted Your Holiday Shopping Plans?More: 4 Ways To Save at Starbucks in December, Including Possible Starbucks for Life PrizeSugarhicccup took a practical, straightforward stance: “Hand them the credit card machine.

Of course, your caffeine intake is not the only thing going up from there. You see, Starbucks has rolled out a new tipping feature, and for those who pay only with credit cards. And baristas are well steamed, if you will.And customers are angry, venti, venting frustration on TikTok are these baristas with the new hashtag, #baristaproblems. You see, videos are racking up millions of views and employees even hiding from their customers when this awkward transaction ensues. They hold out the credit machine. Option one, $1 tip. Option two, $2 tip. Or there's the option to do none, or other. Here in New York, your average Starbucks barista makes 16.75 an hour-- not bad.Here's a tip, then, for Howard Schultz. Make those options a quarter, $0.50. And call me a cheapskate, 0 should be on the main screen for pouring my cold brew in a cup. And Seana, my tipping point came last night, Madison Square Garden. Paid-- this guy here paid 17.24 for a hard iced tea, 17.24, and then came the option for the tips-- $1, $2 $3. You know I chose other and opted for a quarter. Am I a cheapskate? Or have we all just reached our collective tipping point? It is absurd.SEANA SMITH: It is a little absurd. I also like that your choice was Twisted Tea out of everything that was available at MSG.DAVE BRIGGS: I knew you would point that out, Budlight with lemon girl.SEANA SMITH: We'll talk about that another time, but no, a quarter, I do agree with that because I think a lot of people are a little bit overwhelmed. And I think people feel bad about if they don't tip, and they want to give something, but they don't necessarily want to give $1, $2, especially in this current economic environment, when people are paying more and more for almost every single product in their life. So I think this-- it was interesting what you said about the baristas, some of them hiding and it being uncomfortable for them.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: They're embarrassed by this policy.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, so I wouldn't be, then, surprised if maybe Starbucks shifts its whole view on this maybe, and maybe does-- maybe they should take your advice-- offer a quarter or $0.50. But more broadly speaking, tipping this holiday season, the trends that we are seeing, more people are tipping. But to your point, they're tipping less. So if you are maybe giving more of an option, the quarter or $0.50, something that doesn't jump out so much to the people that are buying these products on the screen, will make everyone feel a little bit better. And people will take home more at the end of the day, hopefully.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, look, and I think you're actually hurting these baristas with this policy. Not just the embarrassment factor, but the fact that I'm staring at a $1 option after a $7 cup of coffee means I'm ultimately more likely to push 0 because there ain't no way we can afford an $8 cup of coffee. So I think the smart policy would be to bring it-- when we used to have some change in our pocket, that's what we'd put in the tip jar. Do you or do you not? I admit-- sorry, baristas-- I do not tip at Starbucks.SEANA SMITH: But you tipped--DAVE BRIGGS: Do you?SEANA SMITH: I've seen you tip. You've tipped our barista here.DAVE BRIGGS: Our guy, yes. I do tip our guy at the coffee bar.SEANA SMITH: So you do. You don't have the [INAUDIBLE]. I don't always tip. Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't. It really depends on the mood. But I would tip a lot more if there was a quarter or $0.50 option. I do agree with you.]"

My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $426.11, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low.

He further mentioned that dividend strategies are expected to outperform in 2023 as well, with high dividend growth companies stealing the limelight. Senyek named the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index one of his favorite plays, as the companies in the index are mainly known for their consistent dividend growth.Some dividend stocks that are popular amongst investors this year include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).

88,4df01dd5-0e9a-341e-be7f-97216cb00445,ADM,2022-12-08,5 Stocks Your Portfolio Must Have Amid Persisting Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-portfolio-must-amid-125712913.html,1670417832,STORY,['ADM'],"[U.S. stock markets are in the grip of volatility once again. Wall Street has suffered a bloody blow this year. However, markets witnessed a bear market relief rally from mid-June to mid-August, which eventually evaporated owing to a record-high inflation rate and an extremely high interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Wall Street has again seen an impressive rally since mid-October. A less-than-expected inflation rate in October with respect to several measures along with a dovish comment from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in November boosted investors’ confidence in risky assets like equities.However, hotter-than-expected job additions and a higher wage rate in November once again dampened the mood on Wall Street. Market participants are now unsure whether the Fed will reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike in the December FOMC meeting, as indicated by Powell, or will hike the rate by 75 basis points for the fifth time in a row.A tight labor market is being perceived as a pushback from the Fed’s recent stance of trying to reassure the markets that it would slacken its stringent policy measures to avoid a hard-landing of the economy.Market participants are not sure whether the terminal interest for this round of monetary tightening will stay within the 5% threshold or go beyond that. A section of economists and financial experts are concerned that a higher interest rate will lead to a recession in 2023.Stock Selection ProcessWall Street is likely to remain volatile in the near future as market participants are waiting for highly important consumer price index data for November and the Fed’s December FOMC policy decisions. Retail sales and industrial production data for November are also slated to be released next week.At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option. If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payment will act as a regular income stream.Story continuesWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks that have popped over 25% year to date with more upside left.

90,293dbf15-7ee7-3887-82ed-81a2b3f409b3,SNPS,2022-12-08,15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-nanotechnology-companies-world-194851468.html,1670442531,STORY,"['GE', 'VECO', 'PPG', 'ADI', 'SNPS', 'CDNS', 'AMAT', 'MMM', 'COHR', 'DD', 'IBM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest nanotechnology companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World. If there is one industry that often sounds as if it is in the realm of science fiction, it is nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the use of materials science industrially involving matter whose dimensions range between one nanometer to 100 nanometers. For reference, a single strand of a human hair ranges anywhere between 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers, so nanotechnology, by definition, involves manipulating matter to sizes that are up to 100,000 times smaller than a hair on your head.Owing to the advantages offered by this unique manipulation, nanotechnology is adopted in a variety of different industries. These include construction, healthcare, and energy. In the construction industry, these technologies are used to create new materials that are durable and provide lucrative benefits such as water resistance, corrosion protection, and even self cleaning. Another widely popular application is the semiconductor industry, which has successfully created transistors that are now as small as 3 nanometers. Healthcare is another segment that benefits from nanotechnology, as nanotubes, owing to their small size, are effective fighters against cancer cells. These treatments involve injecting the nanotubes in the vicinity of cancer cells, and once they are bombarded with lasers, they generate heat that ends up killing the cancer cells. Nanoparticles are also used to bypass the blood-brain barrier due to their small size.Moving towards the industry itself, and growth estimates, the nanotechnology sector is projected to strongly grow due to its novelty and relatively nascent nature. For instance, a research report from Valuates Reports believes that the nanotechnology market was worth $1.76 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.4% between then and 2030 to be worth $33.63 billion by the end of the forecast period. The firm also believes that healthcare will be the largest segment, and nanodevices will be the most lucrative product category. Furthermore, it also outlines that Asia Pacific industry segment will grow at 40%, to outpace the overall industry trend, and the aerospace and defense sector will be the fastest growing user with a whopping 43.4% CAGR.Story continuesAnother report, this time from Atlantic Market Research, estimates a 13.6% CAGR for the nanotechnology market. According to the research firm, the industry will be worth $11.7 billion in 2023. Atlantic Market Research also outlines that electronic applications will hold a 27% market share of the nanotechnology market from 2021 to 2030. It adds that North America held a 21% market share of the nanomaterials market in 2020, and a 38% share of the broader nanotechnology market during the same year.Finally, Precedence Research has the largest estimate for the future value of the nanotechnology market. This research firm believes that the industry was worth $85 billion in 2021, and it will grow to a stunning $288 billion by 2030 through a 14.5% CAGR. Precedence Research also believes that as of May 2022, 20,000 nanotechnology researchers were working in the United States, and despite this, China will be the largest player in the future as well in addition to holding a 35% market share in 2021. Some key trends for the sector include semiconductors and electronics, while hurdles include the difficulties of scaling up the production of the products. These include the recent chip shortages that have created difficulties for both personal computing and automotive markets recently.Today's piece will focus on companies that work in the nanotechnology industry, and it ranges from those that provide the products and services to those that provide backend support. Top players include International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the Worldscience photo/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We took a look at several industries such as chip fabrication, healthcare, and industrials to determine which companies use nanotechnology.

91,a54dcb27-3451-3fa5-be35-e17e62287f41,SNPS,2022-12-08,Looking for a Growth Stock? 3 Reasons Why Synopsys (SNPS) is a Solid Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-growth-stock-3-reasons-174505494.html,1670435105,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Synopsys (SNPS) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software used to test and develop chips is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Synopsys is 32.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 13.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 2.6%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Synopsys is 25.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 16%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 31.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 13.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Synopsys have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.5% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Synopsys a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Synopsys well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We have Southwest, GM, and Apple. Pras Subramanian is also here with us to break down some of these biggest movers. Let's kick it off with my pick, and that is Southwest. The stock moving to the downside today, off nearly 5%. Citi warning of higher CapEx in the fourth quarter, noting the potential issue of pilot pay. That could be an issue here coming forward for these airlines.This update from Citi coming as Southwest holds its investor day, where it kept its 2023 and fourth quarter outlook largely unchanged. It did reinstate its dividend at $0.18 a share. That dividend had been suspended during the pandemic. Pras, lots of uncertainty around these airlines, what exactly demand is going to look like going forward after we get past this kind of pent-up COVID demand. People will pay anything to travel right now. Prices are still very, very high. Questions about whether or not people are going to still be willing to pay those prices in a couple of months from now.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, I saw that pre-pan-- or Thanksgiving air travel returned to pre-pandemic levels. Lots of people traveling. That leisure travel is back. Business travel coming on soon. It's funny you mention that they're reinstating that dividend. They have that while the pilots are picketing over new higher wages. So you have that kind of dichotomy of companies saying, hey, we want to reinstate the dividend, but they ordered a bunch of new Boeing planes that are going to actually eat into cost, too. So that's another thing to watch there for Southwest.]"

If you want to read about some more commodity stocks to buy on the dip, go directly to 5 Best Commodity Stocks To Buy on the Dip.Over the past year, commodities stocks were trading at record highs due to a macro environment characterized by soaring inflation and rising interest rates. This boom had come after years of stalled prices in the sector that had led economic experts, like Jim Cramer of Mad Money on CNBC, to advise investors at the time to buy the dip in the commodities sector, before a spike in the prices of prominent stocks like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM). As new economic data shows that the US is on a path to recovery after two consecutive quarters of stalled growth, and as supply chains improve, resulting in lower-than-expected inflation readings, commodity stocks are witnessing a dip in their share prices once again. However, the market is expected to continue to be volatile due to the Russian war in Ukraine and the uncertain virus situation in China, meaning that any dip is likely to be short-lived and provides a buying opportunity for shrewd investors. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the commodities sector were selected for the list. Only firms that have seen their share price decline by more than 10% in the past six months were selected. These stocks are popular among the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and also have long-term growth prospects, as discussed in the article below. 11 Best Commodity Stocks To Buy on the DipPhoto by Francisco Fernandes on UnsplashBest Commodity Stocks To Buy on the Dip11.

102,5a9db2ce-365d-3b6e-92c9-550412b9f122,WU,2022-12-08,The Western Union Company's (NYSE:WU) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 96% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-union-companys-nyse-wu-104735230.html,1670410055,STORY,['WU'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Western Union Is Western Union Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$702.8mUS$744.0mUS$760.5mUS$776.8mUS$793.1mUS$809.4mUS$825.9mUS$842.6mUS$859.5mUS$876.7mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 2.22%Est @ 2.14%Est @ 2.1%Est @ 2.06%Est @ 2.04%Est @ 2.02%Est @ 2.01%Est @ 2% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.0% US$645US$627US$588US$551US$516US$484US$453US$424US$397US$371(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.1bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$877m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.0%– 2.0%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 9.0%)10= US$5.4bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$10b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$13.8, the company appears quite undervalued at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Western Union as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.254. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Western Union, there are three additional items you should further examine:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Western Union   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for WU's future outlook?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the mall industry in the US and go directly to 5 Largest Shopping Malls in the United States.The State of the Mall IndustryThe shopping-mall industry in the US grew exponentially from the 50s as suburban life took hold of the country, raising the demand for local shopping centers. Fast-forward to the 21st century, the Internet ushered the US into the age of online shopping, where you can find and buy pretty much whatever you want from the comfort of your couch. This has led to a decline in the shopping-mall appeal. The decline was accelerated during the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 when online shopping grew by 43% according to the US Census Bureau. While shopping malls are still one of the major players in the US retail market, online shopping is projected to account for a third of all retail shopping by 2030, per Kearney, a global management consulting firm. On the other hand, The mall vacancy rate has risen to 8.3% as of Q4 2021, according to data from Statista. This has left the mall REITs with the choice to either evolve or die out. Rate-Hike OnslaughtTo make matters worse, rising interest rates in the US to counter inflation are expected to drive many retailers out of business. Rate hikes are making it harder for consumers to spend money, which is driving the demand for retail goods down. In addition, many retailers had tapped into revolving credit facilities in 2020 to stay in business during lockdowns. The amount these companies borrowed accounted for $145 billion of the $252 billion of total credit, and a significant portion of this amount was variable-rate debt, which is expected to be paid back in the next five years. This means that many retailers would be paying their debt with rising interest rates, at a time when consumers are shopping less. It represents a real risk of driving many retailers out of business, which is further expected to increase the mall vacancy rate through the next five years. Additionally, it’ll make it harder for the survivors to expand their presence in shopping malls. Story continuesFuture of Shopping MallsThe situation on the ground doesn’t look good for shopping mall REITs, but there are ways around irrelevance in the long-term future. According to a Reuters report, Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), the biggest mall-owning REIT in the US, is in talks with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to turn its vacant Sears and J.C. Penney stores into fulfillment centers. Many other shopping malls in North America and Europe are turning towards logistics as the answer to their decreasing revenue in retail. Apart from rising demand for warehouses, logistics also carries financial benefits. The space for retail costs on average $20 per square foot, while the same for warehouse space is only $6.5.Another way the shopping-malls are adapting is by moving more and more towards facilities that are experience-oriented, like event organization, art galleries, cinemas and museums.Now that we know the state of the mall industry, let’s head towards the list of 25 largest shopping malls in the United States.25 Largest Shopping Malls in the United StatesOur MethodologyFor our list of the 25 largest shopping malls in the United States, we’ve ranked them based on their total retail space in square feet.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World. If there is one industry that often sounds as if it is in the realm of science fiction, it is nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the use of materials science industrially involving matter whose dimensions range between one nanometer to 100 nanometers. For reference, a single strand of a human hair ranges anywhere between 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers, so nanotechnology, by definition, involves manipulating matter to sizes that are up to 100,000 times smaller than a hair on your head.Owing to the advantages offered by this unique manipulation, nanotechnology is adopted in a variety of different industries. These include construction, healthcare, and energy. In the construction industry, these technologies are used to create new materials that are durable and provide lucrative benefits such as water resistance, corrosion protection, and even self cleaning. Another widely popular application is the semiconductor industry, which has successfully created transistors that are now as small as 3 nanometers. Healthcare is another segment that benefits from nanotechnology, as nanotubes, owing to their small size, are effective fighters against cancer cells. These treatments involve injecting the nanotubes in the vicinity of cancer cells, and once they are bombarded with lasers, they generate heat that ends up killing the cancer cells. Nanoparticles are also used to bypass the blood-brain barrier due to their small size.Moving towards the industry itself, and growth estimates, the nanotechnology sector is projected to strongly grow due to its novelty and relatively nascent nature. For instance, a research report from Valuates Reports believes that the nanotechnology market was worth $1.76 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.4% between then and 2030 to be worth $33.63 billion by the end of the forecast period. The firm also believes that healthcare will be the largest segment, and nanodevices will be the most lucrative product category. Furthermore, it also outlines that Asia Pacific industry segment will grow at 40%, to outpace the overall industry trend, and the aerospace and defense sector will be the fastest growing user with a whopping 43.4% CAGR.Story continuesAnother report, this time from Atlantic Market Research, estimates a 13.6% CAGR for the nanotechnology market. According to the research firm, the industry will be worth $11.7 billion in 2023. Atlantic Market Research also outlines that electronic applications will hold a 27% market share of the nanotechnology market from 2021 to 2030. It adds that North America held a 21% market share of the nanomaterials market in 2020, and a 38% share of the broader nanotechnology market during the same year.Finally, Precedence Research has the largest estimate for the future value of the nanotechnology market. This research firm believes that the industry was worth $85 billion in 2021, and it will grow to a stunning $288 billion by 2030 through a 14.5% CAGR. Precedence Research also believes that as of May 2022, 20,000 nanotechnology researchers were working in the United States, and despite this, China will be the largest player in the future as well in addition to holding a 35% market share in 2021. Some key trends for the sector include semiconductors and electronics, while hurdles include the difficulties of scaling up the production of the products.

Solomon said on Tuesday, the first day of the firm’s U.S. Financial Services Conference. “Our economists expect the global economy to grow by 1.9% in 2023,” Solomon said. “They believe Europe is already in the midst of a mild recession.” And Goldman economists predict the U.S. will narrowly avert a recession, he said.“I'm actually slightly more cautious when I talk to clients,” Solomon said. “They sound extremely cautious. Many CEOs are watching the data, waiting to see what happens…But I'm not hearing panic.”But Solomon did indicate a change. “We're seeing clients shift attention away from supply chain resiliency and toward keeping headcount down.” That’s evident in what seems like almost daily announcements of hiring freezes or layoffs by companies across industries.The largest cost for Goldman Sachs is “our people,” Solomon said. “The job market remains surprisingly tight and the competition for our talent, particularly top talent, is as strong as ever.” The firm will continue to seek to balance, and “appropriate pay for performance mindset with a focus on talent retention at this time,” he said.Pay for performance usually includes bonuses, which will shrink for Wall Street bankers, according to a recent report by Johnson Associates. The compensation management consulting firm projects that for investment bankers, incentive pay may drop by as much as 45% compared to last year.Goldman's latest restructuring included combining the bank’s wealth management and asset divisions into a single unit, and merging its investment banking and trading businesses into another.“The labor market is still super tight, no matter how you measure it, obviously,” Marianne Lake, co-CEO of consumer and community banking at [hotlink]JPMorgan Chase[/hotlink], said during the conference. “But it does feel like we're past the peak of wage inflation,” said Lake, who is a former CFO at JPMorgan. “It feels like the sort of frenzy on hiring and the super elevated attrition rates, for us, and generally, have abated a bit. So we look for that to soften into 2023.” The outlook on unemployment is that it will move higher in 2023 peaking in 2024, slightly about 5%, Lake said.Story continuesThe U.S. economy is still strong, she said. But the outlook is for a “shallow and short-lived"" recession at the end of next year, Lake said. For JPMorgan, ""I think the performance of markets so far this quarter is good, specifically in fixed income,"" she said.The glass is half full or half emptyIn November, consumer spending was up 5%, Brian Moynihan, chairman and CEO at [hotlink]Bank of America[/hotlink], said during the conference. Compared to previous periods, “The rate of growth and spending is starting to slow,” Moynihan said. That’s the impact of the Fed raising interest rates to get inflation under control, he said.You can look at it as the glass is half full or half empty metaphor, he said. “Half full is—consumers are still in the game, and half empty is—they're starting to slow down,” he explained. The question then becomes, how soon will the Fed stabilize the economy in order to “avoid more damage?"" BofA researchers predict ""negative growth"" in the first part of next year, but a recession would be ""mild,” he said.In Q3, big U.S. banks, including Goldman, JPMorgan and BofA, reported weaker profits as the economy slowed and dealmaking was halted by volatile markets.Key partnerships Amid predictions about the future of the economy at the conference, a CEO took the time to publicly thank his CFO for his service. [hotlink]KeyCorp[/hotlink] recently announced Donald R. Kimble, longtime CFO and chief administrative officer, will retire on May 1.“I just want to take a moment and acknowledge Don Kimble,” KeyCorp CEO Christopher Gorman said during the company’s panel session. “Don, thank you for your steadfast leadership,” he said to Kimble. “Thank you for all you've done for Key over the last decade.” Gorman then welcomed the next CFO, Clark H.I. Khayat, currently chief strategy officer, who was also in attendance.So, while financial services execs continue to navigate the uncertain economy going into next year, CEO and CFO partnership is still key.See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comSign up here to receive CFO Daily weekday mornings in your inbox.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

HBI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Universal Logistics ULH, GasLog Partners GLOP and Dorian LPG LPG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Schlumberger is quietly growing its earnings as energy moves into a multiyear bull cycle. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see double digit earnings growth this year and in 2023.Schlumberger describes itself as a technology company that partners with customers to access energy. It deploys digital solutions and innovative technologies in the energy industry, including oil and natural gas.It has expertise in 120 countries.A Perfect Earnings Surprise RecordOn Oct 21, 2022, Schlumberger reported its third quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus by $0.08. Earnings were $0.63 compared to the Zacks Consensus of just $0.55.It was another beat in a 5-year perfect earnings track record. That's impressive as it includes the pandemic and the collapse of the crude market in 2020.Revenue rose 28% year-over-year and 10% from the second quarter to $7.5 billion. International revenue drove the quarter as it was up 13% sequentially to $5.9 billion while North America was flat sequentially at $1.5 billion.Revenue growth was propelled by Well Construction and Production Systems as global activity strengthened, particularly in the offshore and international markets.Well Construction revenue was up 15% sequentially, outperforming global rig count growth due to strong activity and pricing improvements in Europe/CIA/Africa and Latin America.Production Systems revenue rose 14% sequentially on higher product deliveries and backlog conversion, mostly in international offshore basins.Analysts Raise Earnings EstimatesSchlumberger was bullish about the fourth quarter, saying it expected to deliver further sequential revenue growth and margin expansion.Story continues9 estimates are higher for 2022 in the last 2 months, including one in just the last week, pushing up the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $2.15 from $2.02 during that time.That is earnings growth of 68% as Schlumberger made just $1.28 last year.9 estimates have also been revised for 2023 in the last 60 days as well. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $3.03 from $2.76 in that time.That's another earnings growth of 40.6%.Shares Up Big in 2022Shares of Schlumberger have been on a volatile ride in 2022 but are now up 60.4% on the year. That is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) which is down 17.6% during that time.Shares are not cheap, even with the earnings on the rise. It trades with a forward P/E of 23.9 but has a PEG ratio of just 0.6. A PEG under 1.0 usually indicates a company has both growth and value. That's a powerful combination.Schlumberger is shareholder friendly. It saw free cash flow of $1.1 billion in the third quarter and pays a dividend currently yielding 1.4%.For investors looking for a growth and value energy stock, Schlumberger is one to add to the short list.Bear of the Day:HanesBrands Inc. is facing an uncertain retail environment. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see earnings decline by the double digits this year.HanesBrands is an apparel company with well known brands such as Hanes, Champion and Bonds. It employs 59,000 associates in 33 countries.Met the Estimate in the Third QuarterOn Nov 9, 2022, HanesBrands reported third quarter earnings and met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.29.Net sales fell 7% to $1.67 billion, but in constant currency it fell 3%. The constant currency decline was due to the macro-driven slowdown in consumer spending in the U.S. and certain Asian markets, coupled with the impact to orders as U.S. retailers were tightly managing their own inventory levels, which have spiked.Those headwinds more than offset growth in innerwear in Australia and the Other Americas as well as Champion growth in Europe.HanesBrands was also committed to reducing its own inventory situation. On a unit basis, inventory rose 16% year-over-year but decreased 6% as compared to the second quarter 2022.

However, with the easing of the COVID-induced restrictions, economic activities have gained pace this year.This improved scenario has been a boon for transportation companies that have bounced back this year after being laid low over the past few years. The favorable scenario surrounding the sector implies that investing in transportation stocks is a prudent move. We believe that stocks like Universal Logistics, GasLog Partners and Dorian LPG offer compelling investment opportunities.Tailwinds Surrounding the SectorThe corner of the sector that houses airline stocks has been well-served by the stronger-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand as people are again booking flights, thereby boosting passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines’ top lines.Moreover, owing to the uptick in economic activities, freight demand continues to be strong despite minor hiccups. This is supporting growth for railroad operators and transportation service providers. The Cass Freight shipments Index improved 2.9% year over year in October. The overall improving trend is evident from the fact that the measure has improved year over year in six (February, March, July, August, September and October) of the 10 months reported so far this year.Even though economies are reopening, consumers’ urge for online shopping refuses to relent. This continued strength in e-commerce demand bodes well for packaging companies in the sector.Moreover, owing to increased demand, the financial health of transportation companies has improved this year. As a result, we have seen many companies in the space hiking dividends. Investors are always on the lookout for dividend stocks as these provide a steady source of income and a cushion against market uncertainty, as is the current scenario. Dividend stocks are safe bets for creating wealth, as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty.Owing to the abovementioned tailwinds surrounding the sector, we believe that adding transportation stocks to one’s portfolio for generating handsome returns is a prudent move. We have zeroed in on three transportation stocks by running the Zacks Stocks Screener. Our choices have had a stellar run on the bourse this year, each gaining in excess of 50% year to date.Also, the selected stocks currently carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company offers services across its entire supply chain, including truckload, brokerage, intermodal, dedicated and value-added services.Owing to the uptick in economic activities, the contract logistics and intermodal segments of ULH are performing well, in turn boosting top-line growth. Driven by the positives, shares of ULH have surged 97.7% so far this year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 10.3% upward over the past 60 days. For 2023, the consensus mark for earnings has moved 5.8% north in the same time frame. The favorable estimate revisions reflect the confidence of brokers in the stock. ULH currently has a Growth Score of A.GasLog owns, operates and acquires LNG carriers with multi-year charters.

""It's absolutely very, very critical, and they've done it at the right time.""According to a new study by Kantar Research, about 1 in 4 current Disney+ subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version — translating to roughly 46 million of the streamer's total 164 million user base.Industry experts argue offering lower-cost, ad-supported options are still an important hedge against churn — something all streamers want to avoid amid increased competition.On Tuesday, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos teased there could be more ad-supported offerings for the leading streaming service, telling investors at a UBS conference: ""We have multiple tiers today. So it's likely there will be multiple ad tiers over time, but nothing to talk about yet.""The executive added Netflix's ad tier is likely to change and develop over time, explaining: ""The product itself will evolve. I suspect pretty dramatically, but slowly and gradually.""Netflix's ad tier, competitively priced at $6.99 a month, comes with a few downsides like the inability to download movies and TV shows. Additionally, due to various licensing restrictions across countries, about 10% of overall content is not available for users in the ad tier.Story continues""Nearly about 90% of watching is covered in the ad tier today,"" Sarandos revealed during Tuesday's conference, explaining that number should slowly tick higher. ""You should expect — [not] complete parity, but near parity over time.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Iger's shift toward profitabilityAs Disney looks to leverage its ad tier, recently returned CEO Bob Iger hopes the debut can help soften unfavorable investor sentiment, as Disney shares are off more than 40% since the start of the year.In its most recent fiscal year, losses for Disney's direct-to-consumer unit, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, totaled $4 billion for the year.The streaming division lost a combined $1.5 billion in the company's latest quarter, missing expectations and sending shares down more than 10% following the results.Iger, who spoke to employees at a company-wide town hall last week, noted a strategic shift towards profits is currently underway, revealing there are currently no plans to reverse the hiring freeze implemented by Bob Chapek earlier this month as he continues to evaluate Disney's current cost structure.Executive Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger arrives at the world premiere for the film 'The King's Man' at Leicester Square in London, Britain December 6, 2021.

This has outpaced the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 6.82% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.7% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Netflix as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.49, down 63.16% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $7.85 billion, up 1.83% from the year-ago period.NFLX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $10.27 per share and revenue of $31.58 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -8.63% and +6.34%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends.

Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 7.18, so we one might conclude that Netflix is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.49.

Disney’s direct-to-consumer division suffered in particular, posting a $1.5 billion loss even as subscription numbers increased. Iger has made increasing profit margins for Disney+ a priority, arguing that the company should cut its production cost.The cost of Disney+’s ad-supported tier subscription is in line with most other streaming services, such as HBOMax, Peacock, and Netflix, which all offer streaming plans with ads for under $10 a month.

According to CEO Ted Sarandos, multiple new payment tiers are in development, as the company aims to boost revenue amid increased competition. Currently, Netflix charges $6.99 for a basic plan with ads and $9.99 for an ad-free plan. There are also more expensive plans with an option for simultaneous streaming on multiple devices.As monthly fees fluctuate, Netflix is hoping its continued investment in premium content will keep its subscriber base stable, as well as spur new subscribers in developing markets globally. Season four of the 80s-themed Stranger Things became the second Netflix show to pass one billion hours streamed, and the platform has also found recent success with surprise-hit Wednesday, a spin-off of the Addams Family, which is on track to become the third-most streamed series in Netflix history. Additionally, the company hopes to build on the buzz with the much-anticipated Harry &amp; Meghan, a 6-part docu-series about the couple produced by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex themselves that premieres on Thursday (Dec. 8).Despite a recent stumble in earnings, Netflix has consistently been the most profitable streaming service. After posting subscriber losses in the first half of 2022, the company was still able to beat revenue expectations.Now that streaming services have become a permanent fixture in the homes of millions of Americans, the question of profitability will take center stage. This likely means price hikes across the industry, more ads, less money spent on original programming, and, for its competitors, trying to catch up to Netflix.

The toppling of ad revenues could be attributed to the economic downturn, which started with the coronavirus pandemic and was further led by the Russia-Ukraine War. These have resulted in high inflation, rising interest rates, high capital costs, a soaring US dollar and an anticipated recession in the coming year.In such turbulent and uncertain markets, companies are trying to decrease their costs and the first step to take on the heels of it is to compromise on advertising expenses. Per Duke Today, 42% of the companies are set to cut marketing budgets in the coming months.This trend is likely to prevail in the coming quarters as ad-spending is not expected to grow robustly, which suggests that Paramount could face difficulties in boosting its top-line unless the economy revives.Insider Intelligence has slashed global 2022 ad-spending forecast by nearly 6% and predicts it to reach only $695.96 billion by 2024, from the prior guidance of $756.47 billion.However, on the brighter side, though advertising is seen taking a dip, what offsets it is the company’s subscription revenues.Paramount added 4.6 million subscribers to its Paramount Plus streaming service and Pluto TV added 2.4 million monthly active users globally in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. This has bolstered affiliate and subscription revenues by 8% in the discussed quarter.The company now expects to exceed its full year global direct to consumer subscriber growth expectation of 75 million global subscribers.Story continuesParamount Global Price and Consensus Paramount Global Price and ConsensusParamount Global price-consensus-chart | Paramount Global Quote Streaming services in particular are gaining huge traction from viewers these days due to the ongoing cord-cutting. Per Future Market Insights, the video streaming market size is expected to grow from $73 billion in 2021 to $750 billion by 2031. This serves as an opportunity for Paramount to aid its top line by providing indulging content to its audience.However, given the wide opportunity in this segment, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company is bound to face stiff competition from streaming leaders like Netflix NFLX, Walt Disney DIS and Warner Bros Discovery WBD.Both Netflix and Disney are set to launch their ad-tier subscriptions by the end of this year. These low-cost subscription plans are expected to improve their subscriber growth.Netflix added 2.41 million new paid subscribers in third quarter fiscal 2022 and expects to add 4.5 million paid members in the next quarter with a 6% year-over-year increase in its average revenue per member.Disney reported a total of 164.2 million Disney+ global subscribers in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, an increase of 12 million subscriber from the previous quarter.Warner Bros saw streaming subscriptions rise to nearly 95 million combined global customers across HBO, HBO Max and Discovery+ in third-quarter fiscal 2022. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Discovery WBD signed an agreement regarding the distribution of HBO Max.Notably, Warner Bros. Discovery is bringing back HBO Max to Prime Video Channels after a year-long suspension, thus reversing the decision to end the distribution deal with Amazon in 2021.The recent deal will allow Prime members to access HBO Max for $14.99 per month and enjoy streaming the robust portfolio of movies, television, and original HBO content.Additionally, the recent deal will also enable Prime subscribers to access the streaming service that WBD intends to launch next year. Notably, the new streaming service will be a combination of HBO and Discovery content.We note that the latest deal is likely to deliver an enhanced streaming experience to customers. This will help Amazon attract subscribers to its Prime platform.This in turn will contribute well to subscription revenues as well as the overall top-line growth of Amazon. This will aid the e-commerce giant in gaining investors’ confidence in the near term.In third-quarter 2022, Amazon witnessed 9% growth in its subscription service sales, which stood at $8.9 billion.Coming to the price performance, Amazon has lost 46.9% on a year-to-date basis.Amazon.com, Inc.

QuoteGrowing Streaming Efforts – Key CatalystAmazon has been making solid endeavors to bolster its presence in the booming streaming market.Apart from the latest move, the company’s acquisition of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) movie company remains its second-largest buyout after the Whole Foods acquisition.The MGM buyout has brought MGM’s catalog of 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows to Prime Video, which includes 12 Angry Men, Basic Instinct, Legally Blonde, Moonstruck, Fargo, Vikings, The Magnificent Seven, Shark Tank, Survivor, The Real Housewives, The Pink Panther and the James Bond series.This apart, Amazon’s robust content portfolio remains a major positive. Its one of the much-awaited content - The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, proved to be a mega hit in the third quarter. It has a viewer base of over 100 million to date. Further, there were more than 25 million viewers.Moreover, the rising number of local originals across the world is driving the company’s Prime momentum.Story continuesCompetitive ScenarioAll the above-mentioned endeavors make Amazon well-poised to capitalize on the growth prospects in the streaming market further.Per a Fortune Business Insights report, the global video streaming market is expected to hit $473.4 billion in 2022 and reach $1.69 trillion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 19.9% between 2022 and 2029.This apart, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s deepening focus toward enriching its content portfolio is expected to provide it a competitive advantage in the streaming market against players like Netflix NFLX and Disney DIS, which are also making concerted efforts to strengthen their presence in this market.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, Netflix, the dominant market player, continues to make heavy investments in producing and distributing localized, foreign-language content to offer a diversified content portfolio.Its acquisition of global rights of the documentary Descendant remains a major positive. Its Roald Dahl Story Company buyout, which has added some world-famous characters to Netflix’s portfolio, is also noteworthy.Further, Netflix’s partnership with Dark Horse Entertainment remains another positive. Per the extended partnership, Dark Horse will continue to give Netflix a first look at its IP for both film and TV. Dark Horse projects in development with Netflix include Revenge, Inc. and Lady Killer.Then again, Disney is benefiting from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering.Its efforts toward the creation of a new hub for international content creation to boost the expanding pipeline of local and regional content for its streaming services remain noteworthy. The extension plan would support the worldwide expansion of the company’s direct-to-consumer business.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

120,3b41c1c8-27c0-39dc-b2e7-f7a9429d847b,TJX,2022-12-08,Here's What's Concerning About TJX Companies' (NYSE:TJX) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-whats-concerning-tjx-companies-110010417.html,1670410810,STORY,['TJX'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on TJX Companies is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$4.6b ÷ (US$28b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Therefore, TJX Companies has an ROCE of 27%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 18% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured TJX Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at TJX Companies, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 46% where it was five years ago. However it looks like TJX Companies might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesIn Conclusion...To conclude, we've found that TJX Companies is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 131% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.TJX Companies does have some risks, we noticed   2 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

122,47070c94-e2d6-3fe4-b6f1-ac2d3186bbaa,AMGN,2022-12-08,Mirati (MRTX) Down After 1st-Line Lung Cancer Data on Adagrasib,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mirati-mrtx-down-1st-line-155703476.html,1670428623,STORY,"['MRTX', 'MRK', 'AMGN']","[Shares of Mirati Therapeutics MRTX were down 23% after it announced preliminary data from first-line lung cancer studies on its KRAS inhibitor drug adagrasib plus Merck’s MRK PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda.The KRYSTAL-7 phase II study evaluated adagrasib plus Keytruda for the treatment of previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients harboring a KRASG12C mutation across all PD-L1 subgroups.Data from the study showed that adagrasib plus Keytruda led to promising preliminary clinical activity across all PD-L1 subgroups with an objective response rate (ORR) of 49% among patients who were clinically evaluable and received at least one on-study scan. The combination of this KRASG12C inhibitor and a PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitor showed a good safety profile.In the first-line NSCLC cohort of another study, KRYSTAL-1 phase Ib, the ORR was 57% and the disease control rate was 100% among the seven evaluable patients enrolled in the study.Mirati said that the data from cohorts of both studies showed that the combination of this KRASG12C inhibitor and a PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitor could offer a chemotherapy-free option for treating first-line NSCLC patients. Based on this data, Mirati plans to initiate phase III studies.However, investors seem unimpressed with the data readout and are questioning if adagrasib is commercially viable for first-line treatment of NSCLC. The ORR of 49% seen in the KRYSTAL-7 study is generally in line with chemotherapy + Keytruda, which showed around 48% ORR across all PD-L1 subgroups in the KEYNOTE-189 study. Keytruda + chemotherapy is the current standard of care in first-line NSCLC. However, a matured dataset is needed, including overall survival and progression-free survival data, to make any meaningful comparison to the standard of care.This year so far, the stock price of Mirati has plunged 51.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 17.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesMirati has long been a takeover target and last month the stock was up on rumors that big cancer drugmakers may offer to buy the company. Mirati’s new drug application (NDA), seeking approval for adagrasib for previously-treated KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC is under review with the FDA. A decision by the FDA is expected by Dec 14, 2022. A marketing authorization application is also under review in Europe.Potential buyers could be Pfizer, Bristol-Myers BMY, Merck or AstraZeneca, per an article on Investor's Business Daily. Mirati did not issue any press release or make any comment on the buyout speculations. There are currently no formal offers and a deal is not imminent.Mirati is evaluating adagrasib — both as monotherapy and combinations — in multiple cohorts of phase I/II KRYSTAL-1 study across multiple solid tumors that harbor KRAS G12C mutations. Other than the combination of adagrasib with Merck’s Keytruda in NSCLC, as discussed above, adagrasib is being evaluated in combination with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Gilotrif (afatinib) in advanced NSCLC and Bristol-Myers’ Erbitux (cetuximab) in advanced colorectal cancer or CRC.Adagrasib, if approved, will face competition from Amgen’s AMGN KRAS G12C inhibitor, Lumakras, which was approved for second-line NSCLC in the United States in 2021 and Europe in January 2022. It is now launched in more than 45 countries. Amgen’s Lumakras is off to an excellent start, while its label expansion studies, which have the potential to significantly expand the currently addressable patient population, are progressing rapidly.Earlier this year, Amgen announced data from a phase Ib study, which included mostly pre-treated NSCLC population, combining Lumakras with immunotherapy [Tecentriq (atezolizumab) or Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab)]. The study showed an ORR of 29% in this patient group. However, in the study, Amgen reported that Lumakras with immunotherapy led to higher enzyme elevations.Zacks RankMirati currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

123,1bec8417-9929-3fb2-a549-753b45db427b,AMGN,2022-12-08,Those who invested in Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) five years ago are up 86%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-amgen-nasdaq-amgn-140103228.html,1670421663,STORY,['AMGN'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) share price is up 61% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 42% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 38% , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Amgen While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 2.8% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 10% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Amgen, it has a TSR of 86% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Amgen has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 38% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Amgen better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Amgen , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course Amgen may not be the best stock to buy.

You really can’t be blamed for not being in the Christmas spirit this year. The stock market’s challenging 2022 took a toll on a lot of portfolios, leaving many investors feeling more like a Grinch than looking for new stocks to buy.But there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon – think of it as Rudolph’s red nose, lighting the way for Santa to bring some better tidings for the holiday season.After all, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has nearly clawed its way back to the black. It’s down only 5% on the year now, after spending much of 2022 flirting with bear territory. That’s progress.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd if you look toward the future you can see a chance for greater profits. After a weak year, many stocks are discounted heavily right now. Others – particularly energy stocks – are flying high and still have a long runway to bring in exaggerated returns.So, grab some egg nog, pull your chair up to the fire and take a look at some Christmas stocks to buy.

Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is benefiting from higher energy costs brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty for oil and natural gas production.OXY stock is up a whopping 137% in 2022 and shows zero signs of slowing down, making it one of the Christmas stocks to buy for continued growth. The consensus price target of $77.50 indicates that Occidental has at least another 12% runway.The company did have a minor misstep in its last earnings report, missing analysts’ estimates on earnings per share by 2 cents. The company topped revenue estimates handily, bringing in $9.5 billion versus expectations of $9.05 billion. But EPS was $2.44 when the Street expected $2.46.Story continuesThat wasn’t enough to damage Occidental’s grade in the Portfolio Grader – my free tool that measures stocks by quantitative factors plus momentum, analyst sentiments, earnings performance and other factors and assigns a letter grade.

The mammoth energy company (it has a market capitalization of more than $450 billion), is up 81% in 2022. And that includes a 16% hike in just the last three months.Citi analyst Alastair Syme raised the firm’s price target on XOM stock recently from $98 to $110, saying that even though energy stocks are at or near all-time highs, energy stocks still have room to run.Exxon is working to keep the profits coming by reducing operating costs and then passing the savings on to investors via stock buybacks and dividends, making it one of the best dividend Christmas stocks to buy. Third-quarter earnings were $112.07 billion, beating expectations of $104.76 billion.

DVN may not be as well-known. But it’s been a solid winner so far this year and there’s every reason to believe that will continue.The Oklahoma-based oil and natural gas exploration company is up 55% so far this year. While oil and natural gas aren’t expected to return to their 2022 highs, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says prices will still be above levels seen in the late 2010s and early 2020s.That will keep the dollars rolling in for Devon, which brought in $5.43 billion in revenue and $2.18 EPS in the third quarter. Analysts were expecting $4.79 billion in revenue of and EPS of $2.13.On top of that, DVN provides an amazing dividend yield of 8%, giving investors yet another reason to buy and hold. DVN stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Amgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) doesn’t have the mammoth dividend yield offered by Devon – it offers less than 3%. But it’s still one of the best dividend Christmas stocks you can buy. In fact, I recently identified Amgen as one of my best dividend stocks to buy for 2023.The biotech company is a leader in providing treatment for some well-known and debilitating ailments, including bone cancer, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. As long as it keeps that pipeline of medications rolling in through its R&amp;D, Amgen stock will be a winner.In September, it announced updated long-term positive data about the effectiveness of its Repatha drug that treats high cholesterol.Q3 earnings included revenue of $6.65 billion and EPS of $4.70, both better than expectations of $6.55 billion and $4.45 EPS. That helps give AMGN stock an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.T-Mobile US (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: ShutterstockI’ll be the first to confess my appreciation for 5G technology – and in turn, top 5G stocks. I think that 5G is a game-changing development because of how it will improve our everyday lives.T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock is up more than 30% so far this year and it’s beating the tar out of its biggest competitors. The company is rolling out its 5G network and growing its subscriber base – in Q3, it added 854,000 postpaid phone subscribers, beating expectations for 739,000.In comparison, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) added 8,000 in the quarter.Revenue for the third quarter was slightly less than expected — $19.48 billion versus expectations of $19.98 billion. But the earnings per share was a huge beat, coming in at $2.27 while the Street expected only EPS of 50 cents.TMUS is a stock to watch, and it has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR)Petrobras distributor in the industry and supply sector.. PBR stockSource: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.comBrazil-based Petroleo Brasileiro (NYSE:PBR) is in a unique spot. The company, known also as Petrobras, is facing some volatility because of the change in the president’s office.The Brazilian government controls Petrobras, and outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro’s business plan for Petrobras could be shuttered on Jan. 1.Incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said that Petrobras should invest beyond fossil fuels. His representatives also reportedly have asked Petrobras to suspend the planned sale of its Manaus refinery.Shares are down by 12% in the last month, bringing the company’s year-to-date return to less than 3%. But that also means that PBR stock is significantly discounted and is in a prime position to provide some outsized returns next year.Make no mistake – there’s a lot of money to be had with PBR. The company brought in $170 billion in revenue in the third quarter, beating expectations of $162.08 billion. And EPS of $3.56 was much better than expectations of $1.06 per share.PBR is an intriguing stock right now, and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAs one of the biggest and best-known defense contractors in the world, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is seeing strong returns because of continuing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, and between the U.S. and China, North Korea and Russia.Just in the last two days, LMT won a $430 million Army contract and a $139 million Missile Defense Agency contract.

If you want to read about some more gold stocks, go directly to 5 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For Recession.According to a report by S&amp;P Global, the sentiments for gold investment have risen over the past few months due to higher inflation and increasing geopolitical risks surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since early March 2022, gold price has hit a 19-month high of around $2,039/oz and has stabilized around $1,900/oz. In most major economies, inflation has reached multi-decade highs and central banks are struggling to set it to the target range of 2%-3%, further fueling the demand for the precious commodity. In October, as inflation appeared to be peaking and the market started growth numbers again, the price of gold fell 2% to US$1,639/oz due to the rising dollar strength. Latest research shows that the global gold mining market will grow from $214.1 billion in 2021 to $249.6 billion by 2026, at a compound annual growth rate of 3.1% for the period of 2021-2026. Some of the top stocks in the gold market that elite investors are using to profit off this gold boom include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV). Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the gold sector and are best positioned to offer investors some solidity amid rising recession fears were selected for the list.

SSR Mining’s stock has fallen significantly this year due to lower precious metal prices and the temporary closure of its Copler mine. We repurchased its shares in late September after the Copler mine restarted on schedule since the stock remained depressed. SSR Mining should generate significant free cash flow at current gold and silver prices and has a very strong balance sheet with over $600 million in net cash and $4.1 billion in stockholders’ equity.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Dips, Albeit Not by MuchBy James RubinIn soccer World Cup terms, bitcoin's performance the past 10 days would be the equivalent of a 0-0 draw.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization isn't losing or gaining much ground. On Wednesday, BTC was recently trading at about $16,850. That was down more than 1% over the past 24 hours but didn't offer much variance from its perch since late November when bitcoin established support above $17,000.In an interview with CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" TV program, Joe Orsini, vice president of research at digital asset management platform Eaglebrook Advisors, attributed bitcoin's toughness to an at least temporary slowdown in bad news stemming from the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and other crypto fiascos this year.""When it comes to the unexpected, no news is good news,"" Orsini said. ""We've had a few things play out since the FTX news, of course, the BlockFi bankruptcy that was relatively priced in knowing they kind of relied on that FTX-Alameda bailout, as well as now you have concerns with some of the lenders. But it's been slow to play out, and there hasn't been that second wave of shock.""Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,230, off 2.8% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red, albeit not by much, as investors continued to gnaw on recent economic indicators suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy had not taken as big a bite out of inflation as was hoped. SUSHI, the token of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap was recently off more than 8%, while popular meme coin DOGE fell more than 3.5%.Story continuesThe CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, tumbled 1.59%.Cryptos roughly tracked U.S. equity markets, which were most down, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 dropping 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, amid inflationary fears, although stocks performance improved over the steeper drops of the previous two days. Markets received an extra whiff of encouragement on Wednesday when China announced it was dropping its harshest Covid restrictions. China's measures to limit mortalities from the disease have been slowing the economic growth of the world's second largest economy by GDP.Eaglebrook Advisors' Orsini said that additional contagion could unsettle markets. ""The important thing to consider is if the news does come, and if there is real contagion, does it lead to forced selling or liquidations or stronger selling pressure?"" he asked, although he remained upbeat about a crypto rebound.""Price does have a knack for changing sentiment,"" he said. ""When things are on sale, people want them less. We believe in the long run that these event-driven declines have very little meaning to underlying technology. Bitcoin has specific characteristics that it a really attractive form of money, and potentially to take market share away from fiat. And with Etherium, the ability to automate transactions, and the quality of entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem is not changing.""Orsini added: ""Cycles happen, and so we've been in a bear market for about 13 months, and those (bear markets) were where the opportunities lie for long-term investors.""Biggest GainersThere are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.Biggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorCosmosATOM−5.3%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL−4.9%Smart Contract PlatformGalaGALA−4.8%EntertainmentInsightsHow will FTX Contagion Affect Sino Global Capital?By Sam ReynoldsConnections between Sino Global Capital’s Liquid Value Fund, its first fund for outside investment, and Sam Bankman-Fried as well as Alameda Research, might mean the venture capital fund is mentioned in FTX’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings, according to a Hong Kong lawyer who specializes in asset tracing.According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Sino Global’s Liquid Value counts Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda as general partners and co-owners of the fund.In a prior comment to The Block, Matthew Graham, Sino Global’s founder, who has been historically closely aligned with SBF and FTX, said that a “substantial” portion of the Liquid Value fund’s $200 million had been committed by FTX and other partners.According to a recent report by the Financial Times, which detailed all of Alameda’s investments, the Bankman-Fried-affiliated fund put $60 million into Sino Global’s Liquid Value Fund. An unknown amount was then contributed by SBF himself.These events will complicate FTX and Alameda’s process in their bankruptcy hearings, says Stephen Chan, a partner at Hong Kong-based law firm Ince.“If they are in a partnership, all partners share in the upside and the downside,” Chan said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The other partners may incur liability for the actions of SBF and Alameda.”A material amount of Alameda’s balance sheet was made up of FTX’s FTT token, as CoinDesk previously reported, which it used for collateral on investments. If Alameda funded part, or all, of its contribution to Sino Global’s Liquid Value fund via FTT, then this pool of assets – and whatever they were invested in – would be a part of what’s available to creditors.If it turns out that SBF and his cohorts were committing fraud and some of SBF’s partners were in knowing receipt of proceeds of fraud, Chan explained, there would be a slightly different route under Hong Kong common law (the fund is domiciled there, and FTX/Alameda had a significant presence in the territory).“If SBF is a general partner, then the partnership may have liability,” Chan said.In instances of fraud, liquidators working on the FTX-Alameda case may look to recipients of proceeds of fraud to see whether civil recovery is possible.But all of this might be challenging, to say the least. Sino Global is heavily invested in Solana and its respective infrastructure.CoinGecko data shows that Solana has suffered a 93% loss during the last year, and in the weeks following FTX’s collapse nearly $700 million in locked-in value has been wiped out from Solana decentralized finance protocols.The token of Orca, a Solana-based decentralized exchange that is one of Sino Global’s leading portfolio companies, reached a high of $20 in October 2021; it is now worth just over 40 cents. Its total value locked went from $1.4 billion at its height to $43.15 million today, according to DeFiLlama.FTX’s FTT token is currently trading at $1.51, up 14% during the last two weeks, but down 95% on the month. Recently, its contract deployer has dumped the entirety of the locked FTT tokens into circulation, effectively flooding the market with what is already a token of questionable value.Important events8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC) Australia Trade Balance (MoM/Oct)8:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:00 UTC) European Central Bank's President Christine Lagarde Speech9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Initial Jobless ClaimsCoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Dips Under $17K; Sam Bankman-Fried Hires Attorney Mark Cohen: ReportFormer FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has hired high-profile defense attorney Mark Cohen, the same attorney who represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex-trafficking trial, according to Reuters.

It has been slightly edited for clarity.Francis Gannon: Welcome, everyone. This is Francis Gannon, Co-Chief Investment Officer at Royce Investment Partners. Thank you for joining us. Im thrilled to have a conversation with Charlie Dreifus, portfolio manager of the Royce Small-cap Special Equity Fund. We're going to look back at performance in this volatile period and look forward to seeing what opportunities that volatility is creating for the Small-cap Special Equity Fund.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with M. Click here to check it out. M 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MPeter Lynch Chart of MI should note that Special Equity is outperforming its benchmark. The Russell 2000 value index for the 1-, 3-, 5-, 15-year, and since inception periods going back to May 1st, 1998, through the end of the third quarter of this year. The Fund has a strong history of down-market results, and this year has been no different. Charlie lets begin with your current thoughts on this environment, especially around this idea of cooling inflation, which has been getting a lot of run in the headlines of late.Charlie Dreifus: My pleasure, Frank, and thank you for the opportunity to speak with everyone. Theres increasing evidence that weve had weve hit peak inflation. What we have not, in my opinion, hit, is peak interest rates. And theres a lot of optimism and enthusiasm about, you know, lower inflation numbers and so forth. Indeed, the Fed will likely increase by smaller increments and perhaps even pause. To me, a pivota true pivotmeans reducing rates, not merely lowering the rate of increase or pausing.Investors should be mindful of the destination, meaning what the terminal rate that the Fed is trying to accomplish or thinks it needs to accomplish rather than the journey. The journey can change over time, but its clear to me at this point that the Fed sees their obligation to continue to be on the aggressive side regarding taming inflation.Story continuesFG: Lets spend a second on that on your comment there, Charlie, about the journey. Many people are expecting earnings to continue to decline, especially going into the first half of next year as we enter a recessioneither mild or deep is to be determined. But many people believe that the market has not yet seen its bottom. What are your thoughts on that?CD: I too, dont believe weve seen the bottom. The usual characteristics of a bottomreally widening junk bond spreads, higher VIX numbers, and earnings estimates dramatically coming down. None of that has really appeared to any significant degree. And so, its interestingpreliminary data for the third quarter shows how margins are being compressed. Sales were up nearly three times what earnings were. Earnings declines will likely be dramatic, and with the fourth quarter results, or the preannouncements to them, were likely to see a substantial reduction in the earnings estimates for 2023.We also usually at a market bottom have some calamity. And some might argue that weve seen that in crypto. I dont see it being widespread enough in terms of the traditional counterparty risks and bringing other entities down with them so I dont think weve seen a bottom, but the further correction can be one of two kinds. Ive seen corrections over time, which means that earnings take a while to catch up to valuations. And that can last and has lasted in the past for a decade. Thus, the term lost decade. It can also be much more forceful and quicker with a 20-30% washout. The desperation, the capitulation, people are just disgusted, dont want to own equities, dumping them irrespective of valuation, yield, whatever.FG: Charlie, much is being made of the fact that the multiple compression weve seen this year has really come from price, and the next shoe to drop is earning. What are your current thoughts on valuation?CD: Well, small-caps benefit by virtue of them being less, foreign sourced, or saying it the opposite way, more U.S.-centric in terms of their revenues and earnings, which, relative to some parts of the world means better business conditions, but also less of a hurt from currency. We dont know how long and how high inflation will continue, but I think that's an interesting observation. And finally, Ive seen data that shows that on the next 12-month earnings basis small-caps are selling one standard deviation below their traditional valuation to large caps. So, there are a lot of arguments to favor small-caps currently.FG: Can you talk about two specific holdings in the Fund?CD: Sure. And here again, I have been known to be a contrarian. I do prowl the new low list. We do screen for severe characteristics. So, we ask the companies that we populate the portfolio with to meet a very stringent and difficult set of metrics. Consistent with sort of the contrarian approach, two names that I want to discuss are the in the discretionary area and peoples first reaction would be, Were going into recession, and you know we have this high inflation. Why would you want to be in, you know, consumer discretionary? And the answer is valuation. So, this is a time to look at retailers, manufacturers of consumer items that they sell through others.And in that light, there are two names Id like to highlight. One is Macys (NYSE:M), obviously a traditional department store but well beyond that, they have a thriving e-commerce business. And theyve done an incredibly good job because of expenditures, which were monitoring, in the IT, in their software, and in their data manipulation of consumer trends. They have not gotten stuck with the high inventories that other retailers have faced. Theyve navigated this with some skill, and they will be the first to concede that a lot of that comes from this intelligence theyre getting from these proprietary screens that theyre using.The company also has a real estate component. They own a lot of their real estate, albeit less valuable than it would have been a couple of years ago, but it still has value. And they have, which is not often found, an overfunded pension plan in the retail space. And most importantly, and again consistent with being greedy when others are fearful, its selling at an incredibly low valuation.The other one would be in a sort of a similar componentin fact, they sell to Macy's. Its Movado (NYSE:MOV). Its perceived as a watch company, although they are also in costume jewelry. Theyre known for their brands Movado and EBEL. But they also do a lot of private label under names like Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Coach, and so forth. They wholesale to other retailers as well as selling in their own stores and online.They are making strides and expanding at a fairly rapid pace. Their costume jewelry offerings, which have been well received, and, importantly, an incredibly inexpensive and very conscious, conservative management. In fact, on the most recent earnings call, they highlightedand its something were watching; theres no truly perfect stockand here theyre facing and seeing North American weakness. Sales outside of the U.S. are doing quite well. Its within North America that sales are a bit lackluster or actually down.So, despite that, the company gave forward guidance with a very good earnings number, making the stock very attractive. This company, after the year ends, after their inventories and receivables turn to cash, has an incredible balance sheet, the likes of which would entice Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s mentor Ben Graham because it would qualify as a net-net working capital candidate.FG: One last question before we let you go: Whats your outlook on the market over the next 12 months?CD: I dont think weve seen the bottom. So, I think the market again could go sideways. I have trouble coming up with a scenario where the market, on a sustained basis rather than these rallies that weve seen, is done and is on its path higher on a consistent basis. One outcome could be that correction in time; the other outcome is a more dramatic, deeper correction. So, I think thats ahead of us.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Gensler, who declined to specifically talk about failed crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said in an interview on Yahoo! Finance that the SEC has the basic disclosure and governance requirements in place to hold digital-assets firms accountable.The SEC chief also didn’t directly address questions about whether his agency would push out tailored crypto rules next year, but he insisted that it doesn’t need any. “The rules are there,” he said. “The law firms know how to advise their clients to comply.”FTX’s crash showed the dangers of running a global platform without walls between customer funds and investment operations, Gensler said. Crypto firms can’t do everything. “Your field will not last long outside of public policy norms,” he said.The court case over whether Ripple’s XRP is a security has been seen as the major lingering question holding the agency back, but Gensler said Wednesday that a federal judge’s decision last month determining that crypto startup LBRY violated securities laws by selling its native LBC tokens was a “very big win” for the SEC’s legal campaign.So far, the SEC hasn’t directly gone after U.S. exchange Coinbase (COIN) for listing what the agency believes are securities without registering as a national securities exchange. Still, the SEC has – in another recent enforcement action – listed several tokens it considers unregistered securities that were traded on the company’s platform.Token Roundup(CoinDesk Research)Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,800, down about a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has held comfortably above $17,000 for much of the past nine days, despite ongoing investor jitters about contagion linked to the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly signs since late last week that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to maintain its hawkish course on interest rate hikes through 2023.Story continuesSushiSwap (SUSHI): The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is facing a significant deficit in its treasury that threatens its long-term operational viability, according to a governance proposal from project developers. After reviewing expenditures, the project's annual runway requirement was reduced from $9 million to $5 million, but the treasury still provides for only about 18 months of runway, developers said.Axie Infinity (AXS): The native token of the blockchain-based play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, has come out of oblivion this week with a double-digit price rally. Yet, leverage traders appear skeptical if AXS' turnaround from 17-month lows would be longlasting. That's because while open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active standard futures and perpetual futures contracts tied to AXS, has increased to a three-month high of $129.70 million, funding rates remain negative, according to data source Coinglass.Latest PricesCoinDesk Market Index (CMI)850.81 −11.4 ▼ 1.3%  Bitcoin (BTC)$16,814 −174.0 ▼ 1.0%  Ethereum (ETH)$1,230 −25.5 ▼ 2.0%  S&amp;P 500 daily close3,933.92 −7.3 ▼ 0.2%  Gold$1,799 +29.4 ▲ 1.7%  Treasury Yield 10 Years3.41% ▼ 0.1  BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price.

If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter. Increased short-term rates and slower economic growth lead to lower demand and prices for physical and digital assets.10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Constant Maturity (Fred Database)Read the full technical take here.Other NewsCoinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brian Armstong said the company’s revenue will be about half what it was last year as the crypto exchange struggles amid stark price drops in cryptocurrencies and continuing ripple effects from multiple bankruptcies this year, including the recent collapse of rival exchange FTX. Armstrong noted in an interview with Bloomberg’s David Rubenstein that Coinbase had done about $7 billion in revenue ($7.8 billion, according to FactSet) and $4 billion in positive EBITDA. “It's looking, you know, about roughly half that or less,” Armstrong said.Genesis interim CEO Derar Islim wrote in a letter to customers Wednesday that resolution of his company’s lending unit’s withdrawal freeze is likely to be a matter of “weeks” rather than days. The lending arm of Genesis in November was forced to suspend redemptions following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. This morning’s note from Islim said Genesis is committed to being as “transparent as possible” with customers and that it is working in consultation with highly experienced advisers and in close collaboration with its owner, Digital Currency Group.

An inversion in the U.S. yield curve was also perceived by several market participants as an indicator of an impending recession.But while gold has largely lost its safe haven status this year, speculation that the dollar has peaked this year weighed on the greenback drove recent flows into the yellow metal.Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,783.11 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,795.15 an ounce by 20:17 ET (01:17 GMT). Both instruments rallied nearly 1% each on Wednesday, amid growing concerns over a U.S. recession.Focus this week is on U.S. producer inflation data for November, due on Friday, to gauge the path of price pressures in the country.While inflation eased in October, it still remained well above the Federal Reserve’s target range. Signs of strength in consumer spending and the jobs market also raised concerns over inflation remaining stickier than expected in the coming months.Such a scenario is likely to invite more hawkish moves by the Fed. While the central bank is expected to hike rates by a smaller margin next week, it has warned that U.S. rates could peak at higher-than-expected levels in the face of stubborn inflation.Rising U.S. interest rates weighed heavily on gold prices this year, and a hawkish outlook from the Fed is likely to further dent the yellow metal.Among industrial metals, copper prices were flat on Thursday after two straight days of gains, amid optimism over an economic reopening in China.Copper futures steadied around $3.8448 a pound after rising nearly 1% in the past two sessions.China announced the further relaxation of anti-COVID curbs this week, driving up hopes of an eventual economic recovery in the world’s largest copper importer.Story continuesBut the country is still struggling with record-high daily increases in infections. Slowing economic growth in the rest of the world could also potentially weigh on copper demand in the near-term, keeping prices subdued.Related ArticlesGold hovers below $1,800, recession fears spur some safe haven demandPutin acknowledges Russia's war in Ukraine could be a long oneOil prices steady after hitting 2022 lows]"

We are looking to bring people with the capability to advise the board on investment decisions,"" he told reporters after the meeting, adding that the objective is to accelerate plans in the area.Demand for metals like nickel and lithium is seen growing sharply in coming years due to expected production growth of electric vehicles (EV). Those are the main metals used in the batteries.Vale is particularly looking to be well placed to supply the EV growth in North America.Pimenta did not give financial details of the deal, or any comment on how much the 10% share would cost. He said more information on the modeling of the business would be available to the market in the first quarter of 2023.Demand for copper is also expected to rise globally due to the energy transition towards more electrification.(This story has been corrected to fix the role of Gustavo Pimenta to Chief Financial Officer, and not Chief Executive, in the first paragraph)(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Sandra Maler)]"

AlphaWise, the proprietary survey and data arm of Morgan Stanley Research, carried out a survey of about 2500 pet owners in June. The survey shows that “fur babies” have made a permanent place in the hearts and households of their owners, significantly affecting spending patterns of pet parents across the US and worldwide.On the household level, Morgan Stanley forecasts spending to rise to $1,320 per pet by 2025, and this figure will reach $1,897 by 2030. Comparatively, the prior outlook for spending per pet was $1,292 by 2025 and $1,909 by 2030.Simeon Gutman, an equity analyst covering hardline, broadline and food retail at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report dated November 2: “An outcome in line with this expectation would increase total spending in the industry by 134% over the next decade, from $118 billion in 2019 to $277 billion by 2030.”Gutman added further: “As Millennials become homeowners, delay having children and increasingly have smaller families, they tend to spend more on their pets than older pet owners do, especially on premium food and services. The increase in ownership during the pandemic was driven primarily by this cohort, and they are likely to accelerate the trends toward treating pets like humans and providing premium care. As a result, the COVID benefit to the pet industry likely has a long tail.”Some of the best pet stocks to consider for exposure to one of the quickest growing industries include Chewy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TRUP) is a Washington-based provider of medical insurance for cats and dogs on a monthly subscription basis in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Australia. The company serves pet owners and veterinarians. Trupanion, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUP) is one of the best pet stocks to monitor. The Q3 2022 revenue of $233.76 million increased 28.7% year-over-year and beat market estimates by $3.65 million. Subscription enrolled pets were 808,077 on September 30, 2022, an increase of 19% over the third quarter of 2021.On November 4, Lake Street analyst Mark Argento maintained a Buy rating on Trupanion, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUP) but lowered the price target on the shares to $67 from $112. While noting that Trupanion, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUP) ""posted another quarter of strong revenue growth,"" the analyst thinks it may take ""a few quarters"" for margins to normalize. He would use weakness as a buying opportunity, citing Trupanion, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUP)’s ""defensible, market-leading, and mass-market inflecting model"". According to Insider Monkey’s data, 11 hedge funds were bullish on Trupanion, Inc.

Trupanion provides pet insurance to help owners budget for vet expenses if their pet needs care. While pet insurance has historically been a bad product with confusing, if not misleading, coverage that left pet owners and veterinarians distrustful of pet insurance, Trupanion simplified the product by providing comprehensive coverage and increased transparency to help customers and vets understand the value proposition.Trupanion’s competitive advantage primarily comes from being a low-cost provider. It integrates all the parts of the value chain that matter which creates efficiencies and a better customer experience. Unlike most competitors, Trupanion underwrites its own policies and doesn’t reinsure their policies. They have their own call centers, a national sales force of Territory Partners, and process their own claims. The combination of these efforts reduces operating costs by ~20% relative to peers. These savings are used to offer customers higher payout ratios (~70% of premiums earned are paid out in vet claims) compared to an average of 50% for peers. This naturally attracts more customers over time which helps Trupanion scale operating costs further, which can further be share with customers. Other factors like the relationships that Territory Partners have with vets and hospitals, which typically take 2-3 years to build through repeated visits and its integrated automated claims software called Trupanion Express all feed into building its durable competitive advantage…” (Click here to see the full text)9.

(NYSE:BARK) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $5 from $8.

(NYSE:BARK) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 17 funds in the last quarter.

Specifically, Heska sells blood testing and supplies, digital imaging products, software and single-use products primarily for cats and dogs. The company also offers private-label vaccines and pharmaceutical production primarily for cattle and other small mammals.Shares of Heska underperformed this quarter largely due to an industry-wide slowdown in the animal health market. The company reported lower than expected earnings results due to the recent weakness in vet visitation trends. Consequently, management lowered forward guidance given the difficult macroeconomic outlook. While near-term weakness is expected at this time, we believe the company remains well positioned to benefit from new product launches going into next year.”7. PetMed Express, Inc. (NASDAQ:PETS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15PetMed Express, Inc. (NASDAQ:PETS) is a Florida-based company that operates as a pet pharmacy in the United States.

The analyst expects partnership &amp; M&amp;A announcements over the coming quarter, but said the key to stock performance will be a sustained recovery in new customer growth, which could take time given PetMed Express, Inc. (NASDAQ:PETS)’s ""challenged competitive position.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 15 hedge funds were long PetMed Express, Inc. (NASDAQ:PETS) at the end of September 2022, compared to 11 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 233,095 shares worth $4.55 million. Here is what Silver Ring Value Partners has to say about PetMed Express, Inc. (NASDAQ:PETS) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“PETS was one of the original online sellers of pet medication directly to consumers. Once upon a time this was a growing business, given that they offered much lower prices than those which could be obtained at the vet’s office. However, with Chewy’s entry into the pet pharmacy business and Covetrus’s online offering that allows vets to sell drugs online at only a small premium to PETS’s prices, the value of PETS’s customer proposition has greatly diminished.The company has been squeezed out of obtaining new customers through paid search by Chewy’s massive ad blitz. This is a situation that is likely long-term in nature. As a result, PETS’s business has entered into a decline in terms of both existing and new customers. This is a trend that I view as likely to continue over the long-term. Essentially, there is no longer a strong reason for PETS to exist as a business – it is neither the lowest priced nor the most differentiated, and is facing bigger competitors that are muscling it out of the business.As a result of these structural changes, I believe the business is going to continue to decline for a long time, resulting in a far smaller business value than the recent price. I purchased a small put option position during the quarter. My plan is to stick to a total budget of no more than 2% cumulatively over the life of the investment. I will be monitoring new information, and if my thesis appears to be validated by the facts, I will likely continue with the position up until the 2% threshold.”6. Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF) is a California-based health and wellness company focused on improving the lives of pets, pet parents, and its Petco partners.

(NASDAQ:WOOF) but lowered the price target on the shares to $16 from $17. The company reported a ""solid"" comp growth and its in-line margins led to a ""better than feared"" quarter, though its exposure to variable rate debt and uncertainty around sponsor ownership weigh on the stock, the analyst told investors.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 16 hedge funds were bullish on Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF), compared to 21 funds in the prior quarter. Like Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX), and Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF) is one of the best pet stocks to invest in. Baron Funds made the following comment about Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF) is a pet supply retail chain. Shares were down during the quarter as the company reported earnings that missed analyst expectations. Strong sales in pet food and pet services (two categories that tend to be less discretionary) were more than offset by softer-than-expected sales in non-essential supplies and companion animals (both of which tend to be more discretionary). Given management’s expectation for continued consumer spending softness, the company lowered profit guidance for the remainder of the year. While pet food and pet services carry a higher lifetime value for Petco, these categories are also lower margin and so the mix shift towards these categories will be a short-term drag on profitability. Despite these short-term challenges, we remain positive on Petco’s long-term growth prospects. Weakness in supplies and companion animals has been temporary in prior economic slowdowns and, as a result, should rebound over the coming quarters. At the same time, services continue to expand nicely as the company grows its veterinary practices. Lastly, Petco’s new store concept targeting rural communities is off to a strong start, setting the stage for a second growth concept going forward.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Pet Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:11 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy12 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Soros12 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 11 Best Pet Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:ZTS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-zoetis-inc-130010471.html,1670418010,STORY,['ZTS'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.37bUS$2.78bUS$2.91bUS$3.17bUS$3.37bUS$3.53bUS$3.67bUS$3.80bUS$3.91bUS$4.01bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.11%Est @ 4.87%Est @ 4%Est @ 3.4%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$2.2kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$92bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$92b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$49bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$73b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$153, the company appears about fair value at a 1.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy Partners, LP (together with its subsidiaries, NEP) regarding future operating results and other future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of NEP's control. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements concerning NEP's future financing activities. In some cases, you can identify the forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as ""will,"" ""may result,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""seek,"" ""aim,"" ""potential,"" ""projection,"" ""forecast,"" ""predict,"" ""goals,"" ""target,"" ""outlook,"" ""should,"" ""would"" or similar words or expressions.

The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could require NEP to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by wind and solar conditions at its renewable energy projects; operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects and pipelines involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output or capacity, personal injury or loss of life; NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather; NEP depends on certain of the renewable energy projects and pipelines in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; NEP may pursue the repowering of wind projects or the expansion of natural gas pipelines that would require up-front capital expenditures and could expose NEP to project development risks; terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events could impact NEP's projects, pipelines or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; the ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP's projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP's business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP's cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP's renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the Texas pipeline entities' ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between the U.S. and Mexico; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP's rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP's operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and Mexico; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; if the energy production by or availability of NEP's renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP's growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; reductions in demand for natural gas in the United States or Mexico and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP's pipeline operations and cash flows; government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP's growth strategy; NEP's growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; NEP may continue to acquire other sources of clean energy and may expand to include other types of assets. Any further acquisition of non-renewable energy projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utilities, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in North America; the natural gas pipeline industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect NEP's business; NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and pursue other growth opportunities; restrictions in NEP and its subsidiaries' financing agreements could adversely affect NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP's cash distributions to its unitholders may be reduced as a result of restrictions on NEP's subsidiaries' cash distributions to NEP under the terms of their indebtedness or other financing agreements; NEP's subsidiaries' substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect NEP's ability to operate its business, and its failure to comply with the terms of its subsidiaries' indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on NEP's financial condition; NEP is exposed to risks inherent in its use of interest rate swaps; widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEP's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEE has influence over NEP; under the cash sweep and credit support agreement, NEP receives credit support from NEE and its affiliates. NEP's subsidiaries may default under contracts or become subject to cash sweeps if credit support is terminated, if NEE or its affiliates fail to honor their obligations under credit support arrangements, or if NEE or another credit support provider ceases to satisfy creditworthiness requirements, and NEP will be required in certain circumstances to reimburse NEE for draws that are made on credit support; NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NEER) or one of its affiliates is permitted to borrow funds received by NEP's subsidiaries and is obligated to return these funds only as needed to cover project costs and distributions or as demanded by NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP's financial condition and ability to make distributions to its unitholders, as well as its ability to grow distributions in the future, is highly dependent on NEER's performance of its obligations to return all or a portion of these funds; NEER's right of first refusal may adversely affect NEP's ability to consummate future sales or to obtain favorable sale terms; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc. (NEP GP) and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with NEP and have limited duties to NEP and its unitholders; NEP GP and its affiliates and the directors and officers of NEP are not restricted in their ability to compete with NEP, whose business is subject to certain restrictions; NEP may only terminate the Management Services Agreement among, NEP, NextEra Energy Management Partners, LP (NEE Management), NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Operating Partners GP, LLC (NEP OpCo GP) under certain limited circumstances; if the agreements with NEE Management or NEER are terminated, NEP may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms; NEP's arrangements with NEE limit NEE's potential liability, and NEP has agreed to indemnify NEE against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead NEE to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to NEP than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account; NEP's ability to make distributions to its unitholders depends on the ability of NEP OpCo to make cash distributions to its limited partners; if NEP incurs material tax liabilities, NEP's distributions to its unitholders may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of the IDR fee; holders of NEP's units may be subject to voting restrictions; NEP's partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that NEP GP and NEP's directors and officers might have to holders of its common units with contractual standards governing their duties and the NYSE does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like NEP to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements; NEP's partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of NEP's common units for actions taken by NEP's directors or NEP GP that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duties; certain of NEP's actions require the consent of NEP GP; holders of NEP's common units currently cannot remove NEP GP without NEE's consent and provisions in NEP's partnership agreement may discourage or delay an acquisition of NEP that NEP unitholders may consider favorable; NEE's interest in NEP GP and the control of NEP GP may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent; NEP may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute unitholder interests; reimbursements and fees owed to NEP GP and its affiliates for services provided to NEP or on NEP's behalf will reduce cash distributions from NEP OpCo and from NEP to NEP's unitholders, and there are no limits on the amount that NEP OpCo may be required to pay; increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of NEP's common units, NEP's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; the liability of holders of NEP's units, which represent limited partnership interests in NEP, may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of NEP's business; unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them; the issuance of securities convertible into, or settleable with, common units may affect the market price for NEP's common units, will dilute common unitholders' ownership in NEP and may decrease the amount of cash available for distribution for each common unit; NEP's future tax liability may be greater than expected if NEP does not generate net operating losses (NOLs) sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of NEP's tax positions; NEP's ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited; NEP will not have complete control over NEP's tax decisions; and, distributions to unitholders may be taxable as dividends. NEP discusses these and other risks and uncertainties in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and other Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and this news release should be read in conjunction with such SEC filings made through the date of this news release.

The dispersion of these detractors across geographies shows how investing in emerging markets can be idiosyncratic. TPI Composites, Inc. (NASDAQ:TPIC) was the Fund’s largest detractor in the fourth quarter and for the full year. A maker of wind turbine blades, TPI was particularly hard-hit by commodity inflation and challenging supply chains, leading the company to recapitalize in the fourth quarter. While the company continues to face near-term headwinds, this recapitalization should support the company’s long-term position as a leading supplier to the world’s largest wind turbine manufacturers.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Green Energy Stocks to Buy. Suggested Articles:10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy15 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income12 Safest Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Dips, Albeit Not by MuchBy James RubinIn soccer World Cup terms, bitcoin's performance the past 10 days would be the equivalent of a 0-0 draw.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization isn't losing or gaining much ground. On Wednesday, BTC was recently trading at about $16,850. That was down more than 1% over the past 24 hours but didn't offer much variance from its perch since late November when bitcoin established support above $17,000.In an interview with CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" TV program, Joe Orsini, vice president of research at digital asset management platform Eaglebrook Advisors, attributed bitcoin's toughness to an at least temporary slowdown in bad news stemming from the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and other crypto fiascos this year.""When it comes to the unexpected, no news is good news,"" Orsini said. ""We've had a few things play out since the FTX news, of course, the BlockFi bankruptcy that was relatively priced in knowing they kind of relied on that FTX-Alameda bailout, as well as now you have concerns with some of the lenders. But it's been slow to play out, and there hasn't been that second wave of shock.""Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,230, off 2.8% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red, albeit not by much, as investors continued to gnaw on recent economic indicators suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy had not taken as big a bite out of inflation as was hoped. SUSHI, the token of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap was recently off more than 8%, while popular meme coin DOGE fell more than 3.5%.Story continuesThe CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, tumbled 1.59%.Cryptos roughly tracked U.S. equity markets, which were most down, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 dropping 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, amid inflationary fears, although stocks performance improved over the steeper drops of the previous two days. Markets received an extra whiff of encouragement on Wednesday when China announced it was dropping its harshest Covid restrictions. China's measures to limit mortalities from the disease have been slowing the economic growth of the world's second largest economy by GDP.Eaglebrook Advisors' Orsini said that additional contagion could unsettle markets. ""The important thing to consider is if the news does come, and if there is real contagion, does it lead to forced selling or liquidations or stronger selling pressure?"" he asked, although he remained upbeat about a crypto rebound.""Price does have a knack for changing sentiment,"" he said. ""When things are on sale, people want them less. We believe in the long run that these event-driven declines have very little meaning to underlying technology. Bitcoin has specific characteristics that it a really attractive form of money, and potentially to take market share away from fiat. And with Etherium, the ability to automate transactions, and the quality of entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem is not changing.""Orsini added: ""Cycles happen, and so we've been in a bear market for about 13 months, and those (bear markets) were where the opportunities lie for long-term investors.""Biggest GainersThere are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.Biggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorCosmosATOM−5.3%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL−4.9%Smart Contract PlatformGalaGALA−4.8%EntertainmentInsightsHow will FTX Contagion Affect Sino Global Capital?By Sam ReynoldsConnections between Sino Global Capital’s Liquid Value Fund, its first fund for outside investment, and Sam Bankman-Fried as well as Alameda Research, might mean the venture capital fund is mentioned in FTX’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings, according to a Hong Kong lawyer who specializes in asset tracing.According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Sino Global’s Liquid Value counts Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda as general partners and co-owners of the fund.In a prior comment to The Block, Matthew Graham, Sino Global’s founder, who has been historically closely aligned with SBF and FTX, said that a “substantial” portion of the Liquid Value fund’s $200 million had been committed by FTX and other partners.According to a recent report by the Financial Times, which detailed all of Alameda’s investments, the Bankman-Fried-affiliated fund put $60 million into Sino Global’s Liquid Value Fund. An unknown amount was then contributed by SBF himself.These events will complicate FTX and Alameda’s process in their bankruptcy hearings, says Stephen Chan, a partner at Hong Kong-based law firm Ince.“If they are in a partnership, all partners share in the upside and the downside,” Chan said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The other partners may incur liability for the actions of SBF and Alameda.”A material amount of Alameda’s balance sheet was made up of FTX’s FTT token, as CoinDesk previously reported, which it used for collateral on investments. If Alameda funded part, or all, of its contribution to Sino Global’s Liquid Value fund via FTT, then this pool of assets – and whatever they were invested in – would be a part of what’s available to creditors.If it turns out that SBF and his cohorts were committing fraud and some of SBF’s partners were in knowing receipt of proceeds of fraud, Chan explained, there would be a slightly different route under Hong Kong common law (the fund is domiciled there, and FTX/Alameda had a significant presence in the territory).“If SBF is a general partner, then the partnership may have liability,” Chan said.In instances of fraud, liquidators working on the FTX-Alameda case may look to recipients of proceeds of fraud to see whether civil recovery is possible.But all of this might be challenging, to say the least. Sino Global is heavily invested in Solana and its respective infrastructure.CoinGecko data shows that Solana has suffered a 93% loss during the last year, and in the weeks following FTX’s collapse nearly $700 million in locked-in value has been wiped out from Solana decentralized finance protocols.The token of Orca, a Solana-based decentralized exchange that is one of Sino Global’s leading portfolio companies, reached a high of $20 in October 2021; it is now worth just over 40 cents. Its total value locked went from $1.4 billion at its height to $43.15 million today, according to DeFiLlama.FTX’s FTT token is currently trading at $1.51, up 14% during the last two weeks, but down 95% on the month. Recently, its contract deployer has dumped the entirety of the locked FTT tokens into circulation, effectively flooding the market with what is already a token of questionable value.Important events8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC) Australia Trade Balance (MoM/Oct)8:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:00 UTC) European Central Bank's President Christine Lagarde Speech9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Initial Jobless ClaimsCoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Dips Under $17K; Sam Bankman-Fried Hires Attorney Mark Cohen: ReportFormer FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has hired high-profile defense attorney Mark Cohen, the same attorney who represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex-trafficking trial, according to Reuters.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Gensler, who declined to specifically talk about failed crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said in an interview on Yahoo! Finance that the SEC has the basic disclosure and governance requirements in place to hold digital-assets firms accountable.The SEC chief also didn’t directly address questions about whether his agency would push out tailored crypto rules next year, but he insisted that it doesn’t need any. “The rules are there,” he said. “The law firms know how to advise their clients to comply.”FTX’s crash showed the dangers of running a global platform without walls between customer funds and investment operations, Gensler said. Crypto firms can’t do everything. “Your field will not last long outside of public policy norms,” he said.The court case over whether Ripple’s XRP is a security has been seen as the major lingering question holding the agency back, but Gensler said Wednesday that a federal judge’s decision last month determining that crypto startup LBRY violated securities laws by selling its native LBC tokens was a “very big win” for the SEC’s legal campaign.So far, the SEC hasn’t directly gone after U.S. exchange Coinbase (COIN) for listing what the agency believes are securities without registering as a national securities exchange. Still, the SEC has – in another recent enforcement action – listed several tokens it considers unregistered securities that were traded on the company’s platform.Token Roundup(CoinDesk Research)Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,800, down about a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has held comfortably above $17,000 for much of the past nine days, despite ongoing investor jitters about contagion linked to the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly signs since late last week that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to maintain its hawkish course on interest rate hikes through 2023.Story continuesSushiSwap (SUSHI): The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is facing a significant deficit in its treasury that threatens its long-term operational viability, according to a governance proposal from project developers. After reviewing expenditures, the project's annual runway requirement was reduced from $9 million to $5 million, but the treasury still provides for only about 18 months of runway, developers said.Axie Infinity (AXS): The native token of the blockchain-based play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, has come out of oblivion this week with a double-digit price rally. Yet, leverage traders appear skeptical if AXS' turnaround from 17-month lows would be longlasting. That's because while open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active standard futures and perpetual futures contracts tied to AXS, has increased to a three-month high of $129.70 million, funding rates remain negative, according to data source Coinglass.Latest PricesCoinDesk Market Index (CMI)850.81 −11.4 ▼ 1.3%  Bitcoin (BTC)$16,814 −174.0 ▼ 1.0%  Ethereum (ETH)$1,230 −25.5 ▼ 2.0%  S&amp;P 500 daily close3,933.92 −7.3 ▼ 0.2%  Gold$1,799 +29.4 ▲ 1.7%  Treasury Yield 10 Years3.41% ▼ 0.1  BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price.

If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter. Increased short-term rates and slower economic growth lead to lower demand and prices for physical and digital assets.10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Constant Maturity (Fred Database)Read the full technical take here.Other NewsCoinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brian Armstong said the company’s revenue will be about half what it was last year as the crypto exchange struggles amid stark price drops in cryptocurrencies and continuing ripple effects from multiple bankruptcies this year, including the recent collapse of rival exchange FTX. Armstrong noted in an interview with Bloomberg’s David Rubenstein that Coinbase had done about $7 billion in revenue ($7.8 billion, according to FactSet) and $4 billion in positive EBITDA. “It's looking, you know, about roughly half that or less,” Armstrong said.Genesis interim CEO Derar Islim wrote in a letter to customers Wednesday that resolution of his company’s lending unit’s withdrawal freeze is likely to be a matter of “weeks” rather than days. The lending arm of Genesis in November was forced to suspend redemptions following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. This morning’s note from Islim said Genesis is committed to being as “transparent as possible” with customers and that it is working in consultation with highly experienced advisers and in close collaboration with its owner, Digital Currency Group.

An inversion in the U.S. yield curve was also perceived by several market participants as an indicator of an impending recession.But while gold has largely lost its safe haven status this year, speculation that the dollar has peaked this year weighed on the greenback drove recent flows into the yellow metal.Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,783.11 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,795.15 an ounce by 20:17 ET (01:17 GMT). Both instruments rallied nearly 1% each on Wednesday, amid growing concerns over a U.S. recession.Focus this week is on U.S. producer inflation data for November, due on Friday, to gauge the path of price pressures in the country.While inflation eased in October, it still remained well above the Federal Reserve’s target range. Signs of strength in consumer spending and the jobs market also raised concerns over inflation remaining stickier than expected in the coming months.Such a scenario is likely to invite more hawkish moves by the Fed. While the central bank is expected to hike rates by a smaller margin next week, it has warned that U.S. rates could peak at higher-than-expected levels in the face of stubborn inflation.Rising U.S. interest rates weighed heavily on gold prices this year, and a hawkish outlook from the Fed is likely to further dent the yellow metal.Among industrial metals, copper prices were flat on Thursday after two straight days of gains, amid optimism over an economic reopening in China.Copper futures steadied around $3.8448 a pound after rising nearly 1% in the past two sessions.China announced the further relaxation of anti-COVID curbs this week, driving up hopes of an eventual economic recovery in the world’s largest copper importer.Story continuesBut the country is still struggling with record-high daily increases in infections. Slowing economic growth in the rest of the world could also potentially weigh on copper demand in the near-term, keeping prices subdued.Related ArticlesGold hovers below $1,800, recession fears spur some safe haven demandPutin acknowledges Russia's war in Ukraine could be a long oneOil prices steady after hitting 2022 lows]"

We are looking to bring people with the capability to advise the board on investment decisions,"" he told reporters after the meeting, adding that the objective is to accelerate plans in the area.Demand for metals like nickel and lithium is seen growing sharply in coming years due to expected production growth of electric vehicles (EV).

You will be better off in the long term,” Berkery said.Andra Nicolau, head of business development for Origin Protocol concurred, pointing out the contrast between 2022 and 2021 in terms of investor attitudes toward taking chances on blockchain projects.See also: EXCLUSIVE: Anthony Scaramucci Calls Out Chamath Palihapitiya On FTX Warning Signs, 'We Can Pretend Otherwise, But None Of Us Really Knew'“Last year we raised about $300 million. At some point, you just sit back and watch the money coming in. This year is completely different. Investors are being incredibly selective and careful in their due diligence,” Nicolau said.Building Organic TractionThe panel, which included Matt Higgins, co-founder &amp; CEO of RSE Ventures, and Greg Carson, head of Corporate Development and Ventures for XBTO Group, was unanimous in the belief that projects should be “building organic traction, acquiring users; then when the product is working go and raise capital” - as Nicolau stated.Carson pointed out that fundraising tends to go in four-to-six-month cycles and it’s something that projects should revisit regularly as they develop their offerings and the market begins to change.Partnerships with traditional finance should also be a strategic consideration.See also: EXCLUSIVE: SBF - 'Idiot Or Fraudster?'

150,bd461a4a-ef4d-3d9d-af55-29f76ff48f44,QCOM,2022-12-08,QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM) shareholders have earned a 16% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-nasdaq-qcom-shareholders-earned-140052825.html,1670421652,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) share price is up 85% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 42% (ignoring dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, QUALCOMM achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 48% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 13% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 10.34 also suggests market apprehension.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that QUALCOMM has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling QUALCOMM stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for QUALCOMM the TSR over the last 5 years was 112%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 19% in the twelve months, QUALCOMM shareholders did even worse, losing 33% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  QUALCOMM is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those can't be ignored...For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Notably, the CV-22 is a variant of the V-22 family of jets and helps conduct long-range infiltration, exfiltration and resupply missions for special operations forces.Considering these features of the aforementioned family of tiltrotors and the growing demand for military aircraft, V-22 and its variants enjoy decent demand across the globe.

The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about a global economic recovery.Year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have plunged 7.6%, 29.6% and 17.3%, respectively. The global economy has been going through a massive slowdown due to the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.Given the current highly volatile market environment and the growing fears of an incoming recession, investors are panicking about investing in the market. Does it mean that there are no sectors to invest in amid this market volatility?We believe that investing in defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities and Health Care amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and the highly volatile market scenario might provide stability to one’s portfolio and fetch some returns as well.These sectors comprise companies providing necessary products and services of daily use. Defensive sector stocks like Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM, The Hershey Company HSY, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH and Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Founded in 1902, this Illinois-based company is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.Archer Daniels has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver. The company expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 15%-20% in 2022.At present, ADM has a Zacks Rank of 1 and a Growth Score of A.

163,137aeb12-ed6e-3778-8ac4-ed58e6d20633,ROK,2022-12-08,Rockwell Automation's (NYSE:ROK) earnings growth rate lags the 7.9% CAGR delivered to shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automations-nyse-rok-earnings-125344611.html,1670504024,STORY,['ROK'],"[If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) share price is up 33% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 27% in that time.While the stock has fallen 3.6% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Rockwell Automation managed to grow its earnings per share at 4.7% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 6% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Rockwell Automation's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Rockwell Automation's TSR for the last 5 years was 47%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Rockwell Automation shareholders are down 26% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 20%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 8% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Rockwell Automation .Rockwell Automation is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

Over the 1-year duration of the project, this pathway is estimated to avoid 120,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions when compared to the national average methane emissions for the production, gathering and transmission segments.Context Labs is leveraging its DaaS™ platform to integrate data from multiple sources across Coterra’s and Williams’ operations, including ground-based optical gas imaging cameras, flyovers, satellite monitoring and internal operational systems. This data is aggregated and reconciled using a block-chain secured carbon accounting ledger to provide an end-to-end path-specific methane intensity certification from production through gathering and transmission. The environmental attributes associated with the delivery of next gen natural gas will be registered, tracked and retired through Context Lab’s CLEAR Path™ platform. ""We are thrilled to be working with Williams and its supply chain ecosystem partners to produce the energy industry’s premier end-to-end next generation natural gas certification transactions,"" said Dan Harple, Founder and CEO of Context Labs.The program represents the first full value chain methane emissions certification program that will meet or exceed the Quantification, Measurement, Reporting and Verification (QMRV) measurement standards prescribed by the Oil &amp; Gas Methane Partnership, a multi-stakeholder partnership developed by the United Nations, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.

The plane with the iconic bulge above the cockpit has carried movies stars and presidents, and it still serves as Air Force One. It has even carried a space shuttle.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureMost importantly, the 747 was the workhorse that flew regular people to airline hubs across the world as airlines grew and air travel become more accessible. Each landing poured hundreds of passengers into major airports, to be shuttled by smaller planes to final destinations.But that all changed about 20 years ago, when Boeing made a bet that people didn’t really want to travel that way.A new way to travel by air was soon made obsoleteWith the 747, Boeing invented the wide-body, two-aisle airplane. When the model first went into service in 1969, connecting flights were part of the excitement and novelty of flying. These days, the prospect of a connection conjures images of Planes Trains and Automobiles: One storm in Chicago can wipe out holiday gatherings across the country.As airplane technology improved, air travel was transformed. Boeing developed smaller, fuel efficient airplanes that could fly farther. By the 21st century, it became the norm for passengers to skip over hubs for convenient, nonstop flights.In 2002, Boeing quoted Randy Baseler, then the head of marketing for commercial airplanes, on the shift to smaller aircraft.“The thinking behind Boeing’s theory of market fragmentation is this: the current hub-and-spoke system will break into smaller fragments—routes that are point-to-point rather than point-hub-point … If you want to go to Beijing, you go directly to Beijing without passing through Tokyo. If passengers have a choice, it’s pretty obvious that’s what they’d want.”Story continuesOver time, the 747 behemoth, already facing competition against newer, more fuel efficient wide-body models like the 777, became less useful to airlines. Airlines began transitioning to narrow-body aircrafts like the 737. Today, the 747 is the least fuel efficient wide-body plane in service.A 747 jet carries the space shuttle to an airport runwayCarrying the space shuttleThe shift to smaller planes has not been entirely smooth. Boeing’s transition to the 737 model has been closely scrutinized by regulators after the deadly Lion Air and Ethiopian Airline crashes in recent years.Airbus goes bigWhile Boeing was betting on smaller planes, its rival, Airbus, went big, developing the A380, which can hold as many as 853 passengers. Airbus halted production of the massive plane in 2021 as airlines grounded their aircraft amid the pandemic. Post-covid, many of those planes are returning to service.The 747 was certified in 1969. The first flight took off in 1970 from New York JFK to London Heathrow, two historic airport hubs. The operator was Pan Am, an airline that is now defunct. Boeing built 1,574 of the 747 model over the course of more than five decades.A black and white photo of passengers boarding the first BOAC 747 jumbo jet used for a commercial flightBack in the day: 1971Despite its waning popularity as a passenger plane, the 747 has served a purpose as a cargo jet in recent years, playing a critical role to a variety of logistics companies.

176,6c89e83a-d16b-3ade-80e8-4adcbc3c4920,SO,2022-12-08,Vogtle Unit 4 completes cold hydro testing,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vogtle-unit-4-completes-cold-201700870.html,1670444220,STORY,['SO'],"[ATLANTA, Dec. 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Georgia Power today announced the completion of cold hydro testing for Vogtle Unit 4 at the nuclear expansion project near Waynesboro, Ga. The completion of cold hydro testing is required to support the last major test remaining for Unit 4, hot functional testing, which is projected to commence by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Georgia Power logo. (PRNewsFoto/Georgia Power)""The team at the Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 site continues to make important progress as we move closer to bringing online the first new nuclear units to be built in the country in over 30 years. Completion of cold hydro testing on Unit 4 is another critical milestone along the path to get us there,"" said Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""These units are a long-term investment for our state and essential to building the future of energy for Georgia. For the next 60 to 80 years, they will help us continue to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers, serving generations of Georgians as clean, emission-free sources of energy.""Cold hydro testing on Unit 4 confirmed the reactor's coolant system functions as designed and verified the welds, joints, pipes and other components of the coolant system and associated high-pressure systems do not leak when under pressure. As part of the testing, the reactor coolant system was filled with water and pressurized above-normal operating conditions, then lowered to normal design pressure while comprehensive inspections were conducted to verify the systems meet design standards.Other recent milestones for Vogtle Unit 4 include:Closed vessel testing (CVT) – Completed in early November, this testing process verified that the pipes and valves in the Unit 4 reactor coolant system are installed as designed and helps ensure safety systems function properly. To carry out CVT on the plant's passive safety systems, workers installed the reactor vessel head as well as the lower and upper reactor internals and flow restrictors which will be used during hot functional testing to mimic flow through the reactor core.Rotation of turbine on turning gear – Also in November, the Unit 4 Turbine was rotated on its turning gear for the first time, demonstrating the turbine was assembled with quality and that integrated oil systems function as designed. The main turbine system consists of one high-pressure turbine and four low-pressure turbines. Rotating the turbines on the turning gear ties in all the oil systems and a significant number of supporting systems in the turbine island, which is a separate structure outside of the unit's nuclear containment building. Once operational, the turbine will rotate at 1,800 revolutions per minute, propelled by steam produced by the unit's two steam generators using heat transferred from the nuclear reactor.  The turbine blades turn the generator rotor to produce electricity.Story continuesFollowing the safe loading of nuclear fuel for Vogtle Unit 3 in October, teams at the site have continued to advance through various phases of start-up testing. Vogtle Unit 3 is projected to enter service in the first quarter of 2023.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, the two new units, which will be clean energy sources that produce zero air pollution, are expected to power more than 500,000 homes and businesses. Southern Nuclear will operate the new unit on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.About Georgia PowerGeorgia Power is the largest electric subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO), America's premier energy company. Value, Reliability, Customer Service and Stewardship are the cornerstones of the company's promise to 2.7 million customers in all but four of Georgia's 159 counties.

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. That downside risk was realized by Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 43%. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 20%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 16% in the last three years.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. View our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unfortunately Skyworks Solutions reported an EPS drop of 13% for the last year. This reduction in EPS is not as bad as the 43% share price fall. This suggests the EPS fall has made some shareholders are more nervous about the business. The P/E ratio of 11.55 also points to the negative market sentiment.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Skyworks Solutions' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Skyworks Solutions shareholders are down 41% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 20%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.9% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Skyworks Solutions has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $30.2 million, the contract is expected to get completed by December 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide technical publications, logistics support analysis and logistics product data resulting from production engineering changes, diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages to support CH-53K aircraft production and fielding.The majority of work related to this deal will be carried out in Stratford, CT.Benefits of the ContractCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and the integration of new tactical and logistical features. CH-53K aircraft is designed to be intelligent, reliable, low maintenance and survivable in the most austere and remote forward operating bases and this has been providing ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for the same in recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters.ProspectsThe United States is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide and continues to strengthen its military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Boeing BA and Textron TXT, which also have expertise in manufacturing military aircraft.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. It also enables warfighters to accomplish missions under any conditions.NOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.9%.

Always making this industry tough as well are changing trends and styles that apparel companies must constantly stay on top of. One apparel company that has been hit particularly hard is VF Corp. (NYSE:VFC).The company produces clothing and shoes in three segments: Outdoor, Active and Work. The list of products include outdoor apparel, merino wool products, lifestyle and casual apparel. Footwear encompasses both youth culture brands and work-related options. The North Face, Timberland, Smartwool, Icebreaker, Altra, Vans, Supreme, Kipling, Napapijri, Eastpak, JanSport and Dickies are some of its top brands.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with VFC. Click here to check it out. VFC 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VFCPeter Lynch Chart of VFCVF was historically known for its Lee and Wrangler blue jeans, which date back a century, but those brands were spun off into a company called Kontoor Brands Inc. (NYSE:KTB) in 2019.Founded in 1899 and headquartered in Denver, the company currently has a market capitalization of $11.4 billion and is expected to generate over $11 billion in revenue this year.Financial reviewOn Oct. 26, the company reported second-quarter results for the period ending Oct. 1, which were mostly below expectations and somewhat challenging. Revenue declined 4%, but increased 2% on a constant currency basis. The adjusted gross margin declined 240 basis points to 51.5%, while the adjusted operating margin declined 440 basis points to 12.3%. The decline in margins was attributed to increased promotional activity, higher discounts and inflationary input costs.The company has four power brands, which are the key drivers of its financial results. Sales for Vans declined 6% on a constant currency basis, while The North Face increased 21%, Timberland increased 7% and Dickies declined 14%.Story continuesThe balance sheet shows $553 million in cash and $6 billion in total debt. With $1.3 billion in Ebitda expected in 2023, the companys leverage ratio is above average at 4.2. Inventories increased substantially and were up 88% compared with the prior-year period, which was partially driven by an increase of in-transit inventory of approximately $510 million. Accounts payable increased 91%, which was also largely driven by the increase of in-transit inventory.ValuationThe company also lowered its guidance for the fourth time since May 2022, stating incremental challenges from weaker domestic consumer demand, higher promotions, wholesale order cancellations, inflation and other restrictions in international markets. The company expects revenue to increase in the 5% to 6% range on a constant currency basis, but a decrease in margins compared to prior guidance. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.50 compared to $3.18 last year and prior guidance of $2.60 to $2.70. Operating cash flow is expected to be $900 million, with capital expenditures of $230 million.Consensus analyst earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending March 2023 are approximately $2.14, which puts VF's stock trading at 13 times earnings. The enterprise value/Ebitda ratio is slightly higher than average at 12 times because of the high debt load.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator creates a value close to current price levels when using a long-term growth rate of 6% and an earnings per share starting point of $2.14. However, the company is earning below its potential due to the cost pressures and supply chain issues. During a normalized earnings environment, the DCF value should be much higher.The most recent declared dividend is $2.04 on an annualized basis, which creates a dividend yield of almost 7%. With a payout of close to 80%, many analysts are expecting dividend cuts in 2023. So do not expect that 7% yield to be sustainable over time.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased VF stock recently include Richard Pzena (Trades, Portfolio) and Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio). Jeremy Grantham (Trades, Portfolio) reduced his holding recently, while Catherine Wood (Trades, Portfolio) sold out of the stock.SummaryVF Corp is currently facing some material headwinds. These include a turnaround in the Vans product line, which is facing challenges from softer traffic in the Americas and continued Covid-19 impacts in China. Also, the elevated inventory levels are and will continue to cause a higher level of markdowns and promotions, which will negatively affect margins. There also appears to be a weakening of consumer sentiment in both North America and Europe. Management noted that major retailers are cutting orders so they can managed their own inventory problems.Chairman, President and CEO Steve Rendle summarized the environment by stating, ""VFs balanced performance in Q2 demonstrates the resiliency of our brand portfolio against a more disrupted global marketplace. Our purpose-built portfolio of iconic, deeply-loved brands continues to benefit from tailwinds in the outdoor, active, streetwear and workwear spaces while we also actively address the near-term challenges at Vans, the ongoing COVID-related disruption in China, and the broader macro-economic and geopolitical headwinds, which have created tremendous uncertainty for all businesses and consumers.Although VF's stock has decreased 62% in the past 52 weeks, there may be more downside ahead if these headwinds do not start to recede in the near term.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the free market as it pertains to ethical conduct in the US and go directly to 5 Most Ethical Companies in the US. Young people are becoming increasingly awake to the social, historical, climate and financial injustices and choose to give business to, and invest in companies that share their values. Many corporations have responded positively to the development. “Ethical” CapitalismTo give you a quantitative perspective on the corporate ethical turn, Yale School of Management has compiled a list of 138 corporations with extended women’s benefits, not offered by other corporations. Out of these, nearly a third are tech corporations. The most prominent ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In terms of doing business in Russia, over a 1,000 corporations (majority of them American) have left the country after it invaded the neighboring Ukraine. Evidence indicates that the equity market’s reward to the companies for the action far outweighs the potential loss from leaving Russia. On the other hand, companies that are still engaged in business with Russia are being punished by investors. At the sustainability front, many companies have adopted “planet friendly” policies to lower the burden on Earth’s ecosystem and climate. However, most of the corporate sector has been called out several times for “greenwashing” and not actually doing enough. Regardless, the companies we’ve discussed are doing their part for sustainability as well as social and financial justice. ESG’s Impact on a Company’s Financial PerformanceESG refers to the Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance. It's a set of standards that impact-investors look at when investing based on values. Stern School of Business carried out a meta-analysis of a 1,000 studies on ESG, done between the period of 2015-2020, and concluded that ESG and corporate financial performance had a statistically significant positive correlation for 58% of the studies. The analysis also discovered that corporate investments in sustainability were actually advantageous in the long-term while having no impact on financial performance in the short-term.Story continuesNow that we have the perspective on the ethical free market, let’s move on to the list of 22 most ethical companies in the US. 22 Most Ethical Companies in the USPhoto by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 22 most ethical companies in the US, we’ve ranked them based on how many times they’ve been hailed as honorees for being ethical up until 2022 by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in assessing ethical businesses.We’ve also mentioned each company’s ESG-risk scores from Sustainalytics, a premier ESG grader.

Richard Carucci, a director on the Board since 2009, will serve as Interim Chairman.VF also reduced its FY23 outlook largely to reflect the impact of weaker-than-anticipated consumer demand across its categories, primarily in North America.Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares of VFC and lowered the price target from $45 to $36.The analyst noted Dorer's experience includes large, global consumer packaged goods companies. Most recently, he served as the CEO of Clorox Co (NYSE: CLX) from 2015 to 2020.The analyst specified that VF Corp has again lowered its FY23 outlook, given the weaker consumer demand.The more conservative outlook, the analyst said, reflects weaker consumer demand, with some impact from inflationary pressures in Europe and COVID-19 disruptions in China.The third downward guidance revision for FY23 is disappointing despite a challenging macro environment as the revision has been made in a short interval, added the analyst.Despite the majority of VFC's other brands posting decent growth to-date in FY23, the Vans brand has been the stock's primary driver over the past several years, and is now the basis of VF's shares' underperformance, in the analyst's view.In this scenario, the analyst believes a fresh perspective from a new business leader could prove valuable moving forward.Near-term macro uncertainties and a flagging Vans business remain headwinds, clouding near-term visibility with the Vans reset likely to take some time.Meanwhile, the analyst expects the company's strong brand portfolio with a favorable mix across categories (active, outdoor, work and street) can drive broad-based growth across channels and geographies longer-term.Price Action: VFC shares are trading lower by 1.47% at $29.07 on the last check Tuesday.Story continuesLatest Ratings for VFCDateFirmActionFromToJan 2022Truist SecuritiesMaintainsHoldJan 2022Deutsche BankMaintainsBuyJan 2022BarclaysMaintainsEqual-WeightView More Analyst Ratings for VFCView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaRocket Lab USA Is Ready For Liftoff, Morgan Stanley SaysFunko's Management Changes Increase This Analyst's Confidence About Solving Distribution IssuesDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Corp (VFC) Slips on Fiscal 2023 View Cut, CEO Departure",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-corp-vfc-slips-124012456.html,1670330412,STORY,"['VFC', 'PVH']","[V.F. Corporation VFC fell 11.17% on Dec 5, 2022 on management’s commentary on lowered expectations for fiscal 2023. Yesterday, the company trimmed its outlook for fiscal 2023, driven by lower-than-expected consumer demand across its business categories, mostly in North America. The reduced demand is likely to result in a heightened promotional environment and wholesale order cancellations to manage inventory levels.V.F. Corp also notes that the reduced consumer discretionary spending in Europe due to inflationary pressures and ongoing pandemic-related disturbances in China is expected to affect its performance in fiscal 2023. Concurrent with the slashed view, the company also announced the departure of its chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), Steve Rendle.V.F. Corp anticipates revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2023 to be slightly below the previous view, expecting a 3-4% increase in constant dollars (excluding foreign currency translations). VFC earlier predicted 5-6% revenue growth for fiscal 2023.Additionally, the company expects SG&amp;A deleverage in fiscal 2023 due to lower volumes. This, along with the promotional environment in North America, is likely to weigh on profitability.V.F. Corp anticipates fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be $2.00-$2.20 per share compared with the $3.18 reported in fiscal 2022 and $2.40-$2.50 expected earlier.However, the company stated that its long-term targets for fiscal 2027 and the capital allocation plan, as provided on Sep 28, 2022, remain intact. V.F. Corp has been on track with the execution of its strategy, vying to deliver on its long-term targets of strong shareholder value while improving near-term performance.V.F. Corp’s five-year growth plan (for fiscal 2023-2027) targets revenue growth in the mid-to-high-single digits on a five-year CAGR basis. The bottom line is predicted to rise at a five-year CAGR of high single to low double digits.The operating margin is envisioned to be 15% by fiscal 2027, driven by gross margin expansion and reduced SG&amp;A. Management also noted that it would return roughly $7 billion via dividends and share repurchases by fiscal 2027. Free cash flow is forecast at $5.5 billion.Following the departure of Steve Rendle, the company appointed Benno Dore as the interim president and CEO, effective immediately. Meanwhile, Richard Carucci has been selected to serve as the interim chairman of the board.Story continuesThings You Should KnowThe V.F. Corp stock has declined 61.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 30.9%. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock also compared unfavorably with the Consumer Discretionary and the S&amp;P 500’s declines of 33.1% and 14.6%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stock’s dismal run on the bourses can be attributed to the continued bleak performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year. VFC has been struggling with a tough operating environment, including pandemic-related disruptions in China, macro-economic and geopolitical headwinds and near-term challenges at Vans.V.F. Corp is also witnessing elevated SG&amp;A costs and elevated freight expenses related to COVID-19 headwinds. SG&amp;A expenses grew 7.8% to $1,251.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, following 11.5% in the fiscal first quarter.However, VFC’s brand portfolio and strength in the outdoor, active, streetwear and workwear units remain tailwinds. Also, growth in the EMEA and Americas regions acted as major growth drivers.Stocks to ConsiderHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Crocs CROX, PVH Corp PVH and lululemon athletica LULU.Crocs is one of the leading footwear brands, with its focus on comfort and style.

This expansion of Enterprise's Faith-Based Development Initiative (FBDI), which includes $1.5 million in grant funding from Wells Fargo and a $1.4 million grant from Trinity, will support up to 15 local faith-based organizations (FBOs) to create over 1,000 affordable homes in the New York City area over the next five years.New York City is part of a nationwide expansion of Enterprise's Faith-Based Development Initiative, supported by an $8.5 million donation from Wells Fargo announced earlier this year. Acquiring land presents a major barrier to affordable housing production. Meanwhile, in New York City and across the U.S., faith-based organizations own thousands of acres of unused or underutilized land, yet typically lack the experience necessary to transform property into affordable housing. These generous grants will enable Enterprise to provide deep and customized support to local FBOs in the development of property into affordable homes.""It is humbling and inspiring to see so many faith-based organizations, who have historically served their communities in a variety of meaningful ways, looking to transform their underused land into critical affordable housing for New York City residents,"" said Baaba Halm, vice president and New York market leader of Enterprise. ""We are immensely grateful to the Wells Fargo Foundation and Trinity Church Wall Street, whose generous funding will help us engage with numerous local faith-based organizations as they create much-needed affordable homes for New Yorkers and provide invaluable community leadership.""""It's been a privilege to support the nationwide expansion of Enterprise's Faith-Based Development Initiative, and we're looking forward to working with the faith community in New York City to help meet critical housing needs across the five boroughs,"" said Otis Rolley, president of the Wells Fargo Foundation and head of Philanthropy and Community Impact. ""As community anchors, houses of worship are at the center of so many lives, and this effort will give them the resources and tools to make an even bigger difference in their communities by creating quality and affordable places for families to live.""Story continues""We are excited to expand Trinity's partnership with Enterprise by supporting this crucial initiative that recognizes the agency of faith-based organizations in transforming their neighborhoods. These projects will have a vital social impact in activating underutilized land for affordable housing throughout New York City and will help build sustainable financial capacity for such faith-based organizations,"" said the Rev. James Clark III, managing director of Mission Real Estate Development at Trinity.There are over 5,000 properties owned by FBOs in the New York City region, with many of these organizations serving as longstanding pillars in their communities. In addition to offering sanctuary space, many FBOs provide broader services including daycare, food pantries, youth programming, and other offerings for local residents. In recent years, many FBOs have experienced compounding challenges, such as repairs needed for aging buildings, higher operating and maintenance costs, and constrained cash flows, all of which can jeopardize their future and threaten to uproot these institutions from their neighborhoods. At the same time, New York City has a severe shortage of affordable homes, with consistently high development costs and lack of available vacant land impeding housing development. Recognizing this need, many FBOs want to explore solutions to help create affordable housing while also preserving their legacy within the community.Over the next 18 months, Enterprise's FBDI aims to engage with 15 FBOs in the New York City area, to which the organization will provide technical development assistance and other support. Over the next five years, the FBDI will award grants and capital to participating FBOs, which will support their predevelopment needs by helping them make informed decisions, negotiating partnerships with developers, and equipping them for the development stage of construction. Enterprise will also provide FBOs with training led by Enterprise staff and local consultants; no-cost feasibility studies; technical assistance and resources to address project-specific challenges; connections to expert development partners; and peer-learning sessions for sharing reflections on best practices, challenges, and solutions.Importantly, Enterprise is prioritizing engaging with FBOs with Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) leadership, since BIPOC-led FBOs have historically had less access to financial resources and institutional knowledge to support their growth. As a result, FBDI aims to increase the local affordable housing supply while simultaneously addressing racial disparities that affect the housing developing industry.Enterprise's Faith-Based Development Initiative launched in 2006 in the Mid-Atlantic region, where it has helped faith-based organizations to create or preserve more than 1,500 affordable homes and one community-based health clinic, with more than a thousand additional affordable homes in the development pipeline. The work has led to the creation of a successful model and generated interest from faith-based organizations and cities to partner on a proven program. Wells Fargo has been a key partner in the national expansion of FBDI, paving the way for collaboration with houses of worship in Atlanta, Baltimore, Seattle, South Florida and New York City to create roughly 6,000 affordable homes.About Enterprise Community PartnersEnterprise is a national nonprofit that exists to make a good home possible for the millions of families without one. We support community development organizations on the ground, aggregate and invest capital for impact, advance housing policy at every level of government, and build and manage communities ourselves. Since 1982, we have invested $54 billion and created 873,000 homes across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico - all to make home and community places of pride, power and belonging.

The company's market worth decreased by US$16b over the past week after the stock price dropped 8.8%, although insiders were able to minimize their lossesAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Kleber Santos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$43.40. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Kleber Santos.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.06% of Wells Fargo shares, worth about US$97m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Wells Fargo Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Wells Fargo shares in the last quarter. Our analysis of Wells Fargo insider transactions leaves us cautious. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort.

(Susan Walsh / Associated Press)If you need evidence that Congress is dominated by its stupidest members, look no further than the apparent agreement in the House to lift the requirement that members of the military be vaccinated against COVID-19.Congressional sources say that rescinding the mandate, which Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin imposed in August 2021, is part of a compromise aimed at passing this year's $858-billion National Defense Authorization Act during the current lame-duck legislative session.The House is expected to vote on the act Thursday, with the Senate to follow. The Democratic capitulation to the GOP's demand to rescind the vaccine mandate is an inexcusable dereliction of Congress' duty to care for the health of military service members and the general public.We lost a million people to this virus...So this mandate has kept people healthy.Defense Secretary Lloyd AustinLifting the COVID vaccine mandate has been a Republican hobby horse since its inception. The GOP position reflects the consistent anti-science coloration of the party's policy stances, especially where anti-pandemic measures are concerned.Austin and President Biden have fought back against congressional efforts to rescind the mandate. As recently as Saturday, Austin told reporters that he wanted to keep the mandate in place.“We lost a million people to this virus,” Austin said. “A million people died in the United States of America. We lost hundreds in DOD [Department of Defense]. So this mandate has kept people healthy.”On the other side are Republicans infused with anti-vaccine myth-making.These include untrue claims that the vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer are not safe or effective and haven't been adequately tested — claims that have been consistently refuted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The caliber of the vaccine objections can be gleaned from the lawsuit brought in Colorado federal court by two former military officers in 2021.Story continuesThey based their objections on a passel of long-debunked anti-vaccine claims, including that the vaccines were ""experimental,"" that the Pfizer shot had never actually been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and that the shots were a ""deadly... genetic modification injection.""A federal judge in Denver dismissed the lawsuit in January, but the plaintiffs appealed. At a hearing last month, a panel of federal appellate judges displayed frank skepticism about their claims. The panel hasn't yet ruled.The partisan attacks on COVID vaccination have undoubtedly contributed to the increasing gap between Republican- and Democratic-leaning Americans in COVID death rates and vaccination rates.A recently published study from the Yale School of Medicine found that ""excess deaths during the pandemic were 76% higher among Republicans than Democrats"" in Ohio and Florida. The partisan discrepancy in death rates ""increased significantly after vaccines were introduced.""A survey published in November 2021 by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters made up 60% of the adult unvaccinated population, despite representing only 41% of adults; Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents accounted for only 17% of the unvaccinated.""Political partisanship is a stronger predictor of whether someone is vaccinated than any demographic factor,"" the survey reported.Republicans on Capitol Hill have tried to cast the COVID vaccine mandate as a drag on military readiness. In a Nov. 30 letter to Republican Senate leaders, 13 GOP senators led by right-winger Rand Paul of Kentucky noted that 3,400 troops had been discharged by April for refusing the vaccine.The mandate ""adversely affects our service members and our national security,"" they wrote. ""The United States simply cannot afford to discharge our brave men and women in uniform and lose the investments we have made into each and every one of them due to an inept bureaucratic policy.""What was ""inept"" about the mandate they didn't say.It should be obvious that refusing the vaccine ordered by senior Pentagon officials to maintain the health of the armed services would be a clear act of insubordination; allowing those actions to stand would undermine readiness far more than discharging the objectors.The Pentagon said in April that about 70% of the 3,400 troops separated from the service for vaccine refusal received general discharges, which would allow them to keep their veterans benefits and return to service if they received the vaccine.The Pentagon also said that there were ""no operational impacts across the force for readiness” resulting from the mandate. About 97% of active-duty troops and officers were vaccinated by mid-April.Austin, Biden and the Democrats in the House have stood firm against Republican demands that service members who refused the vaccine be reinstated.In a Dec. 4 appearance on Fox News, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield), said that rescinding the mandate was a nonnegotiable demand for the GOP's assent to the National Defense Authorization Act — ""otherwise, the bill will not move.""The Democrats should have called their bluff and upheld its own healthcare policy. Giving in to pressure to rescind the COVID vaccine mandate could even undermine the Pentagon's other vaccine mandates for service members, which include shots for polio, measles, hepatitis, flu and tetanus.Is it really plausible that the Republicans would have torpedoed the act over this issue? Defense spending is almost the only federal spending that the GOP favors; here's betting that the party wouldn't be comfortable with having the funding act's failure being hung around its neck.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

(PFE) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-pfizer-inc-140002072.html,1670421602,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned +5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share, indicating a change of +0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +46.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.85 indicates a change of -25% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $24.14 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $100.18 billion and $76.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.9% and -23.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $22.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $1.78 for the same period compares with $1.34 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.61%. The EPS surprise was +21.09%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) were down more than 4% and 6% respectively, while Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) fell 1%.Energy stocks were flat, shrugging off a more than 2% slump in crude following data showing mixed U.S. petroleum data as crude stockpiles fell more than expected, but gasoline inventories surged offsetting somewhat positive news about demand as China eases COVID restrictions.Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes Co (NASDAQ:BKR) fell about 2%, while Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) tumbled nearly 3%.On the earnings front, investors digested mixed quarterly results.Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) reported better-than-expected fourth quarter results even as the housing market was hurt by higher mortgage rates.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ:PYPL) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for PayPal Holdings, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$3.8b ÷ (US$76b - US$43b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, PayPal Holdings has an ROCE of 12%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 12%. See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PayPal Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From PayPal Holdings' ROCE Trend?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has employed 95% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 12%. Since 12% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesOn a side note, PayPal Holdings' current liabilities are still rather high at 57% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.The Bottom LineThe main thing to remember is that PayPal Holdings has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. However, over the last five years, the stock hasn't provided much growth to shareholders in the way of total returns. That's why we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the fundamentals are appealing.PayPal Holdings does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for PayPal Holdings  that you might be interested in.While PayPal Holdings isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World. If there is one industry that often sounds as if it is in the realm of science fiction, it is nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the use of materials science industrially involving matter whose dimensions range between one nanometer to 100 nanometers. For reference, a single strand of a human hair ranges anywhere between 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers, so nanotechnology, by definition, involves manipulating matter to sizes that are up to 100,000 times smaller than a hair on your head.Owing to the advantages offered by this unique manipulation, nanotechnology is adopted in a variety of different industries. These include construction, healthcare, and energy. In the construction industry, these technologies are used to create new materials that are durable and provide lucrative benefits such as water resistance, corrosion protection, and even self cleaning. Another widely popular application is the semiconductor industry, which has successfully created transistors that are now as small as 3 nanometers. Healthcare is another segment that benefits from nanotechnology, as nanotubes, owing to their small size, are effective fighters against cancer cells. These treatments involve injecting the nanotubes in the vicinity of cancer cells, and once they are bombarded with lasers, they generate heat that ends up killing the cancer cells. Nanoparticles are also used to bypass the blood-brain barrier due to their small size.Moving towards the industry itself, and growth estimates, the nanotechnology sector is projected to strongly grow due to its novelty and relatively nascent nature. For instance, a research report from Valuates Reports believes that the nanotechnology market was worth $1.76 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.4% between then and 2030 to be worth $33.63 billion by the end of the forecast period. The firm also believes that healthcare will be the largest segment, and nanodevices will be the most lucrative product category. Furthermore, it also outlines that Asia Pacific industry segment will grow at 40%, to outpace the overall industry trend, and the aerospace and defense sector will be the fastest growing user with a whopping 43.4% CAGR.Story continuesAnother report, this time from Atlantic Market Research, estimates a 13.6% CAGR for the nanotechnology market. According to the research firm, the industry will be worth $11.7 billion in 2023. Atlantic Market Research also outlines that electronic applications will hold a 27% market share of the nanotechnology market from 2021 to 2030. It adds that North America held a 21% market share of the nanomaterials market in 2020, and a 38% share of the broader nanotechnology market during the same year.Finally, Precedence Research has the largest estimate for the future value of the nanotechnology market. This research firm believes that the industry was worth $85 billion in 2021, and it will grow to a stunning $288 billion by 2030 through a 14.5% CAGR. Precedence Research also believes that as of May 2022, 20,000 nanotechnology researchers were working in the United States, and despite this, China will be the largest player in the future as well in addition to holding a 35% market share in 2021. Some key trends for the sector include semiconductors and electronics, while hurdles include the difficulties of scaling up the production of the products. These include the recent chip shortages that have created difficulties for both personal computing and automotive markets recently.Today's piece will focus on companies that work in the nanotechnology industry, and it ranges from those that provide the products and services to those that provide backend support. Top players include International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the Worldscience photo/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We took a look at several industries such as chip fabrication, healthcare, and industrials to determine which companies use nanotechnology.

211,490e83ca-a1a4-3780-a9a5-7d5eff0fcc2a,IBM,2022-12-08,Companies Must Harness Data To Meet Sustainability Commitments,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-must-harness-data-meet-151000205.html,1670425800,STORY,['IBM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 7, 2022 / The time for declaring sustainability ambition is behind us; the time for action is now. And a key to helping turn lofty goals into meaningful change is clear: it's about data.At the United Nation's COP27 climate change conference, I joined many of the top sustainability minds in government, academia, industry and more to discuss the pathways and barriers to realizing a more sustainable future. From these conversations, I remain convinced that accelerating progress in this space hinges on organizations ability to harness insights from the mountain of sustainability data that exists today - and to embed it more deeply within core operations to drive action.A major objective outlined at COP27 is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations to stem climate change. But for businesses, institutions and government entities to connect emissions targets to everyday operations, they need to be able to measure what they're doing and adjust their approach intelligently. They need empirical insights into their current state, and what they're progressing toward.Without data-and technologies to interpret that data at scale-sustainability is not as visible and it's not actionable. Still, many leading entities lack the connections and workflow to operationalize their data.The business leaders I speak with recognize both the need to possess meaningful environmental, social and governance (ESG) data, but also the potential challenges with acquiring that data and deriving business benefits from it. After all, ""climate-related data"" can be associated with a range of activities from your cafeteria operations to business travel, energy consumption, asset maintenance, IT and facilities infrastructure operations. For even moderately large enterprises, that data could span departments, purviews, offices, countries and even continents. The teams that could ultimately be tasked with compiling this information are now faced with a very reasonable concern: ""That is a lot of data we're going to have to figure out how to gather and make sense of.""Story continuesIn this common scenario, the challenge is not tied to a lack of data or technology to analyze it, but rather the ability to integrate and contextualize it. To effectively drive sustainability action, organizations need to streamline data collection, verify and connect data streams across multiple distinct systems. With such a foundation established, organizations can then be better equipped to embed sustainability decision making in daily operations.But what does this look like in practice?Connecting data to help make operations more sustainableTechnologies available today can help us gather and operationalize our climate and sustainability related data, an effort that not only helps organizations run more efficient, sustainable and resilient businesses, but also helps the planet. Improvements underpinned by meaningful data could range from extending the life of physical assets like equipment to creating more efficient and resilient supply chains, automating processes to reduce waste, managing the impact of climate change on business operations and creating more efficient data centers.As one example, AI and IoT technologies can help gather and analyze the data needed to modernize and digitize manufacturing operations. It should come as no surprise that most 20th and 21st century factories were not initially designed to accommodate the need to gather vast arrays of climate and sustainability-related data. In some cases, the data is - quite literally - slipping through the cracks. Take for example, HFCs, a class of commonly used refrigerants, which are much more potent than carbon dioxide. Yet, worldwide an estimated 50% of refrigerants are leaked into the atmosphere, largely due to poorly maintained assets and infrastructure. Companies that take advantage of sensors, analytics and AI to monitor their assets can gather data about leaks, and act more effectively to prevent them.Beyond leaks, leveraging data and AI for predictive maintenance can have wide-ranging effects on improving environmental impact, from helping run equipment more efficiently, to extending the life of assets in the first place - helping to reduce strain on resources, the planet and on your business.Another major opportunity is looking at supply chains. Due to inventory fluctuation, supply constraints and backlogs, and lack of visibility into where goods are located in a given moment - supply chains can be a source of significant waste, both in terms of emissions but also wasted products and idle inventory, defects and spoilage. AI models designed to analyze your supply chain can provide end-to-end visibility, near-real-time alerts and help organizations automate processes to be self-correcting, allowing organizations to work toward building a more sustainable and efficient supply chain.New technology can also help us gather and take advantage of data that wasn't previously attainable. Computer vision can comb satellite data for flaws in vulnerable infrastructure like levees or vegetation surrounding power lines that pose power outage and wild-fire risks, data that would have been too expensive or dispersed for humans to go and collect themselves. AI can also help do the heavy lifting of analyzing and interpreting climate data, surfacing insights and patterns that might have been misseCOP27 reinforced the urgency of advancements across all sectors if we hope to avert and mitigate the greatest effects of climate change on our environment, communities and economies. The enthusiasm of world leaders in government and business to make a difference is unmistakable, but success depends on the degree to which we turn ambition to action, including capitalizing on data and turning it to our advantage.Today's challenges may require substantial investment in new technologies and processes to help make organizations more resilient and sustainable. But for any of these investments to bear fruit, they need to be grounded in the reality of what's happening on the ground, and what needs to get done.In other words, they need to be grounded in the right data.Learn about IBM's sustainability solutionsIBM, Wednesday, December 7, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/730683/Companies-Must-Harness-Data-To-Meet-Sustainability-Commitments]"

This mega-scale renewable power to hydrogen project includes approximately 1.4 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar power generation, along with electrolyzer capacity capable of producing over 200 metric tons per day (MT/D) of green hydrogen, making it the largest green hydrogen facility in the United States.The new facility will be, by far, the largest green hydrogen facility in the U.S. to use wind and sun as energy sources.The facility, which is targeted to begin commercial operations in 2027, will serve growing demand for zero-carbon intensity fuels for the mobility market as well as other industrial markets. It will yield a totally clean source of energy on a massive scale, and, if all the green hydrogen were used in the heavy-duty truck market, it would eliminate more than 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually when compared to diesel use in heavy-duty trucks. Over the project lifetime, it is expected to avoid more than 50 million metric tons of CO2, the equivalent of avoiding emissions from nearly five billion gallons of diesel fuel.Air Products and AESi will jointly and equally own the renewable energy and electrolyzer assets, with Air Products serving as the exclusive off-taker and marketer of the green hydrogen under a 30-year contract.The project would create more than 1,300 construction and 115 permanent operations jobs, as well as about 200 transportation and distribution jobs. It is also expected to generate approximately $500 million in tax benefits to the state over the course of the project's lifetime, while extending Texas' energy leadership.Story continues""We are very pleased to announce this exciting joint venture with AES, which is one of the leading renewable energy companies in America.

The Services PMI registered a 56.5 reading in November, indicating an accelerated growth from October’s reading of 54.4. The latest labor market data further showed that payrolls rose by 263,000 in November compared to broad-based expectations of a 200,000 increase. In addition, average hourly earnings improved 0.6% compared with the prior month and 5.1% year over year, as the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.All these economic indicators signified that the overall economy was comparatively better placed for the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against inflation, putting the brakes on a short-term rally witnessed earlier. The markets widely expect that the central bank will likely raise interest rates by a 0.5 percentage point after four successive 75 basis point increases. This, in turn, could put the terminal rate in excess of 5% from its current target range of 3.75-4%.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Ryder System, Inc. R, AGNC Investment Corp. AGNC, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI and The AES Corporation AES are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen:PepsiCo: Headquartered in Purchase, NY, PepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies.

These charters aren't located at the dealerships themselves, but areas where the dealer, working with local authorities, determines what's the most useful spot for these 40,000 chargers.

And the automaker has earmarked 750 million bucks for that program right now.DAVE BRIGGS: And it's interesting now, just to go into that, what you mean by level two, from what I understand, that means it takes hours to charge an EV all the way up, as opposed to the top level, which can charge it in 30 minutes. So I'm thinking to myself, where do you put these if someone has a couple of hours to then charge their EV?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: They're talking about, like--DAVE BRIGGS: How significant is that?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Because DC chargers, those fast ones, are really expensive. So the next level below it, level two, put them at a coffee shop, a library, a government building, and people have business to do there. Park the car, charger's there.

You can skip our detailed analysis on dividend investment and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Low-Risk Dividend Stocks to Invest In. The stock market has been rocky throughout this year, making investors anxious about the outlook of the financial situation. The S&amp;P 500 is down 17.83% year-to-date through December 7, and analysts are predicting more volatility in the upcoming months, possibly leading to a recession. In these times, investors tend to minimize risks of potential losses by prioritizing low-risk investments.Dividend investment is considered a safe option in the current economic landscape as these securities have historically outperformed the broader market with less volatility. According to a report by Fidelity, high-dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during the last two bear markets. The report also mentioned that dividends have accounted for nearly half of the total returns of the S&amp;P 500 over the past 30 years.This year’s returns have also exhibited the strong performance of dividend stocks over other asset classes. The Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index is down by just 0.95% year-to-date, which is very mild considering the broader market’s returns. Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, spoke to Barron’s in December about the overall performance of dividend stocks. He said that during periods of slow economic growth, investors load up on dividend stocks because of their defensive qualities. He further mentioned that dividend strategies are expected to outperform in 2023 as well, with high dividend growth companies stealing the limelight. Senyek named the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index one of his favorite plays, as the companies in the index are mainly known for their consistent dividend growth.Some dividend stocks that are popular amongst investors this year include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance.

The central bank is expected to keep raising interest rates until inflation comes down reasonably. This has made investors wary as higher rates will lead to a recession in the next six-nine months.The pessimistic investor sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. At this stage, one way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like United Therapeutics Corp., StoneCo Ltd., Reinsurance Group of America, Inc. and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. are worth considering.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding into what is happening in a particular company.

With passenger revenues dwindling, airlines incurred huge losses to the tune of $137.7 billion and $42 billion, in 2020 and 2021, respectively.Airlines are now expected to incur a much narrower loss of $6.9 billion in the current year (earlier estimate was a loss of $9.7 billion) with an improvement in air-travel demand. Cargo revenues have also been impressive (expected to be $201.4 billion, which is way greater than the 2021 actual of $100.8 billion). High fuel costs have, however, hurt the current-year projection.The scenario with respect to air-travel demand is expected to improve further in 2023. As a result, airlines are expected to return to profitability next year. Per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), net profits for airlines across the globe are likely to be $4.7 billion in 2023. The top line next year is anticipated to be $779 billion compared with the current-year estimate of $727 billion.With people again taking to the skies, the greatest driver behind the top-line improvement is passenger revenues. Per IATA, passenger revenues for the next year are anticipated to be $522 billion (85.5% of 2019 [pre-coronavirus] levels). The 2023 projection is higher than the current-year estimate of $438 billion, despite economic uncertainties, with global GDP growth expected to slow down to 1.3% from 2.9% in 2022. Cargo revenues in 2023 are expected to be $149.4 billion, which is lower than the current-year projection but still $48.6 billion higher than 2019 actuals.Even though total costs next year are projected to be 5.3% higher than the current-year projection due to high labor and infrastructure costs apart from capacity shortages, oil price is likely to be lower. Per IATA, Brent crude is likely to come in at $92.3/barrel (down from an average of $103.2/barrel in 2022). Jet kerosene is expected to cost $111.9/barrel on an average, compared with $138.8 per barrel expected this year. Total fuel bill next year is expected to be $229 billion.Story continuesOn a region-wise basis, North American carriers that include the likes of Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL are expected to reap profits of $11.4 billion next year, higher than the current-year expectation of $9.9 billion. Reflecting the improved air-travel demand scenario, passenger demand next year is likely to grow 6.4%, higher than the anticipated capacity growth of 5.5%.United Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Delta and American Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To highlight the improving air-travel demand scenario, let’s recap the third-quarter 2022 results of the abovementioned North American carriers.Delta's earnings (excluding 42 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.51 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. Delta had reported earnings of 30 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then.Delta reported revenues of $13,975 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,157.2 million. Driven by the high air-travel demand, total revenues increased more than 52% on a year-over-year basis. The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the total operating revenue increase of 11% from third-quarter 2019 levels. The uptick in air-travel demand in the United States can be gauged from the fact that 71.1% of third-quarter 2022 passenger revenues came from the domestic markets. In the third quarter of 2022, passenger revenues, accounting for 82% of the total revenues, were flat with the levels recorded in the comparable quarter of 2019 at $11,464 million. The fourth-quarter 2022 revenue guidance is also encouraging and expected to increase in the 5-9% band from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals.American Airlines’ third-quarter 2022 earnings of 69 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents despite higher costs. The third quarter of 2022 was the second consecutive profitable quarter, excluding net special items, at AAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $13,462 million skyrocketed 50.1% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,457.5 million. Buoyant air-travel demand is also reflected in the total operating revenue increase of 13% from the third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels despite operating at 9.6% lower capacity. In the September quarter, passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line (92.1%), increased to $12,396 million from $7,957 million a year ago, driven by strong air-travel demand, mainly on the domestic front. Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be roughly 11-13%, higher than the level recorded in fourth-quarter 2019.United Airlines’ third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 5 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.81 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 and our estimate of $2.17. The third quarter of 2022 was the second consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $12,877 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,709.5 million and our estimate of $12, 631.6 million. UAL’s revenues increased more than 66% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand. The optimistic air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 13.2% from third-quarter 2019 levels.The massive year-over-year increase in the top line was driven by more than a 75% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 90.5% of the top line) to $11,653 million. Moreover, passenger revenues increased 11.2% from the third-quarter 2019 reading. Nearly 39 million passengers traveled on UAL flights in the September quarter. This implied that passenger volume was 90% of the pre-pandemic volume. Owing to buoyant air-travel demand, UAL anticipates total unit revenues to increase in the 24%-25% band in the December quarter from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals.Coming back to IATA’s forecast, carriers in the Asia Pacific and Latin America are expect to incur losses of $6.6 billion and $795 million, respectively in 2023. Carriers in the Middle East are expected to reap profits of $268 million in 2023.  European carriers, which include the likes of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY, are expected to be profitable in 2023 owing to improved air-travel demand. The profitability is expected to be $621 million as opposed to the anticipated current-year loss of $3.1 billion. In 2023, passenger demand is expected to grow 8.9%, outpacing capacity growth of 6.1%.Reflecting the improved demand scenario, Ryanair’s revenues surged 207% year over year in first-half fiscal 2023 to €2.15 billion on the back of buoyant traffic. Scheduled revenues in the same period increased 250% to €4.42 billion.The number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes were 95.1 million in the first half, up 143% year over year. The traffic was 11% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in first-half fiscal 2023 was 94% compared with 39% a year ago. Ryanair upped its traffic view for fiscal 2023 to 168 million from 165 million. The new guidance indicates 13% growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. Management expects profit after tax in fiscal 2023 in the range of €1 billion to €1.20 billion.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

230,9105cf4e-ac55-3d84-a081-6ce8d8a663a6,TGT,2022-12-08,Is Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) 31% ROE Better Than Average?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporations-nyse-tgt-31-120122797.html,1670500882,STORY,['TGT'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Target How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Target is:31% = US$3.4b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.31.Does Target Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Target has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Multiline Retail industry (35%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Target by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesTarget's Debt And Its 31% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Target, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.51. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

The retail giant's same-store sales growth cooled vs. October, the company reported on Nov. 30.Costco stock subsequently sold off — it is down more than 7% in December — as investors brace for a further sales slowdown in 2023.Here's a lay of the land on Costco ahead of its earnings report:What Yahoo Finance is watchingSales trends in more expensive, discretionary products such as TVs and jewelry;Gross profit margins with inflation coming off its peak;Hints by management at a membership-fee increase in 2023.Costco earnings: View from the C-SuiteCostco CEO Craig Jelinek to Yahoo Finance:""Our jewelry business has slowed down. If you look at the really high-end television sets, they've slowed down. I think right now people are very, very value-conscious. They're always value-conscious, but I think more so now than ever.""Costco CFO Richard Galanti to Yahoo Finance:""Look, over the last six or eight months as there's been inflation and concerns of recession, my answer is: It rains on everyone, maybe it drizzles on us, not hard rain, And so we've done a little better than our peers. This [month] was a slight downtick in those numbers. I've been through this rodeo many times over 38 years. We are just going to keep working to drive sales and drive value.""People shop for food items, including portioned turkey dinners, at a Costco store in Monterey Park, California on November 22, 2022. (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP)What Wall Street is sayingCiti retail analyst Paul Lejuez (neutral rating on Costco's stock):""We estimate Costco's 1Q EPS of $3.01 compared to consensus of $3.12. Comparable sales is known so what really matters is margin. We know that non-foods have been a bit weaker as of late, which we believe may have driven some gross margin pressure from a mix shift to consumables (as we have seen at others like Dollar General and Family Dollar). We estimate gross margin of 10.6% vs consensus of 10.8%. Based on the stock’s recent move lower, some of this gross margin risk has likely been getting priced in. Based on Citi’s quant analysis, Costco is the most crowded stock within our universe, which always makes for a tough setup going into earnings, requiring a near perfect quarter In the case of Dollar General (another crowded stock within our universe), we saw that the less than perfect quarter pressured the stock.""Story continuesCFRA retail analyst Arun Sundaram (hold rating on Costco's stock):""Costco reports fiscal first quarter results on Dec. 8. In addition to weakening discretionary sales, we think Costco could face margin pressure from elevated supply chain costs (retailers have been receiving inventory earlier than expected), greater promotional activity, and higher wages.""More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the mall industry in the US and go directly to 5 Largest Shopping Malls in the United States.The State of the Mall IndustryThe shopping-mall industry in the US grew exponentially from the 50s as suburban life took hold of the country, raising the demand for local shopping centers. Fast-forward to the 21st century, the Internet ushered the US into the age of online shopping, where you can find and buy pretty much whatever you want from the comfort of your couch. This has led to a decline in the shopping-mall appeal. The decline was accelerated during the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 when online shopping grew by 43% according to the US Census Bureau. While shopping malls are still one of the major players in the US retail market, online shopping is projected to account for a third of all retail shopping by 2030, per Kearney, a global management consulting firm. On the other hand, The mall vacancy rate has risen to 8.3% as of Q4 2021, according to data from Statista. This has left the mall REITs with the choice to either evolve or die out. Rate-Hike OnslaughtTo make matters worse, rising interest rates in the US to counter inflation are expected to drive many retailers out of business. Rate hikes are making it harder for consumers to spend money, which is driving the demand for retail goods down. In addition, many retailers had tapped into revolving credit facilities in 2020 to stay in business during lockdowns. The amount these companies borrowed accounted for $145 billion of the $252 billion of total credit, and a significant portion of this amount was variable-rate debt, which is expected to be paid back in the next five years. This means that many retailers would be paying their debt with rising interest rates, at a time when consumers are shopping less. It represents a real risk of driving many retailers out of business, which is further expected to increase the mall vacancy rate through the next five years. Additionally, it’ll make it harder for the survivors to expand their presence in shopping malls. Story continuesFuture of Shopping MallsThe situation on the ground doesn’t look good for shopping mall REITs, but there are ways around irrelevance in the long-term future. According to a Reuters report, Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), the biggest mall-owning REIT in the US, is in talks with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to turn its vacant Sears and J.C. Penney stores into fulfillment centers. Many other shopping malls in North America and Europe are turning towards logistics as the answer to their decreasing revenue in retail. Apart from rising demand for warehouses, logistics also carries financial benefits. The space for retail costs on average $20 per square foot, while the same for warehouse space is only $6.5.Another way the shopping-malls are adapting is by moving more and more towards facilities that are experience-oriented, like event organization, art galleries, cinemas and museums.Now that we know the state of the mall industry, let’s head towards the list of 25 largest shopping malls in the United States.25 Largest Shopping Malls in the United StatesOur MethodologyFor our list of the 25 largest shopping malls in the United States, we’ve ranked them based on their total retail space in square feet.

239,293dbf15-7ee7-3887-82ed-81a2b3f409b3,ADI,2022-12-08,15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-nanotechnology-companies-world-194851468.html,1670442531,STORY,"['GE', 'VECO', 'PPG', 'ADI', 'SNPS', 'CDNS', 'AMAT', 'MMM', 'COHR', 'DD', 'IBM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest nanotechnology companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World. If there is one industry that often sounds as if it is in the realm of science fiction, it is nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the use of materials science industrially involving matter whose dimensions range between one nanometer to 100 nanometers. For reference, a single strand of a human hair ranges anywhere between 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers, so nanotechnology, by definition, involves manipulating matter to sizes that are up to 100,000 times smaller than a hair on your head.Owing to the advantages offered by this unique manipulation, nanotechnology is adopted in a variety of different industries. These include construction, healthcare, and energy. In the construction industry, these technologies are used to create new materials that are durable and provide lucrative benefits such as water resistance, corrosion protection, and even self cleaning. Another widely popular application is the semiconductor industry, which has successfully created transistors that are now as small as 3 nanometers. Healthcare is another segment that benefits from nanotechnology, as nanotubes, owing to their small size, are effective fighters against cancer cells. These treatments involve injecting the nanotubes in the vicinity of cancer cells, and once they are bombarded with lasers, they generate heat that ends up killing the cancer cells. Nanoparticles are also used to bypass the blood-brain barrier due to their small size.Moving towards the industry itself, and growth estimates, the nanotechnology sector is projected to strongly grow due to its novelty and relatively nascent nature. For instance, a research report from Valuates Reports believes that the nanotechnology market was worth $1.76 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.4% between then and 2030 to be worth $33.63 billion by the end of the forecast period. The firm also believes that healthcare will be the largest segment, and nanodevices will be the most lucrative product category. Furthermore, it also outlines that Asia Pacific industry segment will grow at 40%, to outpace the overall industry trend, and the aerospace and defense sector will be the fastest growing user with a whopping 43.4% CAGR.Story continuesAnother report, this time from Atlantic Market Research, estimates a 13.6% CAGR for the nanotechnology market. According to the research firm, the industry will be worth $11.7 billion in 2023. Atlantic Market Research also outlines that electronic applications will hold a 27% market share of the nanotechnology market from 2021 to 2030. It adds that North America held a 21% market share of the nanomaterials market in 2020, and a 38% share of the broader nanotechnology market during the same year.Finally, Precedence Research has the largest estimate for the future value of the nanotechnology market. This research firm believes that the industry was worth $85 billion in 2021, and it will grow to a stunning $288 billion by 2030 through a 14.5% CAGR. Precedence Research also believes that as of May 2022, 20,000 nanotechnology researchers were working in the United States, and despite this, China will be the largest player in the future as well in addition to holding a 35% market share in 2021. Some key trends for the sector include semiconductors and electronics, while hurdles include the difficulties of scaling up the production of the products. These include the recent chip shortages that have created difficulties for both personal computing and automotive markets recently.Today's piece will focus on companies that work in the nanotechnology industry, and it ranges from those that provide the products and services to those that provide backend support. Top players include International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the Worldscience photo/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We took a look at several industries such as chip fabrication, healthcare, and industrials to determine which companies use nanotechnology.

Earlier this month, Regions Bank in Jonesboro assisted with addressing food insecurity by making a $1,000 contribution benefitting the Food Bank of Northeast Arkansas. The donation equates to providing 4,000 meals for those without reliable access to affordable and nutritious food.Northeast Arkansas Consumer Banking associates also personally supported the cause, collecting nearly 1,000 non-perishable food items during the Food Bank of Northeast Arkansas' 30 Days of Giving Campaign conducted each November.Story continues""We know one in four children in our region is at risk of hunger,"" said Michael Miller, market executive for Regions Bank in Jonesboro. ""The Food Bank of Northeast Arkansas has been working with nonprofit community partners for 40 years to address hunger challenges. Our team members have proudly supported their work through canned good drives, personal donations and by participating in their fundraising events.""Food For Thought:A Regions community partner in the Florida Panhandle is working to remove the negative impacts of hunger to empower schoolchildren to get the most out of their education. After learning that students who miss multiple meals outside of school do not learn or develop at the same rate as their peers, the founders of Food For Thought set out to provide year-round access to healthy, easy-to-prepare meals for food-insecure students in Okaloosa and Walton counties.Since 2010, Food for Thought has steadily built on its mission to bridge the meal gap for vulnerable students, and now provides food to 3,400 children across 34 school locations on a weekly basis.Regions associates recently collected nearly $900 in food items and delivered them to Food for Thought. It was enough to fill 554 backpacks to feed 554 schoolchildren.""It was truly a great way for us all to spend time as a team while giving back to our community,"" said Leslie Stricklin, market executive for Regions in Walton County. ""They were certainly impressed with our work ethic and speed. And we all left feeling like we made a big difference.""The H.E.A.R.T. Program:While all nonprofits are full of heart, that's especially true for The Housing, Entrepreneurship and Readiness Training (H.E.A.R.T.) Program in Houston, Texas. Since its 2005 founding, the organization has been creating opportunities for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities to achieve their potential through innovative training, housing and employment programs.Earlier this year, Regions Bank presented The H.E.A.R.T. Program with a $5,250 contribution to support those programs. Several associates from Regions' Houston Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Network also recently attended the nonprofit's annual Have a H.E.A.R.T. Luncheon, which recognizes those who have made a difference in improving the lives of people with special needs or disabilities.Learn more about The H.E.A.R.T. Program's commitment to supporting social entrepreneurism here.Junior Achievement of Dallas:It's an activity-filled business hub where students discover careers, explore entrepreneurism and flex their financial literacy skills. Welcome to Junior Achievement BizTown!Regions Bank has a proud history of working alongside Junior Achievement affiliates in several cities, including JA of Dallas. Earlier this year, Regions contributed $10,000 to support the North Texas nonprofit's educational programs. A group of 10 bank associates also volunteered during a recent JA BizTown simulation day. Stephen Tigh, a Commercial Banking relationship manager and a member of the JA of Dallas board of directors, was one of them.""Volunteering with Junior Achievement offers me an opportunity to make a positive impact on the next generation by sharing my life experiences and career in banking,"" said Tigh. ""When Regions leverages our capital and team members to support JA's workforce readiness and entrepreneurship programs, we're not just investing in our children, we're also helping to ensure a prosperous future for our community.""Take a deeper look at the many programs JA of Dallas conducts.Money Moves Baton Rouge:Louisiana residents from all walks of life are being hit hard by the financial impacts of inflation, natural disasters, global supply chain disruptions, and more. Unfortunately, among the 50 states, Louisiana ranks low in basic financial literacy. More people need access to financial skills and trustworthy information to navigate these challenging times and meet their families' current, future, and emergency needs.To help address this need, on Nov. 12, NPR news radio station WRKF 89.3 FM, launched a free financial literacy conference, Money Moves Baton Rouge, to provide trustworthy financial information for sound financial decisions.Regions Bank was the lead donor of funds for Money Moves Baton Rouge. Regions bankers also presented seminars on budgeting, saving, credit, and other financial wellness topics.""We believe it is never too early to have those important conversation s about how to save more, spend wisely, and manage credit in a productive way,"" said Amy Province, Baton Rouge market executive for Regions Bank. ""We are happy to work with WRKF and other groups to help families plan for, and reach, their unique financial goals. As more people become financially secure, there is a tremendous benefit for you personally, for your family, and four our Baton Rouge community as a whole.""Interested in seeing how Regions lent its support to the community during previous years?

(NYSE:V) sold US$9.6m worth of stock at an average price of US$217 a share over the past year, making the most of their investment. The company’s market cap plunged by US$19b after price dropped by 4.2% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Visa Visa Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent sale by Rajat Taneja was the biggest sale of Visa shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$208. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Visa insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Visa Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Visa shares. In total, insiders dumped US$9.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$228m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Visa Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Visa is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

However, there is a lack of understanding amongst consumers that many of their behaviours are already working towards a more sustainable future and by adopting these behaviours more often will accelerate changes in this area.The 6 RsRecommerce behaviours which include Resale, Refill, Repair, Rental and Return and Redistribute - defined as sharing, exchanging or selling at lower prices things that one no longer needs or has too much of - are referred to by Visa as the six Rs. Out of the six Rs, Resale is the most well-known and understood of all the behaviours with over 47% of consumers reselling goods at least twice a year. Over one in five (23%) of small businesses in the UK already provide Resale options with 37% planning to do so in the future. Over a quarter (29%) of consumers are motivated to pay for items to be repaired, refurbished or adapted as it will save them money in the long term. Consumers are the most motivated to engage in Repair to extend the life of high-quality products. Refill is used by consumers to cut back on waste, with 20% of those who participate doing so as it fits with their values. Return includes taking or accepting products back at the end of their life cycle, and alongside resale, is one of the most likely activities to be provided by UK businesses.5Story continuesConsumer Motivations – The rise of the 'Environmental Entrepreneur'The latest study from Visa and Opinium shows that recognising the financial opportunities for the business savvy and understanding the potential for cost savings are key to encouraging Recommerce. 32% of adults surveyed said that they would take part in Recommerce activities more frequently if they could find a way to make money from their actions, such as setting up an app to sell used clothing or furniture or receiving cash incentives to redistribute surplus food. Indeed, already over half (53%) of UK adults who participated in Recommerce say they have already saved money through it.Environmental benefits are also a key driver for consumers. Visa has found that over four in five of adults in the UK have actively taken part in environmentally friendly activities over the past three months, with the vast majority (90%) stating that they felt that using less packaging has an impact on the environment and society. As 40% identified reducing waste, packaging or plastic as the main reason for taking part in the Recommercial economy, it is clear that the combination of environmental concerns, and costs are driving Recommerce uptake.Working TogetherAs a global payments network, Visa intends to make it easier, more rewarding, and more accessible for people and businesses to consider Recommerce in their daily choices. Working with Strategic Partners such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, an international charity that develops a promotes the  circular economy — which is designed to eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerate nature — Visa is striving to help accelerate the transition towards a more regenerative circular economy.Visa has created a new digital Recommerce space to help individuals and businesses learn more, with educational resources on how to adopt the six R's of Recommerce: Resale, Repair, Rental, Refill, Return and Redistribution. As a next step, Visa is set to develop a behavioural insights lab. Through experimentation and working with clients and partners to uncover findings, the lab aims to uncover actionable ways to implement real-world solutions and empower individuals to adopt more sustainable behaviours in their everyday life. ""The new Behavioural Insights Lab will conduct experiments to further this ambition, with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation ensuring its Circular Design Principles are incorporated and that pre-competitive opportunities may be advanced through its network,"" says Joe Murphy, Executive Lead, Network, at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.Mandy Lamb, Managing Director, UK&amp;I, Visa""It's inspiring to see that UK consumers are leading the way in taking up Recommerce behaviours, and their appetite to learn more about sustainable spending. The shift from a linear to a regenerative economy requires big societal change, but by setting expectations high and rethinking our habits with the help of education, we can all achieve this shift to a more sustainable future. Through Visa's Recommerce behavioural insights lab, we are excited to work with partners to uncover real-world solutions that will empower individuals to make the circular economy a bigger part of everyday life.""Opportunities for small businesses – Recommerce proven to boost businessAs consumer preferences change, so to do the opportunities for businesses. By 2030, it is estimated that the transition to a circular economy in the UK will be a £82 billion economic opportunity6, with the data indicating this is already being felt by businesses.7 UK small businesses report that offering Recommerce has correlated to business growth, reporting their revenue has grown on average 17% in the last 2 years, with cost savings around 12%. Most consumers (55%) indicated that they were more likely to buy products or services from businesses that help them to participate in Recommerce activities, shooting up to 63% among 18-34year olds. This is being noticed by businesses, as 37% have said customer demand was the main motivation behind offering a Recommerce model.However, while the future of sustainable business practices is promising, participating in the Recommercial economy is not yet commonplace. 38% of adults that stated that will do so once activities become easier and more convenient to use, and over half of those who have taken part (51%) said their motivation was around reducing clutter over more sustainability focused priorities.For more information about Visa's Recommerce initiative and to join Visa to shape and accelerate the transition to a more circular economy, please visit: https://www.visa.co.uk/recommerce.htmlNOTES TO EDITORSAbout the researchResearch commissioned by Visa and conducted by Opinium with 8,000 European consumers and 2,000 European SMB decision makers, between 19th October 2022 and 25th October 2022. The data was collected using an online survey in the UK, France, Germany and Poland.Visa commissioned GlobeScan, an independent insights and strategy consultancy to conduct an online survey to understand current SMB and consumer behaviours as well as future appetite for Recommerce. The study surveyed 7,000 consumers and 1,750 micro, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), using established online research panels across 7 countries: France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, UK. The consumer sample is nationally representative of n=1,000 adults aged 18+ per country, with quotas set by age, region, gender, and education. SMBs were defined as: businesses with less than 250 employees, and a turnover of less than €50 million in the last financial year, further divided under micro (&gt;10 employees), small (10-49 employees) and medium (50-249 employees) businesses.*""Case studies, comparisons, statistics, research and recommendations are provided ""AS IS"" and intended for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for operational, marketing, legal, technical, tax, financial or other advice.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the free market as it pertains to ethical conduct in the US and go directly to 5 Most Ethical Companies in the US. Young people are becoming increasingly awake to the social, historical, climate and financial injustices and choose to give business to, and invest in companies that share their values. Many corporations have responded positively to the development. “Ethical” CapitalismTo give you a quantitative perspective on the corporate ethical turn, Yale School of Management has compiled a list of 138 corporations with extended women’s benefits, not offered by other corporations. Out of these, nearly a third are tech corporations. The most prominent ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In terms of doing business in Russia, over a 1,000 corporations (majority of them American) have left the country after it invaded the neighboring Ukraine. Evidence indicates that the equity market’s reward to the companies for the action far outweighs the potential loss from leaving Russia. On the other hand, companies that are still engaged in business with Russia are being punished by investors. At the sustainability front, many companies have adopted “planet friendly” policies to lower the burden on Earth’s ecosystem and climate. However, most of the corporate sector has been called out several times for “greenwashing” and not actually doing enough. Regardless, the companies we’ve discussed are doing their part for sustainability as well as social and financial justice. ESG’s Impact on a Company’s Financial PerformanceESG refers to the Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance. It's a set of standards that impact-investors look at when investing based on values. Stern School of Business carried out a meta-analysis of a 1,000 studies on ESG, done between the period of 2015-2020, and concluded that ESG and corporate financial performance had a statistically significant positive correlation for 58% of the studies. The analysis also discovered that corporate investments in sustainability were actually advantageous in the long-term while having no impact on financial performance in the short-term.Story continuesNow that we have the perspective on the ethical free market, let’s move on to the list of 22 most ethical companies in the US. 22 Most Ethical Companies in the USPhoto by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 22 most ethical companies in the US, we’ve ranked them based on how many times they’ve been hailed as honorees for being ethical up until 2022 by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in assessing ethical businesses.We’ve also mentioned each company’s ESG-risk scores from Sustainalytics, a premier ESG grader.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Visa (V).Visa currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.27, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.27 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 81.8% and 9.1% of all recommendations.Check price target &amp; stock forecast for Visa here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Visa, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is V a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Visa, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.30.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Visa.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Dips, Albeit Not by MuchBy James RubinIn soccer World Cup terms, bitcoin's performance the past 10 days would be the equivalent of a 0-0 draw.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization isn't losing or gaining much ground. On Wednesday, BTC was recently trading at about $16,850. That was down more than 1% over the past 24 hours but didn't offer much variance from its perch since late November when bitcoin established support above $17,000.In an interview with CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" TV program, Joe Orsini, vice president of research at digital asset management platform Eaglebrook Advisors, attributed bitcoin's toughness to an at least temporary slowdown in bad news stemming from the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and other crypto fiascos this year.""When it comes to the unexpected, no news is good news,"" Orsini said. ""We've had a few things play out since the FTX news, of course, the BlockFi bankruptcy that was relatively priced in knowing they kind of relied on that FTX-Alameda bailout, as well as now you have concerns with some of the lenders. But it's been slow to play out, and there hasn't been that second wave of shock.""Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,230, off 2.8% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red, albeit not by much, as investors continued to gnaw on recent economic indicators suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy had not taken as big a bite out of inflation as was hoped. SUSHI, the token of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap was recently off more than 8%, while popular meme coin DOGE fell more than 3.5%.Story continuesThe CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, tumbled 1.59%.Cryptos roughly tracked U.S. equity markets, which were most down, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 dropping 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, amid inflationary fears, although stocks performance improved over the steeper drops of the previous two days. Markets received an extra whiff of encouragement on Wednesday when China announced it was dropping its harshest Covid restrictions. China's measures to limit mortalities from the disease have been slowing the economic growth of the world's second largest economy by GDP.Eaglebrook Advisors' Orsini said that additional contagion could unsettle markets. ""The important thing to consider is if the news does come, and if there is real contagion, does it lead to forced selling or liquidations or stronger selling pressure?"" he asked, although he remained upbeat about a crypto rebound.""Price does have a knack for changing sentiment,"" he said. ""When things are on sale, people want them less. We believe in the long run that these event-driven declines have very little meaning to underlying technology. Bitcoin has specific characteristics that it a really attractive form of money, and potentially to take market share away from fiat. And with Etherium, the ability to automate transactions, and the quality of entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem is not changing.""Orsini added: ""Cycles happen, and so we've been in a bear market for about 13 months, and those (bear markets) were where the opportunities lie for long-term investors.""Biggest GainersThere are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.Biggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorCosmosATOM−5.3%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL−4.9%Smart Contract PlatformGalaGALA−4.8%EntertainmentInsightsHow will FTX Contagion Affect Sino Global Capital?By Sam ReynoldsConnections between Sino Global Capital’s Liquid Value Fund, its first fund for outside investment, and Sam Bankman-Fried as well as Alameda Research, might mean the venture capital fund is mentioned in FTX’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings, according to a Hong Kong lawyer who specializes in asset tracing.According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Sino Global’s Liquid Value counts Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda as general partners and co-owners of the fund.In a prior comment to The Block, Matthew Graham, Sino Global’s founder, who has been historically closely aligned with SBF and FTX, said that a “substantial” portion of the Liquid Value fund’s $200 million had been committed by FTX and other partners.According to a recent report by the Financial Times, which detailed all of Alameda’s investments, the Bankman-Fried-affiliated fund put $60 million into Sino Global’s Liquid Value Fund. An unknown amount was then contributed by SBF himself.These events will complicate FTX and Alameda’s process in their bankruptcy hearings, says Stephen Chan, a partner at Hong Kong-based law firm Ince.“If they are in a partnership, all partners share in the upside and the downside,” Chan said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The other partners may incur liability for the actions of SBF and Alameda.”A material amount of Alameda’s balance sheet was made up of FTX’s FTT token, as CoinDesk previously reported, which it used for collateral on investments. If Alameda funded part, or all, of its contribution to Sino Global’s Liquid Value fund via FTT, then this pool of assets – and whatever they were invested in – would be a part of what’s available to creditors.If it turns out that SBF and his cohorts were committing fraud and some of SBF’s partners were in knowing receipt of proceeds of fraud, Chan explained, there would be a slightly different route under Hong Kong common law (the fund is domiciled there, and FTX/Alameda had a significant presence in the territory).“If SBF is a general partner, then the partnership may have liability,” Chan said.In instances of fraud, liquidators working on the FTX-Alameda case may look to recipients of proceeds of fraud to see whether civil recovery is possible.But all of this might be challenging, to say the least. Sino Global is heavily invested in Solana and its respective infrastructure.CoinGecko data shows that Solana has suffered a 93% loss during the last year, and in the weeks following FTX’s collapse nearly $700 million in locked-in value has been wiped out from Solana decentralized finance protocols.The token of Orca, a Solana-based decentralized exchange that is one of Sino Global’s leading portfolio companies, reached a high of $20 in October 2021; it is now worth just over 40 cents. Its total value locked went from $1.4 billion at its height to $43.15 million today, according to DeFiLlama.FTX’s FTT token is currently trading at $1.51, up 14% during the last two weeks, but down 95% on the month. Recently, its contract deployer has dumped the entirety of the locked FTT tokens into circulation, effectively flooding the market with what is already a token of questionable value.Important events8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC) Australia Trade Balance (MoM/Oct)8:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:00 UTC) European Central Bank's President Christine Lagarde Speech9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Initial Jobless ClaimsCoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Dips Under $17K; Sam Bankman-Fried Hires Attorney Mark Cohen: ReportFormer FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has hired high-profile defense attorney Mark Cohen, the same attorney who represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex-trafficking trial, according to Reuters.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Gensler, who declined to specifically talk about failed crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said in an interview on Yahoo! Finance that the SEC has the basic disclosure and governance requirements in place to hold digital-assets firms accountable.The SEC chief also didn’t directly address questions about whether his agency would push out tailored crypto rules next year, but he insisted that it doesn’t need any. “The rules are there,” he said. “The law firms know how to advise their clients to comply.”FTX’s crash showed the dangers of running a global platform without walls between customer funds and investment operations, Gensler said. Crypto firms can’t do everything. “Your field will not last long outside of public policy norms,” he said.The court case over whether Ripple’s XRP is a security has been seen as the major lingering question holding the agency back, but Gensler said Wednesday that a federal judge’s decision last month determining that crypto startup LBRY violated securities laws by selling its native LBC tokens was a “very big win” for the SEC’s legal campaign.So far, the SEC hasn’t directly gone after U.S. exchange Coinbase (COIN) for listing what the agency believes are securities without registering as a national securities exchange. Still, the SEC has – in another recent enforcement action – listed several tokens it considers unregistered securities that were traded on the company’s platform.Token Roundup(CoinDesk Research)Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,800, down about a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has held comfortably above $17,000 for much of the past nine days, despite ongoing investor jitters about contagion linked to the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly signs since late last week that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to maintain its hawkish course on interest rate hikes through 2023.Story continuesSushiSwap (SUSHI): The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is facing a significant deficit in its treasury that threatens its long-term operational viability, according to a governance proposal from project developers. After reviewing expenditures, the project's annual runway requirement was reduced from $9 million to $5 million, but the treasury still provides for only about 18 months of runway, developers said.Axie Infinity (AXS): The native token of the blockchain-based play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, has come out of oblivion this week with a double-digit price rally. Yet, leverage traders appear skeptical if AXS' turnaround from 17-month lows would be longlasting. That's because while open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active standard futures and perpetual futures contracts tied to AXS, has increased to a three-month high of $129.70 million, funding rates remain negative, according to data source Coinglass.Latest PricesCoinDesk Market Index (CMI)850.81 −11.4 ▼ 1.3%  Bitcoin (BTC)$16,814 −174.0 ▼ 1.0%  Ethereum (ETH)$1,230 −25.5 ▼ 2.0%  S&amp;P 500 daily close3,933.92 −7.3 ▼ 0.2%  Gold$1,799 +29.4 ▲ 1.7%  Treasury Yield 10 Years3.41% ▼ 0.1  BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price.

If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter. Increased short-term rates and slower economic growth lead to lower demand and prices for physical and digital assets.10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Constant Maturity (Fred Database)Read the full technical take here.Other NewsCoinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brian Armstong said the company’s revenue will be about half what it was last year as the crypto exchange struggles amid stark price drops in cryptocurrencies and continuing ripple effects from multiple bankruptcies this year, including the recent collapse of rival exchange FTX. Armstrong noted in an interview with Bloomberg’s David Rubenstein that Coinbase had done about $7 billion in revenue ($7.8 billion, according to FactSet) and $4 billion in positive EBITDA. “It's looking, you know, about roughly half that or less,” Armstrong said.Genesis interim CEO Derar Islim wrote in a letter to customers Wednesday that resolution of his company’s lending unit’s withdrawal freeze is likely to be a matter of “weeks” rather than days. The lending arm of Genesis in November was forced to suspend redemptions following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.

An inversion in the U.S. yield curve was also perceived by several market participants as an indicator of an impending recession.But while gold has largely lost its safe haven status this year, speculation that the dollar has peaked this year weighed on the greenback drove recent flows into the yellow metal.Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,783.11 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,795.15 an ounce by 20:17 ET (01:17 GMT). Both instruments rallied nearly 1% each on Wednesday, amid growing concerns over a U.S. recession.Focus this week is on U.S. producer inflation data for November, due on Friday, to gauge the path of price pressures in the country.While inflation eased in October, it still remained well above the Federal Reserve’s target range. Signs of strength in consumer spending and the jobs market also raised concerns over inflation remaining stickier than expected in the coming months.Such a scenario is likely to invite more hawkish moves by the Fed. While the central bank is expected to hike rates by a smaller margin next week, it has warned that U.S. rates could peak at higher-than-expected levels in the face of stubborn inflation.Rising U.S. interest rates weighed heavily on gold prices this year, and a hawkish outlook from the Fed is likely to further dent the yellow metal.Among industrial metals, copper prices were flat on Thursday after two straight days of gains, amid optimism over an economic reopening in China.Copper futures steadied around $3.8448 a pound after rising nearly 1% in the past two sessions.China announced the further relaxation of anti-COVID curbs this week, driving up hopes of an eventual economic recovery in the world’s largest copper importer.Story continuesBut the country is still struggling with record-high daily increases in infections. Slowing economic growth in the rest of the world could also potentially weigh on copper demand in the near-term, keeping prices subdued.Related ArticlesGold hovers below $1,800, recession fears spur some safe haven demandPutin acknowledges Russia's war in Ukraine could be a long oneOil prices steady after hitting 2022 lows]"

If you want to read about some more gold stocks, go directly to 5 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For Recession.According to a report by S&amp;P Global, the sentiments for gold investment have risen over the past few months due to higher inflation and increasing geopolitical risks surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Latest research shows that the global gold mining market will grow from $214.1 billion in 2021 to $249.6 billion by 2026, at a compound annual growth rate of 3.1% for the period of 2021-2026.

Then the pandemic lockdowns hit, and Stewart was suddenly working remotely. An avid gamer, Stewart built his own PC in his free hours, rekindling his childhood passion for tech. Soon, he started reimagining what his new career could be.Verizon, Wednesday, December 7, 2022, Press release pictureWhen a friend pointed him to Verizon Skill Forward, Stewart signed up for the full-time IT Support Specialist program offered in partnership with Generation USA. He remembers posing himself one question: ‘What do you have to lose?' Turns out the answer was nothing. But he had the world to gain. After completing the 12-week training, acquiring hard skills such as IT Google certification, and soft skills such as leadership and customer service, Stewart is now a business systems analyst at a fintech company. Not only does he earn a higher salary, he loves his new career where thrives on problem-solving. ""Now, it's like everyday is new,"" he says.Q. Aside from building your own PC, what sparked you to jump into IT?A. My friends from college were all working for great companies and their salaries were growing and mine had not. I said, ""Something isn't right. Something needs to happen."" Inflation was rising and it was getting tough.Q. How did Verizon Skill Forward help prepare you to excel in tech?A. When I interviewed for my current role, they asked me how many hours of troubleshooting I did, and how many hours of technical assistance and support. There was a whole segment on troubleshooting in the program that really helped out.Q. What did you find most interesting about the program?A. The program has different modules and they start out with the people aspect of things. What people sometimes don't understand is that technology is very people-oriented. Although we're dealing with software and technology, people are using the software and technology so you have to understand how people think in order to build apps.Story continuesQ. Did you get a job right away?A. I made it to the final round of interviews with a fintech firm. But I didn't get the job. A couple of months went by and I was still working at the medical supply firm. People started to leave the company and that's when, after four years, they offered me the position that I was wanting-and a 10% raise-but for a trial period. It didn't sit right with me, but I did it for two months. In the meantime, the fintech company called and said they had one last contract position as an IT analyst - providing tech solutions, fixing glitches, and developing apps-and it was mine if I wanted it. I told them to start the paperwork!Q. What are the best aspects of making a career change?A. I love the autonomy of being able to work on my own, but also doing great work with a team. Although I don't have the label of team lead, after I finish with my work for the day, I field questions from the team. If something goes wrong, they usually come to me first. Or when my manager tells me I did a great job. That feels great.Verizon Skill Forward is an initiative in partnership with nonprofit Generation USA that aims to close the opportunity gap for American workers by expanding access to professional and soft skills needed for careers in tech.

If you want to read about some more communication stocks to buy today, go directly to 5 Best Communication Stocks To Buy Today.The communications industry has grown from a sector that used to include just telecommunications, newspapers, magazines, books, and radio and television broadcasting to one that also encompasses the world of internet and software-as-a-service providers. On a global level, it is one of the biggest and most stable businesses. Over the past year, the incredible rise in demand for higher-speed networks, partially as a result of more businesses going digital, has resulted in huge fiber and wireless deployments. As a new year beckons, there is an emerging set of issues and opportunities presented by a dynamic regulatory, technological, and competitive environment that may influence progress in the communications space. Per a report by research firm Deloitte, the biggest trends shaping the telecommunications industry are more competitive broadband markets and cybersecurity in the 5G era. The Economist Intelligence Unit claims that artificial intelligence will continue to develop after several breakthroughs in the area too. These growth trends are also reflected in governmental policies. For example, the United States government recently passed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has earmarked over $65 billion for the upgradation of broadband networks across the country, boosting communications stocks. The software side in the business is growing rapidly, some estimates place the annual growth of this sub-space in the communications sector at more than 6%. There is also spending on expanded options for high-quality communication and internet services.The enterprise market for private cellular networks and edge computing is gaining momentum as well. The market is still nascent but promises to be competitive in near future. Network operators will have to compete against each other as well as new players, who may prove key partners in delivering future tech solutions. While the widespread adoption of 5G offers many benefits, it also creates new security concerns and challenges. The operators have taken steps to evaluate and minimize threats arising from 5G and software-centric networks. Story continuesTaking advantage of the situation, they are in a unique position to offer 5G security services to enterprises seeking to deploy their own advanced wireless networks. The challenges outlined can be overcome by reevaluating business models in terms of both service offerings and geographies. Companies can also look for ways to differentiate services on non-performance attributes. Some of the top firms in the sector include T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), Charter Communications, Inc.

Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) provides broadband communications and video services in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. On November 2, Altice USA posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $0.19, missing market estimates by $0.16. The revenue over the period was $2.39 billion, down 7.0% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and missing market estimates by $60 million. On November 9, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft maintained a Hold rating on Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) stock and lowered the price target to $6 from $9, highlighting that the company's results for the third quarter can be summarized as a slight worsening of trends from a competitive point of view.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm HG Vora Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) with 15 million shares worth more than $87.5 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, MPE Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Two (very) costly mistakes I’ve made over the last twelve months have been my investments in Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) and Poshmark. Both are down over 50% from my initial purchase price. I not only poorly appraised business quality; I also incorrectly appraised the intrinsic value of both of these companies. It should rarely end up being the case that we pay over intrinsic value, in the worst case we should never lose money on an investment. I will dive into one of these mistakes below and maybe dive into the other in a future letter. My thinking when buying Altice USA was that they operate as a duopoly in their main footprint, the New York Tri-State area. They provide a needs-based service: internet, video, and voice services. I figured this is a very stable business with high barriers to entry. Management seemed competent as well based on historical capital allocation decisions. I didn’t fully appreciate at the time how poorly positioned they were relative to Verizon Fios, as well as how fiercely competitive the business can get on promotions and customer acquisition.Altice offers hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) while Fios offers fiber-to-the-home (FTTH). FTTH is a far superior product, which has led to some share loss to Fios in the parts of their footprint that overlap. There have also been some subscriber losses in their other footprint due to new cable entrants and fixed wireless offerings.My original thinking was that the video business will go to zero over time due to continued pressure from services like Netflix. In hindsight, I overstated their free cash flows excluding the video business due to difficulties disaggregating their business results. This FCF delta is a huge contributor to the difference between my current and original estimates of intrinsic value. Now, it’s possible that the video business doesn’t go to zero; however, I have a hard time envisioning that many households in ten years will still subscribe to linear television.After losing some subscribers and facing some headwinds, they are now reinvesting many billions over the next few years to fiberize the majority of their footprint. I think this is a great plan and it will hopefully cement their position as a true duopoly in the New York TriState area. However, in their other major footprint, new fiber entrants are coming in and competition will only intensify. There are also some new entrants entering this space like Starlink satellite internet and fixed wireless internet from tier-one mobile carriers. I think these will generally be more expensive and inferior to FTTH; however, they may end up putting some pricing pressure on Altice over time.”7. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61     AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) provides telecommunications, media, and technology services worldwide. On November 2, AT&amp;T revealed that it is expanding its existing credit facility to $12 billion from $7.5 billion. The company said that advances would be used for general corporate purposes.

(NYSE:T), compared to 55 in the previous quarter worth $1.7 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Chartwell Investment Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In the Dividend Equity accounts, the three best performers in Q2 include AT&amp;T (NYSE:T, 2.5%), up 17.1%. AT&amp;T completed the spin of the WarnerMedia business (HBO, CNN, etc.), and the market seemed to like the “back-to-basics” approach. Also, the telco business is expected to do relatively well in an inflationary environment.”6. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62  Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) offers communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities worldwide.

(NYSE:VZ) stock and lowered the price target to $41 from $58, highlighting that the firm was able to avoid another guidance cut but investors still have questions about the forward strategy given struggles to grow the consumer postpaid phone base in a strong wireless market.

(NYSE:VZ) with 8 million shares worth more than $304.6 million. Alongside T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), and Alphabet Inc.

(NYSE:VZ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged behind the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been impacted as the wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Communication Stocks To Buy Today. Suggested Articles:15 Most Advanced Countries in the World10 Stocks Under $50 To Buy15 Most Famous Investment Gurus of All TimeDisclosure.

MDRX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strategic alliances over the past few months. A robust third-quarter 2022 performance and its business model are expected to contribute further. Yet, concerns related to foreign exchange and consolidation in the healthcare industry persist.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 0.3% against the 65.8% decline of the industry and 17.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500 so far this year.This renowned IT solutions and services provider has a market capitalization of $2.04 billion. The company projects 16.3% growth over the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. MDRX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, the average earnings surprise being 38.35%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper:Strategic Alliances: We are optimistic about Allscripts’ partnerships over the past few months. During the second quarter, its Veradigm Life Sciences’ real world evidence data and analytics team signed numerous multi-year data agreements. One notable deal among them was a multi-year deal with a top five pharma company to provide data for their research and clinical development teams.Other notable developments include Valley Oaks Medical Group’s selection of Allscripts’ professional EHR practice management and clearing house and expansion of Allscripts’ relationship with Southeast Medical Group, both confirmed in August.Business Model: Allscripts delivers IT solutions and services to help healthcare organizations achieve optimal clinical, financial and operational results, which raises our optimism about the stock. The company sells its solutions to physicians, hospitals and governments, to name a few, besides post-acute organizations, such as home health and hospice agencies.Allscripts helps its clients to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare with solutions that include electronic health records, information connectivity, private cloud hosting, outsourcing, analytics, patient access and population health management. It derives its revenues primarily from sales of proprietary software, support and maintenance services, and managed services.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Allscripts’ solid third-quarter 2022 performance buoys optimism regarding the stock. The year-over-year uptick in the top line and revenues from both segments during the quarter is impressive. Allscripts is progressing well via its mergers and acquisitions, which raises our confidence in the stock. The gross margin and operating margin expansion is another positive.Downsides   Foreign Exchange Concerns: Allscripts conducts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but reports its financial results in U.S. dollars. As a result, the company faces exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make its products and services more expensive for global clients.Consolidation in the Healthcare Industry: Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power, which decrease the number of market participants. Thus, competition to provide products and services like Allscripts will intensify and the importance of establishing and maintaining relationships with key industry participants will increase. These industry participants may use their market power to negotiate price reductions for Allscripts’ products and services.Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.

The latest three year period has also seen a 27% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.0% per year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Air Products and Chemicals' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.What We Can Learn From Air Products and Chemicals' P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Air Products and Chemicals maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected.

This mega-scale renewable power to hydrogen project includes approximately 1.4 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar power generation, along with electrolyzer capacity capable of producing over 200 metric tons per day (MT/D) of green hydrogen, making it the largest green hydrogen facility in the United States.The new facility will be, by far, the largest green hydrogen facility in the U.S. to use wind and sun as energy sources.The facility, which is targeted to begin commercial operations in 2027, will serve growing demand for zero-carbon intensity fuels for the mobility market as well as other industrial markets. It will yield a totally clean source of energy on a massive scale, and, if all the green hydrogen were used in the heavy-duty truck market, it would eliminate more than 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually when compared to diesel use in heavy-duty trucks. Over the project lifetime, it is expected to avoid more than 50 million metric tons of CO2, the equivalent of avoiding emissions from nearly five billion gallons of diesel fuel.Air Products and AESi will jointly and equally own the renewable energy and electrolyzer assets, with Air Products serving as the exclusive off-taker and marketer of the green hydrogen under a 30-year contract.The project would create more than 1,300 construction and 115 permanent operations jobs, as well as about 200 transportation and distribution jobs. It is also expected to generate approximately $500 million in tax benefits to the state over the course of the project's lifetime, while extending Texas' energy leadership.Story continues""We are very pleased to announce this exciting joint venture with AES, which is one of the leading renewable energy companies in America. The new facility in Texas will be, by far, the largest mega-scale clean hydrogen production facility in the U.S. to use wind and sun as energy sources. We have been working on the development of this project with AES for many years and it will be competitive on a world-scale while bringing significant tax, job and energy security benefits to Texas. We are excited to move forward and make clean green hydrogen available to U.S. customers in the near future,"" said Seifi Ghasemi, Air Products' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.AES President and Chief Executive Officer Andrés Gluski stated, ""This project will capitalize on AES' position as one of the nation's largest renewable energy developers and its global leadership in innovations such as energy storage systems and supplying around the clock clean energy to data centers. We are very pleased to partner with the world leader in hydrogen, Air Products, for this first of its kind mega-scale green hydrogen facility in the United States. We will build more than 1 GW of new solar and wind facilities to provide zero carbon energy for electrolysis and related production facilities. AES believes that green hydrogen has a key role to play in decarbonizing transportation and accelerating the future of energy.""Demand for green hydrogen for mobility and industrial applications is expected to grow exponentially across the United States over the next decade. The growth in demand is supported by green hydrogen's role in net-zero ambitions announced by several states and major corporations. The project is subject to receipt of local permits, and local, state and federal incentives.i Alberta Investment Management Company (AIMCo) is an investor in AES' clean energy business in the United States with 25% ownership in the business' growth projects.About Air Products Air Products (NYSE: APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets.

(NYSE:APD) are up almost 6% in 2022.Why Air Products &amp; Chemicals Isn't Done Going HigherConsidering the S&amp;P 500 Index has declined 17.5% and the industrial sector is lower by more than 15% year to date, this mid-single-digit gain is very impressive.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with APD. Click here to check it out. APD 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of APDPeter Lynch Chart of APDEven with the overall market showing weakness, Air Products &amp; Chemicals recently established a new all-time high of $320.62 and sits just below this level at the moment. Yet, the stock is still trading below its GF Value.Despite outperforming the broader market and its own sector for the year, I believe Air Products &amp; Chemicals has several tailwinds that should enable the stock to continue to climb higher. This discussion will examine why I believe the stock offers value even as it sits just off of a new all-time high.Takeaways from recent earnings resultsOne of the primary reasons that Air Products &amp; Chemicals still has upside potential is due to the strength of its earnings results. The company reported fourth-quarter 2022 results on Nov. 3. Revenue surged almost 26% to $3.57 billion, which was still $339 million more than had been anticipated by analysts covering the name.Adjusted earnings per share of $2.89 increased 38 cents, or 15.1%, from the prior year and were 13 cents better than expected.Strong results were not just a one-quarter occurrence either. Fiscal year revenue grew 23% to $12.7 billion, while adjusted earnings per share of $10.41 was an increase of $1.38, or 15.3%.Both quarterly and full fiscal year results came off of very good growth rates in the comparable periods. Revenue growth for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 was 22% and 17%, respectively, while adjusted earnings per share improved 8% for fiscal year 2022 and 15% for the comparable quarter.Air Products &amp; Chemicals has long enjoyed high growth rates.Story continuesWhy Air Products &amp; Chemicals Isn't Done Going HigherSource: Investor PresentationThe company has had such stellar results for a long period of time because of the importance of industrial gases in industrial functions. Industrial gases are usually a small portion of costs for the companys customers, but they are needed so that production does not become disrupted. Industrial gases are essential to industrial production. This provides Air Products &amp; Chemicals, one of the largest companies in its industry, to sit in a very advantageous position.As such, customers are typically willing to sign long-term agreements and are accepting of price increases. Long-term agreements provide the company with a reasonable expectation for future revenue sources. Price increases can help offset higher costs.This is what helped drive growth in the most recent quarter. Of the growth seen in the period, 15% was related to higher energy cost pass-through. Higher realized prices added 8%, but this did not impact demand very much as volume improved 9%. Despite higher costs to customers, demand was still elevated, once again showing Air Products &amp; Chemicals key positioning in its industry. These gains were offset by a 6% headwind from currency exchange rates.Looking closer at individual segments, revenue for the Americas business improved 38%, with volume growth adding 12% and price increases contributing 8%. Asia grew 14%, mostly due to a 16% increase in volume. Pricing added 3%. Europe was up 34%. Price hikes were felt the most here, as they increased 19%. Even with the magnitude of pricing hikes, volume was essentially flat for the region.All three of the companys areas of operation saw high levels of growth. Again, these came on the heels of impressive growth rates in the prior year. For the same period of fiscal 2021, revenue for the Americas, Asia and Europe grew 22%, 6% and 33%, respectively. The ability to raise prices and see volume growth in the two largest regions and remain stable in the third region speaks to the need for the industrial gases that Air Products &amp; Chemicals supplies to its customers.Not all the news was good for the period, however. Net income did fall 4% year over year, primarily due to the divestiture of Air Products &amp; Chemicals Russian operations and the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The net income margin fell 520 basis points to 16.6%, with about half of the decrease attributed to higher energy cost pass-through.Still, the majority of the news was positive for the company and management expects its business will continue to perform at a high rate in the new fiscal year. Adjusted earnings per share is projected to be in a range of $11.20 to $11.50, representing growth of 9% at the midpoint.Air Products &amp; Chemicals has invested heavily over the years to ensure its leading market position. To that end, the company spent $11 billion over the past five fiscal years on projects. The company has a backlog of nearly $16 billion that it intends to invest over the next half-decade.The following is a list of major projects that the company has signed agreements for.Why Air Products &amp; Chemicals Isn't Done Going HigherSource: Investor PresentationAir Products &amp; Chemicals is also working toward increasing its exposure to green energy. Some recent updates to the project list include an additional $500 million investment in a sustainable aviation fuel project in California, bringing the total investment to $2.5 billion.The company also has a $5 billion joint venture in Saudi Arabia that will produce green ammonia for export and will be powered by renewable energy. In addition, Air Products &amp; Chemicals has multiple carbon-free of net-zero hydrogen plants in development, which will only improve its positioning within the green energy movement.This aggressive investment in its business should also help the company to keep its dividend growth streak of 40 years going as well.Air Products &amp; Chemicals has a GF Score of 89 out of 100, implying the potential for moderate outperformance going forward. This score is driven by solid marks in the areas of profitability, growth, momentum and financial strength and a middling score on value.Why Air Products &amp; Chemicals Isn't Done Going HigherValuation analysisUsing expected the midpoint of company guidance for the new fiscal year, Air Products &amp; Chemicals has a forward price-earnings ratio of 27.5.This is a premium multiple to be sure, but the company has demonstrated its ability to grow over the long term, has a leadership position in what has become a very commodity-like industry and is heavily invested in growing its business. The forward multiple is not too far off the five-year average price-earnings ratio of 25.5, according to Value Line.The GF Value Line shows the stock might actually be undervalued based on its historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings estimates.Why Air Products &amp; Chemicals Isn't Done Going HigherAir Products &amp; Chemicals has a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.89, which implies a potential return of 12.2% from current levels. Add in the 2.1% dividend yield and total returns could begin to approach the mid-teens. GuruFocus rates the stock as modestly undervalued.Final thoughtsAir Products &amp; Chemicals has bucked the downward trend this year for both the market and its sector due to the strength of its business model and results. The company raised prices in all of its markets and did not see a decline in demand. In fact, volume improved by at least a low double-digit percentage in its two largest markets. Further investment in its business should help double-digit earnings growth continue, much as it has over the last decade.Even with these benefits, shares trade just slightly above their medium-term average valuation. On an intrinsic value basis, the stock could provide returns in the low double-digit range, suggesting it is not ready to cool off even as it has recently established a new high. For investors looking for a name that has proven to work even when markets decline, Air Products &amp; Chemicals could make a good candidate.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

It is the first time that the UAW union is organizing a major EV battery plant for a Detroit automaker. This will set a precedent for similar multibillion-dollar facilities to spring up.Expectations are rife that the Ultium Cells workers will vote in support of the UAW’s representation, with President Joe Biden being a strong ally of the union and supporting its decision to bolster its current membership and setting up EV startups.The organizing vote began on Dec 7 and will end on the night of Dec 8. Nearly 900 workers are participating in the voting. Upon completion, the paper ballots will be mixed and counted immediately, according to the United States Labor Relations Board, which is overseeing the process. Per the board’s rules, both sides have five business days to submit objections to challenge the results. Following that period, the sides can begin talks.The organizing vote comes after Ultium denied access to organize workers despite the support from GM CEO, Mary Barra, for the right for employees to unionize. Barra and other executives have acknowledged that hourly pay for factory workers at the battery plants should be closer to that of auto supplier workers, which is about $20 or less, rather than traditional assembly line jobs that top out at more than $30 an hour.Ultium has said that hourly workers currently make between $16 and $22 an hour with full benefits, incentives and tuition assistance. In August this year, 85% of Ultium Cells workers signed union authorization cards. Of the workers, 94% have voted to strike in case General Motors does not recognize them as a union. The Ultium plant in Ohio is the first of at least four U.S. battery facilities for the GM-LG joint venture. The plants are expected to employ thousands of workers in the coming years.Electric vehicles are believed to usher in a new era of American manufacturing jobs for the UAW. But, at the same time, EV adoption implies reduced jobs and undermines President Biden’s goal of creating 1 million new jobs in the U.S. auto industry. EVs require far fewer parts than vehicles with internal combustion engines, which potentially hurt factory assembly jobs. A 2018 study by the union found that mass adoption of EVs could cost the UAW 35,000 jobs. However, it expects the number to have declined now. A number of EV parts are produced outside the United States, as well as vehicle assembly, where workers are paid significantly lower wages.Factoring in the concerns, the UAW has taken a cautious stance toward EVs that seeks to ensure that the transition is equitable to American workers and does not cost a great number of jobs. Joint venture battery facilities are crucial for the UAW to grow and add members as top automakers such as GM transition to electric vehicles. The UAW’s push into the battery plants has included several industry biggies but the groundwork is not easy.The UAW’s total membership of more than 400,000 has grown during the past decade as it diversified its membership, but the figure remains far below its peak of 1.5 million in the late 1970s.Despite the challenges it has to face, the union’s tireless efforts in giving workers, especially those working at startups, a chance to get represented and voice their opinion throw a glimmer of hope that the need to have fewer workers will be offset to an extent in the race for EV adoption.Shares of GM have lost 36.3% over a year compared with the industry’s 48.4% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are some better-ranked players in the auto space – CarParts.com PRTS, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN and Genuine Parts Company GPC, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

""It's absolutely very, very critical, and they've done it at the right time.""According to a new study by Kantar Research, about 1 in 4 current Disney+ subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version — translating to roughly 46 million of the streamer's total 164 million user base.Industry experts argue offering lower-cost, ad-supported options are still an important hedge against churn — something all streamers want to avoid amid increased competition.On Tuesday, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos teased there could be more ad-supported offerings for the leading streaming service, telling investors at a UBS conference: ""We have multiple tiers today. So it's likely there will be multiple ad tiers over time, but nothing to talk about yet.""The executive added Netflix's ad tier is likely to change and develop over time, explaining: ""The product itself will evolve. I suspect pretty dramatically, but slowly and gradually.""Netflix's ad tier, competitively priced at $6.99 a month, comes with a few downsides like the inability to download movies and TV shows. Additionally, due to various licensing restrictions across countries, about 10% of overall content is not available for users in the ad tier.Story continues""Nearly about 90% of watching is covered in the ad tier today,"" Sarandos revealed during Tuesday's conference, explaining that number should slowly tick higher. ""You should expect — [not] complete parity, but near parity over time.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Iger's shift toward profitabilityAs Disney looks to leverage its ad tier, recently returned CEO Bob Iger hopes the debut can help soften unfavorable investor sentiment, as Disney shares are off more than 40% since the start of the year.In its most recent fiscal year, losses for Disney's direct-to-consumer unit, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, totaled $4 billion for the year.The streaming division lost a combined $1.5 billion in the company's latest quarter, missing expectations and sending shares down more than 10% following the results.Iger, who spoke to employees at a company-wide town hall last week, noted a strategic shift towards profits is currently underway, revealing there are currently no plans to reverse the hiring freeze implemented by Bob Chapek earlier this month as he continues to evaluate Disney's current cost structure.Executive Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger arrives at the world premiere for the film 'The King's Man' at Leicester Square in London, Britain December 6, 2021.

Just a little taste-- phenomenal, visual masterpiece, mind blowing. There seems to be a lot of confidence in James Cameron, which was largely expected. And for Cameron, too, it's been reported that this film has to land in the top four or five movies of all time, just to break even. So I'm sure he wants to see that enthusiasm. Theaters as well, ticket sales are down about 30% compared to 2019. So if ""Avatar 2"" can add to that momentum into 2023, that's a great thing for them.There are some downside risks here, one being the fact, 3D, I'm not sure if people really are into 3D as much as they were 13 years ago once the original film debuted. That's also another risk. Are people still connected to these characters? But considering how well the re-release did, I think we're going to have a slam dunk.DAVE BRIGGS: Surprised they pulled it.

Disney’s direct-to-consumer division suffered in particular, posting a $1.5 billion loss even as subscription numbers increased. Iger has made increasing profit margins for Disney+ a priority, arguing that the company should cut its production cost.The cost of Disney+’s ad-supported tier subscription is in line with most other streaming services, such as HBOMax, Peacock, and Netflix, which all offer streaming plans with ads for under $10 a month.

According to CEO Ted Sarandos, multiple new payment tiers are in development, as the company aims to boost revenue amid increased competition. Currently, Netflix charges $6.99 for a basic plan with ads and $9.99 for an ad-free plan. There are also more expensive plans with an option for simultaneous streaming on multiple devices.As monthly fees fluctuate, Netflix is hoping its continued investment in premium content will keep its subscriber base stable, as well as spur new subscribers in developing markets globally. Season four of the 80s-themed Stranger Things became the second Netflix show to pass one billion hours streamed, and the platform has also found recent success with surprise-hit Wednesday, a spin-off of the Addams Family, which is on track to become the third-most streamed series in Netflix history. Additionally, the company hopes to build on the buzz with the much-anticipated Harry &amp; Meghan, a 6-part docu-series about the couple produced by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex themselves that premieres on Thursday (Dec. 8).Despite a recent stumble in earnings, Netflix has consistently been the most profitable streaming service. After posting subscriber losses in the first half of 2022, the company was still able to beat revenue expectations.Now that streaming services have become a permanent fixture in the homes of millions of Americans, the question of profitability will take center stage. This likely means price hikes across the industry, more ads, less money spent on original programming, and, for its competitors, trying to catch up to Netflix.

And Netflix's co-CEO also touting more plans for ads. Well, for more on this new trend, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. So, no more freebies.ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's right, Rachelle. A lot happening in the streaming space, specifically when we talk about ad-supported. Disney's ad-free tier is going to officially launch tomorrow on Thursday at a price point of $7.99. That means that Disney's original plan without ads, that's going to cost 3 bucks more, $10.99. And according to a new study from Kantar Research, about one in four Disney+ subscribers will trade down to that ad-supported tier. So that translates to roughly 46 million out of the total subscriber base for Disney+, which is 164 million.Now, of course, this ad tier comes just one month after Netflix's own ad-supported version. The Netflix ad tier costing $6.99, so $1 less than Disney's and pretty competitively priced when we look at the streaming landscape, specifically those ad tiers. And like you said, we did hear from Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos yesterday speaking at a UBS conference. And he said just like Netflix has multiple premium tiers, you can expect to see multiple ad tiers over time. So that's something to keep an eye on.I will say that there are a few downsides if you subscribe to the ad tier. For example, you cannot download certain shows or movies due to technical complexities surrounding the ads. In addition, some programming is not available through this ad tier. Sarandos says, currently, about 90% of content is available. He's hoping to up that number over time. And that's due to a variety of restrictions that Netflix is still figuring out.But overall, really interesting to see Netflix doubling down on ads, considering out of all the streaming giants, they were the ones that were the most resistant and the most hesitant.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Allie, can we talk about ""Wednesday""? I mean, I'm going to say that this is a Netflix show that I saw the trailer, and I just said, no, pass. I'm not going to watch this. And now it is one of the all-time most popular shows.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I agree, Akiko, and I think a big part of this is word of mouth. If you just look at the numbers here, for the week of November 28, the show racked up over 411 million viewing hours. That brings its grand total to 752.52 million hours viewed. That's according to Netflix.And it makes this series the third most popular English language show of all time, right behind ""Stranger Things, Season 4"" and ""Monster,"" the Jeffrey Dahmer story. Many believe that this will inch into that number two spot and defeat Dahmer, given where things are currently trending. Of course, the number one show of all time on Netflix is still ""Squid Game,"" so I'm not quite sure that ""Wednesday"" will rack up the numbers to beat that one. But still, it's so impressive.And if you look at some of the original programming that Netflix has released this quarter, it's not just ""Dahmer"" and ""Wednesday,"" but also ""The Watcher"" has been really successful. On December 28, we'll see that ""Glass Onion,"" ""Knives Out"" sequel. So it's going to be interesting to track that and see how that translates to the fourth quarter earnings that we'll get in 2023.]"

HP has lost 9.2% since its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings announcement on Nov 16. The negative response could be attributed to a lack of positive surprise on the earnings front.What Did Helmerich &amp; Payne’s Earnings Unveil?Helmerich &amp; Payne reported fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted net income of 45 cents per share, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the year-ago period, the company had incurred a loss of 62 cents per share. The numbers reflect a significant uptick in activity.Meanwhile, operating revenues of $631.3 million topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $597 million and increased 83.6% from the year-ago level on strong results from the key North America Solutions segment. Precisely, sales from the unit totaled $552.3 million, well ahead of the consensus mark of $509 million.Segment PerformanceNorth America Solutions: During the quarter, operating revenues of $552.3 million were up 88.3% year over year on higher activity levels, with the average number of active rigs rising from 124 to 176. The steep uptick in drilling works on the back of robust oil and gas prices, together with pricing improvements, meant that the segment turned around from the previous year’s operating loss of $60.7 million to a profit of $92.1 million.Offshore Gulf of Mexico: Revenues of $34.3 million increased 8.9% from the year-ago quarter as activity remained robust. Moreover, margins during the July-September period of 2022 expanded 22.3% year over year, resulting in the segment’s operating profit surged 45.3% from the prior-year period to $9.4 million.International Solutions: The segment’s operations generated revenues of $42.4 million, up from $17.3 million in the corresponding period of 2021 — again due to improved activity levels (primarily in Latin America), with the average number of active rigs jumping 83.3% from 6 to 11. The unit reported a loss of $789,000, significantly narrower than the loss of $5.7 million incurred in the corresponding period a year ago. Apart from increased drilling, the International Solutions segment benefited from lower selling, general and administrative expenses.Story continuesFinancial PositionIn the reported quarter, Helmerich &amp; Payne spent $75.9 million on capital programs. As of Sep 30, 2022, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company had $232.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, while long-term debt was $542.6 million (debt-to-capitalization of 16.4%).GuidanceThis Tulsa, OK-based company anticipates operating gross margins in the North America Solutions segment between $250 million and $270 million in the fiscal first quarter. It sees around 181-186 contracted rigs by Dec 31, 2022.  Coming to the Offshore Gulf of Mexico segment, Helmerich &amp; Payne envisions operating gross margins within $8-$10 million for the fiscal first quarter.Additionally, International Solutions operating gross margins are forecast between $7-$10 million for the current quarter.For the current fiscal year, Helmerich &amp; Payne still estimates capital outlay within $425-$475 million, while it hopes to shell out some $400 million as depreciation and $195 million in the form of general and administrative expenses.Other Energy PicksApart from Helmerich &amp; Payne, investors interested in the energy space might look at Nine Energy Service NINE, Patterson-UTI Energy PTEN and Halliburton HAL, each carrying a Zacks Rank #1, currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nine Energy Service: Nine Energy Service is valued at some $300.7 million.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Colgate-Palmolive's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Colgate-Palmolive.Is There Enough Growth For Colgate-Palmolive?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Colgate-Palmolive's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 27%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 15% in total over the last three years. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 17% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Colgate-Palmolive's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.We've established that Colgate-Palmolive maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.You always need to take note of risks, for example - Colgate-Palmolive has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of Colgate-Palmolive's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

290,ef957ba2-06af-3962-af86-d9ae794856db,CMCSA,2022-12-08,Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after Comcast Corporation's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) latest 5.5% drop adds to a year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-adopt-severe-110107456.html,1670497267,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$150b last week after a 5.5% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 27% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Comcast which might hurt individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Comcast, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Comcast. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Comcast's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Comcast is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 9.2% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.3% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Brian Roberts, the CEO has 0.8% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of ComcastWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Comcast Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.3b worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Comcast. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Comcast better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Comcast  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

By 2030, an estimated 9 out of 10 jobs will require digital skills - but nearly one-third of U.S. workers lack these skills. If current trends continue, people of color could be under- or unprepared for up to 90 percent of all jobs by 2045.At Comcast, we see these challenges and know we are uniquely positioned to help solve them. One of the most effective ways we're doing so is through direct involvement and investment in local communities and partners nationwide who are on the frontlines of change. When it comes to closing the digital divide, digital navigators are among the most essential change agents.Digital navigators help community members understand how important digital skills are, and how to access available resources. They are the local voices community members know and trust most.What is a Digital Navigator?A Digital Navigator helps people get online and make the most of it.They can help someone:Sign up for Internet serviceGet a deviceConnect to skills training and other resourcesDigital Navigators are part of community-based organizations. They're a trusted voice for those who don't know where to start. They help open the door to opportunity and economic mobility.Of people who've received help from Digital Navigators:1 in 3 found a new job or increased their income40% received support with basic needs like food, rent, and housingA recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study found that when individuals worked with digital navigators, more than 85 percent connected to the Internet at home more frequently, and 1 in 3 found a new job or secured a higher income. Nearly three quarters (72 percent) of Black and Hispanic individuals surveyed obtained Internet access or a home computer or tablet with the help of a digital navigator. Nearly half of all those surveyed obtained better healthcare and 40 percent were able to access support for basic needs like food, rent, and housing because of their work with digital navigators. Quite simply, digital navigators help change lives.Story continuesThat's why they are an essential part of Project UP, our 10-year, $1 billion pledge to advance digital equity through programs and community partnerships that connect people to the Internet, advance economic mobility, and open doors for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, storytellers and creators.Although proven effective at helping to remove adoption barriers and advance trust, digital navigator programs often remain underfunded. Through Project UP, we're intentionally investing directly in community-based initiatives and programs to broaden the scope of digital equity organizations in communities by training and deploying more digital navigators in cities and states across the country.Earlier this month, I traveled to Massachusetts to announce our latest investment of $500,000 in 17 organizations supporting digital access and adoption for residents across the Greater Boston region. Among the grant recipients are Central Boston Elder Services, which provides services to elderly and disabled people and caregivers; One Bead, an organization dedicated to closing the opportunity group through high-impact entrepreneurial programming for students; and Tech Goes Home, whose work brings computers, internet, and training to families and individuals throughout Massachusetts.Tech Goes Home has a team of more than 300 active instructors supporting community members, or learners, in understanding the importance of digital skills and how to access available resources. Together, they've helped thousands of people in the Boston area get connected.Yoscairy Raymond, one of Tech Goes Home's digital navigators, shared with us the difference their work is making in the community.""It's really great to connect the families that we work with in the community. A lot of the families don't have that access to the internet or that access to computers. Being able to bridge that gap and see the smiles on their faces when they can do a PowerPoint or send an email ─ it's been really rewarding. Seeing how that has actually opened opportunities for them to get jobs, apply for apartments or even other government assistance has been so rewarding. To think that this one small step, maybe to some people, is actually a huge open door for a lot of our families.""As we made these latest grant announcements, surrounded by local leaders who are doing the important work of helping to improve access and opportunity in their communities, I was filled with great optimism for what lies ahead ─ for the countless tangible ways we will help change lives by investing in and working with our digital navigation partners. Story by story, community by community, we are laying the foundation for an incredible future of unlimited possibilities.Dalila Wilson-Scott is Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer for Comcast Corporation and President of the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: http://www.comcastcorporation.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/730717/Digital-Navigators-Keys-to-Getting-Our-Communities-Digitally-Connected]"

You really can’t be blamed for not being in the Christmas spirit this year. The stock market’s challenging 2022 took a toll on a lot of portfolios, leaving many investors feeling more like a Grinch than looking for new stocks to buy.But there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon – think of it as Rudolph’s red nose, lighting the way for Santa to bring some better tidings for the holiday season.After all, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has nearly clawed its way back to the black. It’s down only 5% on the year now, after spending much of 2022 flirting with bear territory. That’s progress.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd if you look toward the future you can see a chance for greater profits. After a weak year, many stocks are discounted heavily right now. Others – particularly energy stocks – are flying high and still have a long runway to bring in exaggerated returns.So, grab some egg nog, pull your chair up to the fire and take a look at some Christmas stocks to buy.

Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is benefiting from higher energy costs brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty for oil and natural gas production.OXY stock is up a whopping 137% in 2022 and shows zero signs of slowing down, making it one of the Christmas stocks to buy for continued growth. The consensus price target of $77.50 indicates that Occidental has at least another 12% runway.The company did have a minor misstep in its last earnings report, missing analysts’ estimates on earnings per share by 2 cents. The company topped revenue estimates handily, bringing in $9.5 billion versus expectations of $9.05 billion. But EPS was $2.44 when the Street expected $2.46.Story continuesThat wasn’t enough to damage Occidental’s grade in the Portfolio Grader – my free tool that measures stocks by quantitative factors plus momentum, analyst sentiments, earnings performance and other factors and assigns a letter grade.

And that includes a 16% hike in just the last three months.Citi analyst Alastair Syme raised the firm’s price target on XOM stock recently from $98 to $110, saying that even though energy stocks are at or near all-time highs, energy stocks still have room to run.Exxon is working to keep the profits coming by reducing operating costs and then passing the savings on to investors via stock buybacks and dividends, making it one of the best dividend Christmas stocks to buy.

DVN may not be as well-known. But it’s been a solid winner so far this year and there’s every reason to believe that will continue.The Oklahoma-based oil and natural gas exploration company is up 55% so far this year. While oil and natural gas aren’t expected to return to their 2022 highs, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says prices will still be above levels seen in the late 2010s and early 2020s.That will keep the dollars rolling in for Devon, which brought in $5.43 billion in revenue and $2.18 EPS in the third quarter. Analysts were expecting $4.79 billion in revenue of and EPS of $2.13.On top of that, DVN provides an amazing dividend yield of 8%, giving investors yet another reason to buy and hold.

But it’s still one of the best dividend Christmas stocks you can buy. In fact, I recently identified Amgen as one of my best dividend stocks to buy for 2023.The biotech company is a leader in providing treatment for some well-known and debilitating ailments, including bone cancer, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. As long as it keeps that pipeline of medications rolling in through its R&amp;D, Amgen stock will be a winner.In September, it announced updated long-term positive data about the effectiveness of its Repatha drug that treats high cholesterol.Q3 earnings included revenue of $6.65 billion and EPS of $4.70, both better than expectations of $6.55 billion and $4.45 EPS.

PBR stockSource: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.comBrazil-based Petroleo Brasileiro (NYSE:PBR) is in a unique spot.

His representatives also reportedly have asked Petrobras to suspend the planned sale of its Manaus refinery.Shares are down by 12% in the last month, bringing the company’s year-to-date return to less than 3%. But that also means that PBR stock is significantly discounted and is in a prime position to provide some outsized returns next year.Make no mistake – there’s a lot of money to be had with PBR. The company brought in $170 billion in revenue in the third quarter, beating expectations of $162.08 billion.

Financial terms of the deal were not yet disclosed. Russia generated approximately $85 million in net sales in the first nine months of 2022.This along, Owens Corning has reaffirmed its fourth-quarter 2022 guidance. For the fourth quarter, the company expects a moderate end market with the changing macroeconomic environment. For the quarter, it expects net sales and adjusted EBIT to grow modestly year over year.Chair and chief executive officer of OC, Brian Chambers, stated, “This announcement represents the final step in our process to fully exit our operations in Russia.”Focus on Inorganic MovesIn order to position its business well among its peers and reduce uncertainty, OC has undertaken various inorganic moves. On Sep 13, it entered into an agreement to sell the Russian operations to forgo the uncertain impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on business. The Russian operations and associated assets represent approximately 1% of annual consolidated net sales and consolidated assets, respectively.Earlier in July, it concluded the sale of the European portion of the dry-use chopped strands (""DUCS"") product line, located in Chambéry, France, within the Composites’ segment.Apart from the planned divestures, acquisitions are an important part of Owens Corning’s growth strategy. The company is assessing its investment in bolt-on acquisitions that leverage its commercial, operational and geographic strength and expand its functional areas of offering. So far in 2022, the company has acquired five businesses.Lately, on Sep 1, it acquired the remaining 50% interest in its joint venture company — Fiberteq, LLC.

And, of course, they get their hands on extra talent that allows them to spur innovation and future growth.Several companies – Microsoft MSFT, Oracle ORCL, and Adobe Inc. ADBE – have all been on the offensive in 2022, unveiling acquisition news. Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each acquisition.Microsoft Acquires Activision BlizzardIn January 2022, Microsoft made a significant splash, shaking the gaming world to its core by acquiring Activision Blizzard ATVI for a whopping $68.7 billion. It was a massive deal that caught extensive attention, as it ranks as the largest acquisition in the video game industry’s history.Activision Blizzard is a leader in video game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher, most well-known for Call of Duty. MSFT already owns two massive video game titles, Halo – the company’s flagship video game, and Minecraft – the best-selling game of all time.Microsoft intends to publish all of ATVI’s hit video game titles onto its Xbox Game Pass; this unique gaming service allows gamers unlimited access to a library of games for a flat monthly rate.Microsoft shares currently trade at a 25.5X forward earnings multiple, off its 28.5X five-year median and above its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 22.3X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobe Acquires FigmaIn September 2022, Adobe went on the offensive, announcing its acquisition of Figma for roughly $20 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.A privately-held company, Figma is a web-first collaborative design platform structured to aid teams who build products together. The company has made the design process faster and more enjoyable, all while increasing efficiency.Story continuesThe combined company has a sizable, quickly-growing market opportunity projected to deliver substantial value for customers, shareholders, and the entire industry.Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe, said, “The combination of Adobe and Figma is transformational and will accelerate our vision for collaborative creativity.”On a relative basis, ADBE shares are cheap; the company’s 27.1X forward earnings multiple is a fraction of its 44.8X five-year median and well off 2021 highs of 65.5X.Still, the value undoubtedly remains on the higher end of the spectrum, typical of stocks with a high-growth nature.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOracle Acquires Adi InsightsIn May 2022, Oracle unveiled its announcement regarding its acquisition of Adi Insights, a top provider of workforce management solutions.Regarding the deal’s benefits, Adi Insights brings overtime management, time capture, demand forecasting, and shift scheduling to SuitePeople (NetSuite’s human resource program). It’s worth noting that Oracle leads NetSuite.Currently, ORCL shares trade at a 19.2X forward earnings multiple, above the 16.5X five-year median but below the Zacks sector average of 22.3X by a fair margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, for those who have an appetite for income, ORCL has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 1.6%, well above that of its Zacks sector average.Oracle has also been growing its dividend, upping its payout two times over the last five years, translating to an impressive 14.1% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineComing out of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic has indeed landed us in a unique economic environment in 2022, to say the least.A hawkish Federal Reserve, lingering COVID-19 uncertainties, and geopolitical issues have all been thorns in the side of the market.Still, amid all of the gloom and doom, there have been several notable acquisition announcements coming from sizable tech companies, including Microsoft MSFT, Oracle ORCL, and Adobe Inc.

The Wall Street Journal reporting that security concerns are holding up negotiations. We spoke with Senator Mark Warner recently, who has been spoken-- really speaking out about security risks he feels the app poses. Here's what he told us.MARK WARNER: If, at the end of the day, if the Communist Party and President Xi can dial up or dial down the content that your kids may be seeing, that would worry me.DAVE BRIGGS: It does, indeed. Yahoo Finance tech reporter Allie Garfinkle here with more on this. Allie, nice to see you. How is TikTok responding to all of this?ALLIE GARFINKLE: Great to see you, Dave. So, from TikTok's end, what they're saying is that they're in a holding pattern right now. These concerns, the stalling, it's not the first time we've seen these talks stall. And in this case, it is for national security concerns, right? The government is worried that they can't necessarily trust TikTok to agree to the terms of the deal, if they can complete it fully. They're also worried about how the company uses data in its recommendations algorithm.Now, for TikTok's part, right, what are they saying? They're essentially saying the government hasn't come back with new demands as to how they might go about addressing some of those security concerns. So from TikTok's end, what essentially they've said, actually, is that they're waiting for an update.There is some stuff we do know, Dave. We do know that Oracle has stepped in to kind of agree to be TikTok's American babysitter, if you will. They've agreed to help TikTok move US user data to servers in Virginia-- not in Virginia, I'm sorry-- Oracle servers. But they are moving from data centers in Singapore and Virginia. So Oracle is kind of overseeing it. We'll see what happens. My expectation is that talks will probably begin again relatively soon.Story continuesIt should be said TikTok has 1 billion users, Dave. It is ubiquitous. I had an analyst say to me earlier this week, you cannot overcover TikTok. You cannot overstate how important it is right now.SEANA SMITH: It certainly is extremely important. Millions and millions of people are on it, like you said. FCC commissioner Brendan Carr was on our program last month, telling us that anything other than a ban would not be sufficient. What's the likelihood, do you think, of an outright ban on TikTok? Because at this point, I would argue it doesn't seem that likely.ALLIE GARFINKLE: I would agree with you, Seana, frankly. I've talked to a lot of analysts, and I have not found a single one who has said to me that they think it is likely that TikTok will be banned. It's also worth noting President Donald Trump, back in 2020, tried to ban the app and failed. So there is precedent for there being an attempted ban and a failure. And any Wall Street analyst I can talk to thinks that there will be some kind of agreement reached eventually.It's worth saying, though, if that were to happen, completely theoretically, you know, Meta and Snap would really stand to benefit, who are seen as-- who TikTok has kind of flagged as their base competitors, and vice versa. So I don't personally think it's likely. Most Wall Street analysts don't. But you're hearing a lot of rhetoric coming out of Washington that's pretty fiery.]"

312,c6d7de8c-e7b7-3523-b860-8205ec13f4fc,AON,2022-12-08,Aon's (NYSE:AON) investors will be pleased with their splendid 133% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aons-nyse-aon-investors-pleased-130019221.html,1670504419,STORY,['AON'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Aon plc (NYSE:AON) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 123% in five years. In the last week shares have slid back 1.3%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Aon There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Aon achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 36% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 17% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Aon's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Aon, it has a TSR of 133% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Aon shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.8% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, that falls short of the 18% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Aon (1 is a bit concerning)  that you should be aware of.Aon is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

313,2c25f88d-155a-3693-89a3-07743500f23d,AON,2022-12-08,Aon: Incorporating Diversity into Benefits Programs a Key Challenge - and Opportunity - for Canadian Employers,CNW Group,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aon-incorporating-diversity-benefits-programs-141500471.html,1670422500,STORY,['AON'],"[TORONTO, Dec. 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The rise of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I) as an organizational and employee priority demands that employers rethink and redefine their group benefits programs, according to a new white paper by Aon plc (NYSE: AON), a leading global professional services firm. The white paper, ""Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: A New Approach to Employee Benefits,"" argues that aligning benefits packages with DE&amp;I goals is not just a challenge: it is also a key opportunity for organizations to attract and retain high-performing employees in a competitive and increasingly diverse labour environment.""Competition for talent is greater than ever, and employers have to draw from employee pools that are different from those that have traditionally dominated the workforce,"" says Joey Raheb, chief broking officer and national leader, Growth and Client Engagement, Health Solutions, Aon in Canada. ""Applying DE&amp;I principles to employee benefits plans can not only help attract, retain and engage workers from diverse groups, but also serve as an investment in an organization's most important asset: its people.""According to Aon research, employers increasingly recognize the importance of DE&amp;I as they seek to attract and retain talent from many community types – women and visible minorities, differently abled and neurodiverse persons, historically marginalized groups and others. Many organizations are also embracing DE&amp;I as part of their environment, social and governance (ESG) goals. As a result, recognition and accommodation of diversity has become a high priority for most employers, who agree that benefits packages should reflect their DE&amp;I commitments. However, the research also shows that many HR leaders are unclear about how to begin the process of ensuring benefits strategies further their organization DE&amp;I objectives.The Aon white paper suggests that the key first step is for HR leaders to understand their organizational DE&amp;I goals and review benefits packages – as part of a total rewards strategy that integrates social and cultural determinants of health like gender, race, income, access to services and other factors. Then, a plan designed for diversity would accommodate employees from different backgrounds and with different social and health needs. It would provide options that recognize a diversity of preferences and offers flexibility for employees to personalize their benefits experience. Finally, the plan would be communicated and administered in ways that acknowledge the diverse groups it supports and their lifestyle preferences.Story continues""Every organization needs to recognize that their existing or future workplace will be unique in terms of social and cultural makeup, compensation structure and health and wellbeing goals, which means that any benefits package designed for diversity will be unique, too,"" says Raheb. ""Incorporating DE&amp;I into benefits is a process of incremental change, requiring ongoing attention and analysis to make more-informed, better decisions. But given the stakes, employers need to accept the challenge to build a more resilient workforce.""To view the full white paper, click here.About Aon Aon plc (NYSE: AON) exists to shape decisions for the better — to protect and enrich the lives of people around the world.

You can skip our detailed analysis on dividend investment and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Low-Risk Dividend Stocks to Invest In. The stock market has been rocky throughout this year, making investors anxious about the outlook of the financial situation. The S&amp;P 500 is down 17.83% year-to-date through December 7, and analysts are predicting more volatility in the upcoming months, possibly leading to a recession. In these times, investors tend to minimize risks of potential losses by prioritizing low-risk investments.Dividend investment is considered a safe option in the current economic landscape as these securities have historically outperformed the broader market with less volatility. According to a report by Fidelity, high-dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during the last two bear markets. The report also mentioned that dividends have accounted for nearly half of the total returns of the S&amp;P 500 over the past 30 years.This year’s returns have also exhibited the strong performance of dividend stocks over other asset classes. The Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index is down by just 0.95% year-to-date, which is very mild considering the broader market’s returns. Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, spoke to Barron’s in December about the overall performance of dividend stocks. He said that during periods of slow economic growth, investors load up on dividend stocks because of their defensive qualities. He further mentioned that dividend strategies are expected to outperform in 2023 as well, with high dividend growth companies stealing the limelight. Senyek named the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index one of his favorite plays, as the companies in the index are mainly known for their consistent dividend growth.Some dividend stocks that are popular amongst investors this year include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). Further in this article, we will discuss some of the best low-risk dividend stocks to invest in.Story continuesPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:We analyzed the following low-risk stocks through their business fundamentals, dividend policies, and overall financial health.

The company will give one winner the rare McGold card, giving them (and three friends, who will get cards of their own) two free McDonalds meals per week for 50 years. The McGold card has been the stuff of fast-food legend historically, with only a few people reported to have one, including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.“Our fans have been fascinated by the lore of the McGold Card and if it really exists,” McDonald's chief marketing officer Tariq Hassan said in a statement. “Now, we’ll make this McDonald’s legend a reality for our fans by giving them the ultimate holiday gift—a chance to win a card and then share access to it with three of their family or friends.”Customers who place an order via the app from Dec. 5 through Dec. 25 will receive an entry into the McGold Card sweepstakes. (Those who don’t wish to place an order can submit an entry here.)While the free food for life might be the big draw, there are plenty of other bargains available as McDonald’s looks to expand use of its app, including 50-cent double cheeseburgers, free McNuggets with a $1 purchase, and lots of buy-one-get-one-free deals. Deals will vary depending on the day of the week.And the company is jumping on board the merchandise train, offering all sorts of…unusual items. On Dec. 7, the chain will offer Chicken McNuggets stockings, McDonald’s pajamas, and hoodies. On the 14th, it will offer a Hamburglar graphic tee, more hoodies, and a beanie.Apps are becoming more important to fast-food chains, as they act as loyalty programs for the most frequent customers and keep them coming back.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

PLD is well-positioned to bank on the favorable industrial real estate market environment, backed by its solid operating platform and robust scale. The company, which has emerged as a market leader in this asset category, is witnessing the solid demand for its industrial real estate, as reflected by the leasing, rent and occupancy levels of the properties.Undoubtedly, with the e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has risen. This is aiding the industrial real estate market to prosper and benefit Prologis, Terreno Realty Corporation TRNO and Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. REXR.Resilience is essential to the future supply chain. Therefore, over the long term, apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is expected to benefit from a likely increase in inventory levels, offering possibilities to industrial landlords, including Prologis, Terreno Realty and REXR, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Prologis, in particular, has been witnessing a decent operating performance. The average occupancy level in PLD’s owned and managed portfolio was 97.7% in the third quarter.Prologis’ share of the net effective rent change reached an all-time high of 59.7% in the July-September quarter, which was led by the United States at 67%. The cash rent change was 38.5%. Also, the cash same-store net operating income touched an all-time high and grew 9.3% in the third quarter, which was led by Europe at 10.6%.With healthy operating fundamentals in industrial real estate markets, Prologis has capitalized on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. In October 2022, PLD closed the acquisition of Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $23 billion, including the assumption of debt, thereby boosting its presence in the key markets of the United States.Its high number of build-to-suit development projects highlight the advantageous location of the company’s land bank. For 2022, the company anticipates building acquisitions at Prologis’ share between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, while development starts are expected in the range of $4.2-$4.6 billion.Prologis is focused on bolstering its liquidity. This industrial REIT’s liquidity amounted to $5.3 billion in cash and availability on its credit facilities as of Sep 30, 2022. Given its balance-sheet strength and prudent financial management, PLD is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Prologis remains committed to that. In the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend five times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 11.80%.

In 2022, travelers learned how to travel again — exploring new terrain, rediscovering favorite places, and making the most of long layovers. As we end the year on a high, today Tripadvisor, the world's largest travel guidance platform, looks back over the past year, unpacking all the good that was found along the way, at the trips that were taken and all the stories and memories that were brought back.(PRNewsfoto/Tripadvisor)Despite over two years of bookmarking and saving holiday ideas, the big return was overwhelming for some - Where should I go first? What should I do next? Recent Tripadvisor research found that 'Relax and Rejuvenate' was the main trip purpose for 50% of travelers globally.

323,f3ae377c-22ef-33b3-8bd0-636bc4e48ed8,PCAR,2022-12-08,PACCAR Inc's (NASDAQ:PCAR) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-incs-nasdaq-pcar-stock-151503295.html,1670426103,STORY,['PCAR'],"[PACCAR's (NASDAQ:PCAR) stock is up by a considerable 17% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to PACCAR's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for PACCAR How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PACCAR is:20% = US$2.6b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of PACCAR's Earnings Growth And 20% ROEAt first glance, PACCAR seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Despite this, PACCAR's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesWe then compared PACCAR's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 7.3% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is PCAR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is PACCAR Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 25% (or a retention ratio of 75%), PACCAR hasn't seen much growth in its earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Additionally, PACCAR has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 40% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryIn total, it does look like PACCAR has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

(NYSE:UPS) sold US$2.5m worth of stock at an average price of US$192 a share over the past year, making the most of their investment. The company’s market cap plunged by US$8.5b after price dropped by 5.3% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United Parcel ServiceOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; Chief Marketing Officer, Kevin Warren, for US$2.5m worth of shares, at about US$192 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$175. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Kevin Warren.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does United Parcel Service Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that United Parcel Service insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$79m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The United Parcel Service Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no United Parcel Service insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Still, the insider transactions at United Parcel Service in the last 12 months are not very heartening. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with United Parcel Service (including 1 which doesn't sit too well with us).But note: United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

325,b843f726-689c-328f-82ab-b9ede8631951,AXP,2022-12-08,"With 65% institutional ownership, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/65-institutional-ownership-american-express-130052700.html,1670504452,STORY,['AXP'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 65% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of American Express, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in American Express. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of American Express, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in American Express. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 20% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.3% and 6.0% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of American Express Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$133m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in American Express. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 20% of the American Express shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with American Express .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ARHS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.51, while TSCO has a forward P/E of 22.60. We also note that ARHS has a PEG ratio of 0.81. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TSCO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.20.Another notable valuation metric for ARHS is its P/B ratio of 8.37. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSCO has a P/B of 12.36.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ARHS's Value grade of A and TSCO's Value grade of C.Story continuesARHS has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TSCO, so it seems like value investors will conclude that ARHS is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

330,30662ef0-3a13-35ff-becb-55f540fd3a3b,MDLZ,2022-12-08,What Makes Mondelez (MDLZ) a New Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-mondelez-mdlz-buy-stock-170005640.html,1670432405,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Mondelez (MDLZ) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Mondelez basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Mondelez, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for MondelezFor the fiscal year ending December 2022, this maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum is expected to earn $2.93 per share, which is a change of 2.1% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Mondelez. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.9%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Mondelez to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You really can’t be blamed for not being in the Christmas spirit this year. The stock market’s challenging 2022 took a toll on a lot of portfolios, leaving many investors feeling more like a Grinch than looking for new stocks to buy.But there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon – think of it as Rudolph’s red nose, lighting the way for Santa to bring some better tidings for the holiday season.After all, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has nearly clawed its way back to the black. It’s down only 5% on the year now, after spending much of 2022 flirting with bear territory. That’s progress.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd if you look toward the future you can see a chance for greater profits. After a weak year, many stocks are discounted heavily right now. Others – particularly energy stocks – are flying high and still have a long runway to bring in exaggerated returns.So, grab some egg nog, pull your chair up to the fire and take a look at some Christmas stocks to buy. Each of these have an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is benefiting from higher energy costs brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty for oil and natural gas production.OXY stock is up a whopping 137% in 2022 and shows zero signs of slowing down, making it one of the Christmas stocks to buy for continued growth. The consensus price target of $77.50 indicates that Occidental has at least another 12% runway.The company did have a minor misstep in its last earnings report, missing analysts’ estimates on earnings per share by 2 cents. The company topped revenue estimates handily, bringing in $9.5 billion versus expectations of $9.05 billion. But EPS was $2.44 when the Street expected $2.46.Story continuesThat wasn’t enough to damage Occidental’s grade in the Portfolio Grader – my free tool that measures stocks by quantitative factors plus momentum, analyst sentiments, earnings performance and other factors and assigns a letter grade. OXY still has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comThe sentiment that is driving OXY stock is having a similar impact on Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). The mammoth energy company (it has a market capitalization of more than $450 billion), is up 81% in 2022. And that includes a 16% hike in just the last three months.Citi analyst Alastair Syme raised the firm’s price target on XOM stock recently from $98 to $110, saying that even though energy stocks are at or near all-time highs, energy stocks still have room to run.Exxon is working to keep the profits coming by reducing operating costs and then passing the savings on to investors via stock buybacks and dividends, making it one of the best dividend Christmas stocks to buy. Third-quarter earnings were $112.07 billion, beating expectations of $104.76 billion.

DVN may not be as well-known. But it’s been a solid winner so far this year and there’s every reason to believe that will continue.The Oklahoma-based oil and natural gas exploration company is up 55% so far this year. While oil and natural gas aren’t expected to return to their 2022 highs, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says prices will still be above levels seen in the late 2010s and early 2020s.That will keep the dollars rolling in for Devon, which brought in $5.43 billion in revenue and $2.18 EPS in the third quarter. Analysts were expecting $4.79 billion in revenue of and EPS of $2.13.On top of that, DVN provides an amazing dividend yield of 8%, giving investors yet another reason to buy and hold. DVN stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Amgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) doesn’t have the mammoth dividend yield offered by Devon – it offers less than 3%. But it’s still one of the best dividend Christmas stocks you can buy. In fact, I recently identified Amgen as one of my best dividend stocks to buy for 2023.The biotech company is a leader in providing treatment for some well-known and debilitating ailments, including bone cancer, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. As long as it keeps that pipeline of medications rolling in through its R&amp;D, Amgen stock will be a winner.In September, it announced updated long-term positive data about the effectiveness of its Repatha drug that treats high cholesterol.Q3 earnings included revenue of $6.65 billion and EPS of $4.70, both better than expectations of $6.55 billion and $4.45 EPS. That helps give AMGN stock an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.T-Mobile US (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: ShutterstockI’ll be the first to confess my appreciation for 5G technology – and in turn, top 5G stocks. I think that 5G is a game-changing development because of how it will improve our everyday lives.T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock is up more than 30% so far this year and it’s beating the tar out of its biggest competitors. The company is rolling out its 5G network and growing its subscriber base – in Q3, it added 854,000 postpaid phone subscribers, beating expectations for 739,000.In comparison, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) added 8,000 in the quarter.Revenue for the third quarter was slightly less than expected — $19.48 billion versus expectations of $19.98 billion. But the earnings per share was a huge beat, coming in at $2.27 while the Street expected only EPS of 50 cents.TMUS is a stock to watch, and it has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR)Petrobras distributor in the industry and supply sector.. PBR stockSource: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.comBrazil-based Petroleo Brasileiro (NYSE:PBR) is in a unique spot. The company, known also as Petrobras, is facing some volatility because of the change in the president’s office.The Brazilian government controls Petrobras, and outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro’s business plan for Petrobras could be shuttered on Jan. 1.Incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said that Petrobras should invest beyond fossil fuels. His representatives also reportedly have asked Petrobras to suspend the planned sale of its Manaus refinery.Shares are down by 12% in the last month, bringing the company’s year-to-date return to less than 3%. But that also means that PBR stock is significantly discounted and is in a prime position to provide some outsized returns next year.Make no mistake – there’s a lot of money to be had with PBR. The company brought in $170 billion in revenue in the third quarter, beating expectations of $162.08 billion. And EPS of $3.56 was much better than expectations of $1.06 per share.PBR is an intriguing stock right now, and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAs one of the biggest and best-known defense contractors in the world, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is seeing strong returns because of continuing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, and between the U.S. and China, North Korea and Russia.Just in the last two days, LMT won a $430 million Army contract and a $139 million Missile Defense Agency contract. And when you’re a defense contractor like Lockheed Martin, with a market cap of $126 billion, the contracts are going to keep rolling in fast and furious.Lockheed Martin stock is up 36% so far this year, and it reaffirmed its outlook for the full year for revenue of $65.25 billion and EPS of $21.55.LMT provides a dividend yield of 2.5%, and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in OXY, XOM, DVN, AMGN, TMUS, PBR and LMT.

Dave?Syda Productions/Shutterstock.comDave Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance this quarter, with strong revenue growth driving operating margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. We accomplished these results because the Ulta Beauty teams continue to execute at a high level, and I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences, ensuring operational excellence, strengthening our culture and working together as one team to move our business forward as the leader in beauty. For the third quarter, net sales increased 17.2% to $2.3 billion, and comp sales increased 14.6%. Operating margin increased to 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share.Reflecting these results and our updated fourth quarter expectations, we have increased our outlook for the full year. Scott will share more details about our expectations later in the call. Our third quarter results are a testament to the resilience of the beauty category and our team's ability to drive strong guest engagement that fueled broad-based growth across our business. All major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in Prestige beauty versus the fiscal third quarter last year based on dollar sales according to point-of-sale data from the NPD Group. We delivered growth across our store and digital channels and achieved record loyalty membership of 39 million members. Additionally, we continue to see growth in per member across all income demographics.Our strategic framework, anchored by the power of our differentiated model, continues to drive our ambitions and successes as we work to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. This afternoon, I will share an update on our progress against several of our strategic pillars. Starting with our efforts to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends is delivering results. Our double-digit comp this quarter was a result of growth from our core assortment, price increases executed this year and compelling newness. Although pricing contributed more to our comp than last quarter, the majority of our third quarter comp was fueled by growth from our core assortment and newness.Historically, sales of new products have averaged 20% to 30% of our sales, and the overall mix of newness this year has been in line with our historical experience. Turning to performance by category. Skin care, fragrance and bath, hair care and makeup all delivered double-digit comp growth against the third quarter last year. From a segment perspective, we saw double-digit sales growth across both Prestige and Mass, with Mass generally outperforming Prestige. While it's hard to know with certainty if we are starting to see consumers trade down, as the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points from entry level Mass to high-end luxury and everything in between, Ulta Beauty is uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category.Turning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our fastest-growing category, skincare. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines with a focus on science-backed and dermatologist-recommended products. Guests are engaging with newer brands, like Drunk Elephant, Supergoop and Good Molecules, while new products from established brands like the Ordinary Hero Cosmetics and the Roche Posay also contributed to sales growth. To drive discovery and support guest education, this quarter, we introduced our Skincare We Love All in all stores. This curated presentation highlights exciting brands and best-selling items across key categories. The fragrance and bath category delivered another impressive quarter as Gen Z guests engaged with the category, leveraging multiple fragrances to express themselves.Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish, as well as Nescens from Burberry, Gucci and Viktor&amp;Rolf drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly fragrance crush program drove engagement with established brands including Versace and Jimmy Choo. In addition, the category benefited from strong guest engagement with our holiday fragrance gift sets, which were available earlier this year. Haircare, our second largest category, delivered solid growth, primarily driven by newness and innovation. Key category trends include hair health, damage repair and targeted treatments. Prestige brands, including Whey and Briogeo, saw strength in treatments and core assortments, while Masstige brands, including Eva Nyc, Batiste and Kristin Ess, and professional brands such as Pureology, Redken and Kenra, continued to resonate with guests.Within the category, strong hair product growth was offset by softer performance in hair tools as we lapped strong performance last year. Finally, our largest category, makeup, delivered double-digit comp growth, driven by newness and the strength of our key events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul. Growth in foundation, concealers, blush and lip continue to lead the category. New brands like Fenty, R.E.M. Beauty and NÂ°1 DE CHANEL drove sales during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, e.l.f. and NYX also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC, Chanel BeautÃ© and Bobbi Brown into more stores has continued to drive Prestige sales. Now let me give you an update on our key cross-category platforms, Conscious Beauty, Black-owned and BIPOC brands and wellness.With 290 certified brands, Conscious Beauty continues to resonate strongly with beauty enthusiasts, reflecting growing interest in products that are good for the world. This quarter, we certified 15 new brands, including NYX cosmetics, Morphe and Dime Beauty, and introduced the Conscious Beauty essentials kit, featuring minis for more than 15 brands, such as Dermalogica, Koula and our own Ulta Beauty Collection. During the quarter, we expanded our BIPOC brand assortment with four new BIPOC brands: Pebble, Bread Beauty Supply, Sugar Dough and Undefined Beauty. As another way we look to create foundational industry change, we proudly launched our MES Accelerator program to support early-stage BIPOC brands as they prepare for retail readiness.Our inaugural class included eight BIPOC founders, with innovative brands across skin care, makeup, fragrance, haircare and wellness. In addition to financial support, each MUSE Accelerator participant took part in an intensive 10-week training program, learning from Ulta Beauty leaders, industry subject matter experts and leading BIPOC brand owners. We are honored and excited to be a part of their journey as they build their business and expand their reach. Finally, we continue to increase our presence in wellness. During the quarter, we further enhanced our assortment to reflect our guest evolving needs. And in September, we expanded our offering to include intimate wellness as the sixth online-only pillar of the wellness shop. While wellness represents a small part of our overall business today, we believe it is a significant longer-term growth opportunity given the incrementality of the purchase and the strong emotional connection consumers have with self-care.Turning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends accelerated this quarter and exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, representing an important milestone in our COVID recovery. In addition to strong sales growth from stores, we continue to deliver growth in e-commerce, further reinforcing the incrementality of this important channel. The convenience of BOPIS for e-commerce orders continues to resonate with guests. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 18% to 23% of e-commerce sales, compared to 20% last year. Our services business accelerated and delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to higher stylist retention, increased stylist productivity and increased capacity in our salons as we lap capacity constraints due to the pandemic.Our targeted CRM efforts to drive awareness, trial and frequency are working, delivering increases in salon appointments from both existing and new members. Additionally, our in-store back bar events continued to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands. As industry leaders, we're always working to enhance guest experiences across all of our platforms. During the quarter, we introduced a new layout in about a dozen stores to showcase our categories better, improve navigation, enhance the services experience and create more opportunities for discovery. The most noticeable changes include the repositioning of skincare, an important growth category to the front of the store. All products grew by category with delineated fixtures and visuals and a flow from Prestige to Masstige to Mass.Elevated Gondolas that showcased key iconic and service brands, new beauty bars that offer our brow and makeup services, as well as supporting in-store events, dedicated space in the front of the store to feature brand and product launches across categories, and a relocated checkout closer to the salon. We are excited to introduce this new store layout to guest. And as we've done in the past, we intend to introduce this new experience in new stores, remodels and relocations. At this time, we have no plans to retrofit existing stores. Stores are a critical part of our ecosystem. And while most Ulta Beauty's transactions occur in stores, we know the guest journey often begins online. To assist guests along their journey, we offer a suite of virtual digital tools, including Glam Lab, Skin Advisor and our hairstyle tool, among others.The latest addition is a fragrance finder designed to help guests explore fragrances by favorite brand or ingredient, launched just in time for the holiday season. Finally, we continue to be excited about the long-term opportunity with our strategic Target partnership. This touch point enables us to connect and reconnect with members. And while the partnership isn't material yet to our overall member growth, it has contributed positively. Importantly, we are seeing members bounce back to Ulta Beauty after becoming an active member, while at the Ulta Beauty at target shop. Now, let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty, and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. Recognizing the beauty is personal. We are on a multiyear journey to create stronger, more emotional connections with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life.Launched in September, our latest brand building campaign Beauty&amp; is rooted in insights from cultural leaders and beauty enthusiasts. The creative content on owned and paid channels has driven broad improvement in top-of-mind awareness and is resonating with our guests, particularly Black and Latinx beauty enthusiasts. Turning to our loyalty program. Our efforts to nurture loyalty in personalized ways is driving member growth and delivering incremental value. We ended the quarter with 39 million active members, 9% higher than the third quarter last year. Overall spend per member increased driven by increased frequency and higher average ticket. While price increases are having an impact, we are encouraged to see unit growth per member. Our loyalty program is a strategic asset and an important driver of our long-term growth.We prioritize member engagement, loyalty and retention across every Ulta Beauty touch point. The growth and strength of our loyalty program starts with ensuring that our existing guests stay engaged. Nurturing our existing members through our Member Love events and life cycle marketing strategies has enabled us to maintain healthy retention rates, which have contributed to member growth and higher spend per member. Member reactivation remains a priority, and we are leveraging CRM tools to personalize offers and reengage members in more targeted ways. And, of course, conversion of new members also contributes to overall member growth, and we continue to acquire new members in our stores, digital platforms and through our partnership with Target.Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday season is in full flow, and our teams are executing well. While predicting holiday shopping patterns this year is challenging, I am optimistic about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty this holiday season. Our engaging holiday messaging, one-of-a-kind assortment, with exceptional seasonal options and diverse touch points, all paired with our team's unrelenting passion for delivering great guest experiences, position us well to deliver another successful holiday season. Grounded in robust consumer insights, our holiday marketing strategy positions Ulta Beauty as the place for gifting, glamming and self-care this season. Our intent is to empower guests to celebrate the season however they want.And our integrated media plan for the holiday aims to build broad awareness of Ulta Beauty as a holiday destination, spark connection with key audiences, leverage our beauty expertise and drive consideration and purchase. Our merchandising team has built an outstanding holiday gifting assortment, whether guests want to get others or treat themselves, we have thoughtfully curated options across every category and budget, with a balanced approach to the mix of seasonal holiday items and core items that make great guests. We entered the holiday season with well-staffed stores in DCs, and our teams are excited, engaged and ready. For the first time since 2019, our store teams gathered in person to review our holiday strategies. And I know their excitement and enthusiasm for our plans will be felt in every guest interaction.And our corporate and DC teams have worked cross-functionally to ensure Ulta Beauty is positioned to deliver for our store teams and our guests. In closing, I am incredibly proud of our year-to-date results, and I'm excited about our holiday plans. Even as consumers continue to navigate economic headwinds, we believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident that our differentiated model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates, will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?See also 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks Under $10 and 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now.Scott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported results that were better than our initial expectations. Strong double-digit revenue growth resulted in record-setting third quarter operating margin performance. These excellent results reflect the continued focus and hard work of our store, DC and corporate teams. And I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for working together to deliver another outstanding quarter for our shareholders. Now to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 17.2%, driven by comp sales growth of 14.6% and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $20 million, primarily due to credit card income growth, higher loyalty point redemptions and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target.Breaking down the comp performance further, comp transactions for the quarter increased 10.7%, primarily driven by strong growth from in-store transactions. Average ticket increased 3.5% due to an increase in average selling price, partially offset by slightly lower average units per transaction. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. While average units per transaction was slightly lower than last year, the total number of units sold increased about 10% on a comp basis. During the quarter, we opened 18 new stores, relocated one store and remodeled eight stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 160 basis points to 41.2% of sales compared to 39.6% last year.The increase was primarily due to the leverage of store fixed costs, other revenue growth and higher merchandise margin, partially offset by higher inventory shrink. Robust top line growth and benefits from our ongoing occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in healthy leverage of store fixed costs. The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily due to benefits resulting from the timing of retail price changes, partially offset by brand mix. As we have discussed, we have executed a number of price increases from our brand partners this year. Generally, when the new price is effective at the shelf, we are still selling the inventory purchased at the lower cost. As a result, there's a short-term benefit to cost of goods as we move through the lower cost inventory.As expected, our promotional activity increased from the second quarter, but the impact to margin was not meaningful compared to last year. SG&amp;A increased 18.6% to $597.2 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A increased 30 basis points to 25.5% compared to 25.2% last year, primarily due to increases in store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Store payroll and benefits deleverage this quarter primarily due to increased labor hours to maintain service standards, higher average wage rates to support recruitment and retention and a timing shift of incentive compensation accruals. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities including Project SOAR and other IT capabilities, UB Media and Ulta Beauty at Target.These headwinds were partially offset by lower marketing expense. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners, with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. Similar to what we saw in the first half, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&amp;A in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter increased 27.3% to $361.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 130 basis points to 15.5% of sales compared to 14.2% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share compared to $3.94 per share last year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow.Total inventory increased 10.3%. In addition to the impact of 41 additional stores, the increase reflects purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs, as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stock to support expected demand. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $83.5 million compared to $51.1 million last year. The increase was primarily related to investments in new remodeled and relocated stores, IT projects and merchandising improvements. Depreciation was $58.5 million compared to $65.2 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $250.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 340,000 shares at a cost of $137.5 million.At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. Turning now to our outlook. We have raised our financial guidance for fiscal 2022 to reflect our strong third quarter performance and increased expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $9.95 billion and $10 billion, with comp sales growth between 12.6% and 13.2%. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 6% and 8%, up from our previous expectation for low single-digit increase. Sales growth moderated in November as we lapped last year's strong performance, but we are pleased with the sales trends we saw through the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, including Cyber Monday.We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season, and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Our Q4 comp outlook, reflects both the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from shifts in consumer spending, increased points of distribution for Prestige beauty and higher promotional activity. For the year, we plan to open approximately 47 net new stores and remodel or relocate 33 stores. Our new store performance continues to be strong. But like many other major retailers, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues, as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. These external factors have impacted our fiscal 2022 plans and will likely shift new stores originally planned for fiscal 2023 into 2024.We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next two years, but the timing of opening between fiscal 2023 and 2024 may shift as we navigate these external challenges. The operating environment is fluid, and we will provide specific targets for fiscal 2023 when we report in March. We now expect operating margins for the year will be between 15.5% and 15.6% of sales. We expect gross margin for the year will increase with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs. We continue to expect SG&amp;A expense for the year will increase between 15% and 16% and or approximately flat as a percentage of sales, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense.Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $22.60 and $22.90. One final update. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $160 million for supply chain and IT, $140 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $30 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million. While we are not providing guidance for next year on this call, we want to share some high-level thoughts for your consideration as you model fiscal 2023. The beauty category has been stronger this year than expected. Barring a major economic event, we would expect category growth to continue in 2023, albeit at lower rates, reflecting strong consumer engagement with the category, and we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2023 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%.In this sales scenario, we would expect operating margin deleverage versus our fiscal 2022 guidance. In addition to inflationary pressures on wage rates and other operational expenses, we expect to increase investment spending related to our strategic priorities, reflecting timing shifts from fiscal 2022 and the planned ramp-up of key IT and supply chain investments. Finally, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year for Ulta Beauty. We are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2023 and plan to provide specific financial guidance, and update our longer-term growth targets, if appropriate, on our March earnings call. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&amp;A session.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Well, the month of December has been a favorable one for investors as stocks tend to gain momentum just before the curtains draw on a year. But for now, market pundits are keeping their fingers crossed as 2022 has not been benevolent enough toward investors.Investors seem to be nervous and are treading Wall Street with utmost caution as worries about a possible recession loom large. Experts fear that the Fed’s hawkish stance to tame inflation might push the economy into a recession.However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent comment about lowering the magnitude of the rate hike from December has come as a breather. Meanwhile, a favorable reading on the Consumer Price Index front as well as a better-than-expected jobs report in November have added to the positive sentiment. Nonfarm payrolls climbed 263,000 last month. Also, average hourly earnings rose 5.1% from a year ago and 0.6% on a month-on-month basis.Such favorable economic data might bring the mojo back on Wall Street and rekindle hopes of a Santa Claus rally this year. Well, the S&amp;P 500 index is down 17.3% so far in the year. Truly speaking, soaring inflation, higher cost of borrowings and geopolitical headwinds have kept investors on their toes.So, as you reassess your portfolio, we have identified three retail stocks, namely Dillard's, Inc. DDS, Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM and Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA that are primed for a Santa Claus Rally.Notwithstanding inflationary pressure, the retail sector takes center stage with the arrival of the holiday season.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly sales stands at $2,451 million, indicating an 11% increase from the last fiscal-year quarter’s reported figure.However, Chewy’s bottom line is expected to decline from the last fiscal-year quarter’s reported figure.

CHWY reported a loss per share of 3 cents in the year-earlier quarter.This pet food and other pet-related supplier delivered an earnings surprise of 64.5%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported fiscal quarter, Chewy recorded an earnings surprise of 141.7%.Key Factors to NoteChewy’s sales performance for the fiscal third quarter is quite likely to have benefited from its e-commerce channels, product assortments and innovation efforts.  Management has been making technology upgrades for its website and online platforms for some time to drive online sales.Higher product demand, robust consumer engagement and growth in active customers are steadily contributing to results. Additionally, CHWY’s pharmacy business bodes well.However, the company’s quarterly performance might have been hurt by a tough macroeconomic environment, including headwinds like supply-chain issues and global inflationary pressures. These factors coupled with any deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses might have affected CHWY’s performance in the fiscal third quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Chewy this time around.

335,8cf8461d-95b1-3119-81c8-feca9889a7c9,ULTA,2022-12-08,Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Is Up 5.13% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-ulta-5-13-170005822.html,1670346005,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ulta Beauty currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ULTA that show why this beauty products retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor ULTA, shares are up 5.13% over the past week while the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry is up 1.41% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.68% compares favorably with the industry's 5.19% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Ulta Beauty have risen 5.91%, and are up 21.15% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 2.28% and -10.46%, respectively.Investors should also take note of ULTA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, ULTA is averaging 716,087 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with ULTA.Over the past two months, 10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ULTA's consensus estimate, increasing from $21.36 to $22.55 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 10 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that ULTA is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Ulta Beauty on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

337,1b75bd1a-0c42-32fc-8813-23dca27f4c23,VRTX,2022-12-08,Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's (NASDAQ:VRTX) Stock Been Rising: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vertex-pharmaceuticals-incorporateds-nasdaq-vrtx-120159912.html,1670500919,STORY,['VRTX'],"[Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:VRTX) stock up by 9.9% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Vertex Pharmaceuticals'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:25% = US$3.3b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.25 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 25% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a significantly high ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 25% the company's ROE is pretty decent. Given the circumstances, the significant 29% net income growth seen by Vertex Pharmaceuticals over the last five years is not surprising.Next, on comparing Vertex Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 28% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is VRTX worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether VRTX is currently mispriced by the market.Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

(Nasdaq: TRDA) today announced a global collaboration focused on discovering and developing intracellular Endosomal Escape Vehicle (EEV™) therapeutics for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The collaboration includes Entrada’s program for DM1, ENTR-701, which is in late-stage preclinical development.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221207005926/en/""Vertex’s strategy is to discover and develop transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, and DM1 has therefore been a disease area of interest to Vertex for some time,"" said David Altshuler, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Global Research, and Chief Scientific Officer of Vertex. ""Entrada’s innovative EEV approach, the significant progress in their DM1 program, and the potential for it to reach the clinic in the near-term hold exciting potential for patients. Working together, we believe we have the opportunity to develop a transformative treatment for this devastating disease.""""Our collaboration with Vertex represents an important step for Entrada as we work to make intracellular therapeutics a reality through our novel EEV approach,"" said Dipal Doshi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Entrada Therapeutics. ""DM1 is a progressive disease with no treatment options available. Working with Vertex will enable us to expeditiously move this program forward, while focusing the majority of our internal resources on advancing new therapeutic options for patients living with Duchenne and expanding our commitment to non-neuromuscular disease programs.""Story continuesTransaction TermsUnder the terms of the agreement, Entrada will receive an upfront payment of $224 million, as well as an equity investment of $26 million. Entrada is eligible to receive up to $485 million for the successful achievement of certain research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones, and tiered royalties on future net sales for any products that may result from this collaboration agreement.The agreement includes a four-year global research collaboration whereby Entrada will continue to advance and receive payments for certain research activities related to ENTR-701, as well as additional DM1-related research activities. Vertex will be responsible for global development, manufacturing and commercialization of ENTR-701 and any additional programs stemming from Entrada’s DM1 research efforts.The collaboration is subject to review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.About ENTR-701ENTR-701, a proprietary Endosomal Escape Vehicle (EEV™)-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, is the second novel clinical candidate from Entrada’s growing pipeline of EEV therapeutics. ENTR-701 is designed to address the underlying cause of myotonic dystrophy type 1 through allele-specific targeting of the disease-associated trinucleotide repeats in dystrophia myotonica protein kinase transcripts. In doing so, ENTR-701 has the potential to restore the function of muscle blind-like proteins, correct the mis-splicing and aberrant expression of downstream transcripts and restore normal muscle function. Data from preclinical studies of ENTR-701 suggest correction of disease relevant biomarkers in various muscle groups.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

CNC has joined forces with the city’s federally qualified health center, Community Health Development (CHDI), to gain an in-depth understanding of the diversified needs of the entire Uvalde community.Shares of Centene lost 0.5% on Dec 6, replicating declines in broader markets.While a groundbreaking ceremony was already held on December 2 at the center plot, the Uvalde Community Center is expected to be inaugurated in late 2024.On being operational, the community center will provide primary medical care and behavioral health services in a bid to address the health needs of the Uvalde community and neighboring areas. Additionally, the center will act as a means of availing youth development resources as well as imparting college and job preparation training to students. It will also assume the role of retail space for local businesses.The latest move can be termed a growth-related investment on the part of Centene. Through its Texas subsidiary, CNC has been successful in occupying a significant share of the managed care market of the state and the recent investment might further bolster its footprint.  Such partnerships with healthcare providers of a particular region enable Centene to deliver effective healthcare services and better serve the local community.The establishment of a multipurpose community center might lure more people in Texas to enroll in a Superior healthcare plan to avail the credible healthcare services of Uvalde’s center. This, in turn, will result in growing membership for Centene which will contribute to its premiums. Rising premiums sound well for health insurers since premiums usually contribute a chunk to the top line. As of Sep 30, 2022, CNC’s managed care membership grew 5% year over year.Story continuesCentene makes steadfast efforts to bolster its Managed Care business and several contract wins from time to time have further solidified its business. With an eye on intensifying focus on the same business, CNC resorted to divest two of its pharmacy businesses PANTHERx and Magellan Rx in 2022. It also sold its Spanish and Central European businesses this year, thereby highlighting the divestiture spree that the company had been on during 2022.Shares of Centene have gained 16.3% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 15.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCNC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The NDA submission for this 14-day short course, rapid-acting, oral investigational drug was initiated in May.The NDA included data from two development programs — LANDSCAPE and NEST. Clinical data on zuranolone demonstrated that the candidate achieved consistent, rapid, and sustained reductions in depressive symptoms with a good safety profile.

High inflation, rising rates, geopolitical tensions, supply-chain woes due to the zero-Covid policy in China made matters most difficult this year.As of Dec 2, 2022, 111 stocks hit a new 52-week high on Nasdaq, while 130 stocks hit a low. The figure for 52-week-high-hitting companies on NYSE was 90 and low-hitting companies was 44, per WSJ. When we look at the ETF world, data looks stricter. Only two sectors and their two ETFs managed to ride to the 52-week high spots. This shows that those sectors have the strength to stay afloat in the current economic turmoil.Below, we highlight those two sectors and their ETFs that have been hovering around their 52-week highs.Biotech &amp; PharmaVirtus Lifesci Biotech Products ETF BBPNasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF FTXHWith the pandemic being largely managed, thanks to the rollout of vaccines in record time, the biotech sector’s focus has shifted to new drug approvals, label expansion of existing drugs and acquisitions. Oncolytics ONCY surged 20.5% on Dec 1 after management announced that the FDA granted the second fast-track designation to its lead pipeline drug, pelareorep, in pancreatic cancer indication. Shares of Biogen (BIIB) too are hovering around a 52-week high due to the successful late-stage clinical trial for early Alzheimer's disease.Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, too, is in a bright spot. Earlier in November, the FDA began a rolling review of exa-cel — a gene therapy for the treatment of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease that Vertex is developing in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics. Vertex is also enrolling patients burdened by a rare kidney disorder into a mid-stage clinical trial. Plus, Pfizer (PFE) and AstraZeneca (AZN) inked a new M&amp;A deal. Eli Lilly’s (LLY) met Alzheimer's study goal.Story continuesMeanwhile, the legal marijuana market has ballooned lately, resulting in a multibillion-dollar business. President Joe Biden has officially signed a marijuana research bill into law. It marked history as it was the first piece of standalone federal cannabis reform legislation in U.S. history, reported Marijuana Moment, as quoted on Benzinga. The legal (which includes medical form) marijuana market is expected to witnessed a CAGR of 26.5% during 2023-2032, per digitaljournal.com.All these indicate that the sector is advancing with new deals and inventions. Plus, the sector’s non-cyclical nature makes it important even amid global growth slowdown.Aerospace &amp; DefenseUS Aerospace &amp; Defense iShares ETF ITA Aerospace &amp; Defense Invesco ETF PPAAerospace and defense stocks have rallied lately with rising geopolitical tensions. The Russia-Ukraine war is unlikely to end soon, North Korean saber rattling has been on the rise, and China-Taiwan tensions have flared up since President Xi secured a third term in office.Rising geopolitical tensions could result in increased defense spending by the United States and its European allies as they try to counter the military ambitions of China and Russia. Though the midterm elections resulted in split control of Congress, leading to legislative gridlock, increasing defense spending is one of the very few areas that the two parties agree on.Expansionary budgetary amendments adopted by the U.S. government for defense in recent times have acted as a major tailwind. In July 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to pave the way for the defense budget to exceed $800 billion next year, authorizing $37 billion in spending on top of the record $773 billion proposed by President Joe Biden.The sector has been beating the S&amp;P 500 consistently this year.

This hit Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc and sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq down for a third straight session.Most of the 11 major S&amp;P sectors were lower, with energy and communications services joining technology as leading laggards. Utilities, a defensive sector often preferred during times of economic uncertainty, fared better.Future economic growth prospects were in focus on Tuesday following comments from financial titans pointing toward uncertain times ahead.Bank of America Corp's chief executive predicted three quarters of mild negative growth next year, while JPMorgan Chase and Co's CEO Jamie Dimon said inflation will erode consumer spending power and that a mild to more pronounced recession was likely ahead.Their comments came on the heels of recent views from BlackRock and others that believe the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary tightening to combat stubbornly high price rises could induce an economic downturn in 2023.""The market is very reactive right now,"" said David Sadkin, president at Bel Air Investment Advisors.Story continuesHe noted that, while markets traditionally reflect the future, right now they are moving up and down based on the latest headlines.Fears about economic growth come amid a re-evaluation by traders of what path future interest rate hikes will take, following strong data on jobs and the services sector in recent days.Money market bets are pointing to a 91% chance that the U.S. central bank might raise rates by 50 basis points at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting, with rates expected to peak at 4.98% in May 2023, up from 4.92% estimated on Monday before service-sector data was released.The S&amp;P 500 rallied 13.8% in October and November on hopes of smaller rate hikes and better-than-expected earnings, although the expectation for slower rate hikes could be undermined by further data releases, including producer prices due out on Friday.""The market got ahead of itself at the end of November, but then we got some good economic data, so people are re-evaluating what the Fed is going to do next week,"" said Bel Air's Sadkin.According to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 lost 57.05 points, or 1.43%, to end at 3,941.79 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 225.01 points, or 1.99%, to 11,014.93. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 347.49 points, or 1.02%, to 33,599.61.Jitters on the direction of global growth have also weighed on oil prices, with U.S. crude slipping to levels last seen in January, before Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted supply markets. The energy sector fell on Tuesday.Banks are among the most sensitive stocks to an economic downturn, as they potentially face negative effects from bad loans or slowing loan growth. The S&amp;P banks index was down, with Bank of America a leading decliner.Elsewhere, Mirati Therapeutics Inc slumped after the company reported disappointing early trial data on its experimental cancer drug adagrasib.Textron Inc climbed after the U.S. Army awarded the contract for its next-generation helicopter to the company's Bell unit.

The S&amp;P 500 is down 17.83% year-to-date through December 7, and analysts are predicting more volatility in the upcoming months, possibly leading to a recession. In these times, investors tend to minimize risks of potential losses by prioritizing low-risk investments.Dividend investment is considered a safe option in the current economic landscape as these securities have historically outperformed the broader market with less volatility. According to a report by Fidelity, high-dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during the last two bear markets. The report also mentioned that dividends have accounted for nearly half of the total returns of the S&amp;P 500 over the past 30 years.This year’s returns have also exhibited the strong performance of dividend stocks over other asset classes. The Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index is down by just 0.95% year-to-date, which is very mild considering the broader market’s returns. Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, spoke to Barron’s in December about the overall performance of dividend stocks. He said that during periods of slow economic growth, investors load up on dividend stocks because of their defensive qualities. He further mentioned that dividend strategies are expected to outperform in 2023 as well, with high dividend growth companies stealing the limelight. Senyek named the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index one of his favorite plays, as the companies in the index are mainly known for their consistent dividend growth.Some dividend stocks that are popular amongst investors this year include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).

The program aims to identify and tackle disparities in tree canopy cover in three communities where Weyerhaeuser employees live and work and provide replicable best practices for communities nationwide. Students in those communities will learn about environmental justice issues and design a green project that gives them a window into the field of forestry.Weyerhaeuser Company logo. (PRNewsFoto/Weyerhaeuser Company)To kick off the initiative, 20 high school students studying green careers and social equity will put their knowledge to work this week, planting dozens of trees in a community park alongside local Weyerhaeuser volunteers in Ruston, La. The students are among roughly 200 at Ruston High School who were the first to engage with a new curriculum designed by American Forests with support from Weyerhaeuser and Project Learning Tree.Weyerhaeuser's partnership with American Forests is unique in that it brings the issue of Tree Equity beyond cities and into smaller communities also facing challenges of climate resilience and equity.The project is built around American Forests' Tree Equity Score (treeequityscore.org), a tool that helps gauge which neighborhoods in a community need trees the most. Until now, American Forests has only used the tool to calculate neighborhood scores nationwide for ""urbanized areas,"" or those with 50,000 people or more. With the support of Weyerhaeuser, the organization will apply the tool to ""urban clusters,"" areas with populations between 2,500 and 50,000, making the tool more accessible than ever and helping ensure that everyone experiences the health and climate benefits that trees provide no matter their race, income, age or neighborhood.Story continues""This project provides creative solutions to some of the cross-cutting challenges in our rural communities, including health and climate change,"" says Ara Erickson, vice president of corporate sustainability at Weyerhaeuser. ""By adapting the novel Tree Equity Score to smaller communities and piloting it in our own operating areas, we are directly helping more communities adapt to a changing climate and remain thriving places to live.""Unveiled last summer for the nation's 486 urbanized areas, the Tree Equity Score measures how well a neighborhood or municipality is ensuring the benefits of urban tree canopy reach every resident, particularly those susceptible to extreme heat, air pollution and other conditions. User-friendly and free to use, the tool has helped shine a light on pervasive disparities in tree canopy: Data show that in cities across the nation, whiter and wealthier neighborhoods tend to have more tree cover than neighborhoods with people of color and more low-income residents.""Not all neighborhoods are starting from the same place when it comes to trees,"" says Jad Daley, president and chief executive officer of American Forests. ""This is true in less populated communities as well as urban centers. As a company with deep roots in its communities, Weyerhaeuser understands this, and together we're extending the reach of our Tree Equity Score and technical assistance to help smaller communities work toward Tree Equity — ensuring that their most vulnerable people also are protected from the impacts of extreme heat and air pollution.""Weyerhaeuser and American Forests selected the project's three pilot locations based on several criteria, including demographics, government support for green priorities, health equity needs and the role of nonprofits in tree planting and environmental justice. After Ruston, La., the partners will implement the program in Tacoma, Wash., and also Natchitoches, La. Ruston and Natchitoches represent urban clusters and are home to Weyerhaeuser timberlands and a wood products manufacturing facility, respectively. Tacoma is an urbanized area and home to one of Weyerhaeuser's distribution centers.American Forests will also pilot in Ruston its Tree Equity Score Analyzer, a deeper dive into a community's urban forestry needs. This interactive tool supports both policy and project-level interventions by incorporating local data such as hospitalizations, carbon sequestration and flood risk, with ownership parcels. TESA can help community groups, residents, urban foresters, planners and community advocates identify parcel-specific planting opportunities and project how different tree planting scenarios will impact a Tree Equity Score and factors such as carbon captured, air quality and storm water. Community members will join a stakeholder council to help inform the process with local expertise and recommendations.Tree Equity Score is also the cornerstone of the new Tree Equity Curriculum: Exploring Green STEAM Careers, first introduced in Ruston this fall and expected to expand to other schools over the next year. Students will use the Tree Equity Score to learn about equity issues and design projects that address disparities in green spaces. Building on Project Learning Tree's Green Jobs Quiz, the curriculum allows students to explore urban and community forestry and its intersection with factors such as ecosystem services, pollution, income, ethnicity, age and health.After taking the quiz, students are matched with a related green occupation and then work in groups to design a greening project. Through hands-on volunteer opportunities, they'll help lead activities such as tree selection, site assessment, tree procurement and planting, and creating a maintenance plan. Weyerhaeuser employee volunteers will work with the students to implement the projects in their communities.By providing meaningful experiences to students, Weyerhaeuser and American Forests hope to inspire young people's passion for the environment and to pursue careers in urban and community forestry. Even as the desire to plant and maintain trees and forests for climate and public health grows more urgent, there aren't enough people qualified to do the work.""Building a workforce that can respond to this need will help create both climate and economic resilience in smaller communities,"" says Anne Leyva, manager of people development and giving programs for Weyerhaeuser. ""Weyerhaeuser is thrilled to partner on the Tree Equity project and provide additional support for our operating communities — helping them thrive today and for future generations.""ABOUT WEYERHAEUSERWeyerhaeuser Company, one of the world's largest private owners of timberlands, began operations in 1900.

(NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-not-telling-story-waste-120135313.html,1670500895,STORY,['WM'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 30.2x Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Waste Management certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Waste Management will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Waste Management's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Waste Management's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 31% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 32% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 11% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.0% per annum, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that Waste Management is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Waste Management's P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.We've established that Waste Management currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Waste Management   you should know about.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Waste Management.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Stryker as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies.

However, this wasn't enough as the latest three year period has seen a very unpleasant 29% drop in EPS in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why Stryker is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market.

(NYSE:DVA) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for DaVita The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$943.0mUS$964.0mUS$1.13bUS$1.15bUS$1.16bUS$1.19bUS$1.21bUS$1.23bUS$1.25bUS$1.28bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 1.73%Est @ 1.8%Est @ 1.86%Est @ 1.89%Est @ 1.92%Est @ 1.94% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% US$859US$799US$849US$787US$729US$675US$626US$581US$539US$500(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.9bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.8%– 2.0%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 9.8%)10= US$6.5bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$13b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$74.8, the company appears quite undervalued at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at DaVita as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.410. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For DaVita, we've compiled three important factors you should further research:Risks: As an example, we've found 2 warning signs for DaVita (1 is concerning!) that you need to consider before investing here.Future Earnings: How does DVA's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Therefore, the latest payout stands at 57 cents per share compared with the prior payout of 49 cents.This year reflects the ninth consecutive year of dividend increase. The increased dividend will be paid out on Feb 9, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Jan 9, 2023. Prior to the recent dividend hike, Mastercard had sanctioned a hike of 11% in its quarterly dividend in November 2021.MA has grown its dividend at a nine-year CAGR of 20.1%. It has also been a regular dividend-paying company since 2006. Based on the stock’s Dec 6 closing price of $347.53, the new dividend will yield 0.6% to the company.In addition to resorting to annual dividend hikes, Mastercard also engages in regular share buybacks. As a testimony to this fact and concurrent with the 16% dividend hike, the company unveiled a new share repurchase program, before the exhaustion of the entire amount in the current  buyback program.The new program equips Mastercard to buy back Class A common shares of up to $9 billion.The new program will come into effect once the prevailing share buyback program, which had around $4.1 billion left in it as of Dec 1, 2022, is concluded.Sustaining its history of prudent capital deployment, Mastercard continues to remain quite active on this front this year as well. In the first nine months of 2022, MA bought back 18.3 million shares worth $6.3 billion. It also paid dividends worth $1.4 billion to shareholders in the same time frame.Another indicator demonstrating Mastercard’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds remains its return on equity figure. The metric stood at 148.9% as of Sep 30, 2022, way higher than the industry’s average of 37.5%.The robust financial position of Mastercard is reflected by its uninterrupted dividend payments and pursuit of regular share buybacks. A strong financial stand is derived from growing cash reserves and sufficient cash-generating abilities. As of Sep 30, 2022, MA’s cash and cash equivalents improved 2.9% from the 2021-end level. Additionally, it generated operating cash flow of $8.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, which grew 29% from the prior-year comparable period.Story continuesShares of Mastercard have gained 1.5% in a year against the industry’s 15.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Some better-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are Barrett Business Services, Inc.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 72% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of General Electric. See our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that General Electric does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at General Electric's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in General Electric. Our data shows that Capital Research and Management Company is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 7.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of General Electric Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$227m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 28% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

366,2463c715-01ad-3f35-a86b-e26fa2f0f215,GE,2022-12-08,How the best leaders are preparing to navigate a recession—and come out ahead,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-leaders-preparing-navigate-recession-110039197.html,1670497239,STORY,['GE'],"[Good morning,As interest rates increase and consumer spending cools, many economists are pointing to a recession next year. And for CEOs and CFOs, learning from battle-tested coaches about leading during these uncertain times can help you win.The Fortune piece, “How CEOs can lead in a recession and come out stronger: 5 powerful strategies from corner-office veterans,” provides insight all C-suite leaders can use. Fortune's Shawn Tully spoke with several great current and former corporate leaders who opened up their playbooks to share how they weathered (and even triumphed in) periods of extreme adversity. Tully assembled a crisis preparation guide with lessons for leaders in any business.“We have lots of experience with economic challenges, and they come in all shapes and sizes,” Frank Bisignano, currently CEO of the fintech and payment platform Fiserv, told Tully. “But this is inflation like no other. You not only have the cost of goods rising at the fastest rate in decades, you have much less availability of supplies, and a workforce dynamic like you’ve never seen before. And they’re all hitting at the same time.”Bisignano has been in CEO roles for almost 10 years and has 30 years of experience as a top-ranking financial executive. The dot com crash struck while he was at Citigroup. His biggest takeaway from facing challenges: In a time of crisis, take care of your people. If a recession strikes, that employee loyalty “puts us in a position to come out of the downturn faster and stronger than our competitors,” Bisignano said.We’re experiencing the highest inflation in 40 years. “But David Cote, Honeywell’s CEO from 2002 to 2017, spent 23 years prior to that at General Electric, including a stint heading the appliance unit,” Tully writes. “That gave him the chance to observe how GE handled rocketing prices, both in the U.S. and in developing nations—and gives him clear insights about how CEOs should manage the scourge today.”Story continuesCote’s advice is to adopt a two-prong approach. The first step: “Continue to drive productivity, but recognize that your top priority has shifted to raising prices in anticipation of inflation. It’s crucial to lift prices ahead of the increases you expect from suppliers and add a big cushion in case your forecast is wrong,” Tully writes.Cote also advises focusing on the corrosive effect inflation has on your cash holdings, whose value plummets as inflation gets worse. He told Tully a solution is to return all that liquidity to shareholders or locate areas to invest where the returns beat inflation and that includes acquisitions. “That happened in the late 1970s at GE,” Cote noted.Another piece of advice from the leaders is to seize the opportunities a crisis can create. When Karen Lynch became CEO of CVS Health in February 2021, COVID was still devastating the country. But this was an opportunity for Lynch to put forth her plan to democratize the way Americans get care.“The pandemic really put us on the map as a health care company,” Lynch told Tully. For example, “CVS has remodeled over 950 of its more than 9,000 stores as HealthHUBs that offer chronic disease management and, in some locations, counseling from mental health professionals,” Tully writes. “By year’s end, Lynch aims to clinch a deal to acquire a large primary-care provider featuring a network of physicians’ offices. In the four quarters through September, the company’s free cash flow was $19.5 billion, nearly double the 2019 figure. Since Lynch took charge, CVS’s share price has jumped 40%, adding $38 billion in market cap.”You can read more here about strategies from several other time-tested leaders including Southwest Airlines' Gary Kelly and Ryanair's Michael O’Leary.See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership.I'm Alan Murray, and I'm here with my amazing co-host, Ellen McGirt.Ellen McGirt: Alan, Alan, it's so good to be with you.Murray: And it's the second to last episode of the season, Ellen. I can't believe it. We made it through the year.McGirt: I know. We did. I wasn't sure at some points that we were going to make it through but it has gone by so fast.Murray: It's so much fun to be able to have this opportunity to talk to the people who are leading the most successful companies in the world about what they're seeing, what they're doing, where they're going. And today's episode was a great example of that. We talked to a CEO who may not be a household name. His name is by the way, Tiger Tyagarajan. He is CEO of Genpact. Genpact isn't probably top of mind for most people, but it's a professional services company that spun out of GE quite a long time ago and has become one of the world's leaders in in helping companies go through digital transformation.McGirt: And he's a fascinating guy. He's been the CEO of Genpact since 2011, I believe, and he's done a lot during this time. But I'm going to ask him about what the company did during COVID. Because if there was ever a use case for caring about your employees, relentlessly caring about your customers and using technology to transform things, it's the kinds of work they were able to do making sure, for example, the vaccine was safe or that people had enough ventilators when they needed them.Story continuesMurray: You do that Ellen and I'm going to ask him about artificial intelligence, A.I., because over the course of the last five or six years, he's really been one of the people that I turn to get some guidance on how the great promise of these new technologies, how it's really been applied, and where it's really being applied in business and where it's falling short.McGirt: So it's good to have friends who are in the know and we're going to hear more about his leadership journey and philosophy. He started out as a sales manager in Mumbai, India to become a CEO of a publicly traded company.Murray: Yeah, good guy, great leader. Great story. Here's our conversation with Tiger Tyagarajan.McGirt: Tiger, it is so good to be back with you again. I think we have to start with the most basic question here. What does Genpact do? Because when I really look at it on paper, it looks like you're everything to everyone everywhere and that can't possibly be true.Tiger Tyagarajan: First of all, thank you, Ellen and Alan for inviting me into this conversation. And what an introduction. I'm going to bottle that up and keep it with me. So what do we do? It's actually a great question to ask because I would have answered the question very differently ten plus years back was today. So the best way to describe what we do is we partner with global 1000 companies, enterprises, across six industry verticals headquartered in typically developed economies of the world, and help them undertake change and transformation journeys using new technologies, data, analytics, and basically drive better outcomes for them, help them compete better in the marketplace. And anything that allows us to be able to do that with them and for them, is what we do.Murray: You have over the last five, six, seven years, you have been sort of my tutor and my mentor on all things A.I. and how it's transforming business. And I wonder if you could give us an update. I mean, we know the potential for these technologies to transform business is huge. But the reality doesn't always keep up with the potential and you get to see this play out across so many different companies and industries. Where does it stand right now? Where is A.I. being used effectively? Where are you seeing really revolutionary changes in business as a result of it?Tyagarajan: So Alan I’m glad you call me a tutor on A.I. because I think of myself as a student on A.I. Enterprises and leaders and we are still discovering the best and most effective way to leverage A.I. and machine learning. And a couple of things that people have learned is you know, you have to start with what is the outcome you're trying to deliver? That starts with making a few choices. You can't A.I. everything. So how do you make those choices? Go to those outcomes. Those outcomes could be customer outcomes, could be outcomes for your shareholders, could be outcomes for the community. You can pick the right stakeholder group, but big outcomes, and then say this is one of the technologies I'm going to leverage to deliver that outcome. Otherwise it becomes a hammer searching for a nail. The other learning that people have had is you can have a great technology that actually is able to produce great models using A.I. machine learning, but those models are pretty worthless unless the underlying data is good and clean and uncorrupt and so on. So, it goes back to data. And the other one is great, you built the model but if the people actually do not believe the model, do not want to use the model, bypass the model, then your model is not worth it anymore. Because A.I. has to constantly learn and only when people use it, they can learn. So lots of things to unpack there. But A.I. is still in its early days of infancy, but I think it's pretty clear what works and what doesn't work.Murray: Yeah, that's fascinating: both the fact that it can't be a technology first approach that you have to focus on outcomes. You can't let it be a hammer that pounds down every nail and that it has to be people first. So with all of that as a background, where are you seeing in these early days, the most transformative applications of A.I.Tyagarajan: The most important aspect that an A.I. delivers is prediction. And, you know, humans and the brains that all of us have and the minds that we have are constantly predicting outcomes, and therefore the decisions that we have to take. What an A.I. does is understand patterns and help me as the person who's trying to take a decision predict and gives me the prediction for me to finally act. A great example of that is a whole set of insurance applications are coming in and the enterprise, the insurance company, wants to decide which application to attack first, to take a decision. Now first, in first out is the typical way humans behave. The noisiest person gets acted upon first is the other way you can behave, so the broker who's noisy gets attention first. But the best way for an enterprise to behaviors, which is the customer that is going to be my long-term relationship that is coming through a channel, that is a broker that I really like, that is a good risk to take, that has good pricing and profitability that I can delight the customer with.Murray: Good example. Can you give us one or two others?Tyagarajan: Let's take a private label credit card of a bank. You know, we take the data from the private label credit card of all the people who have bought using that credit card off that retailer and we go back and say look, there are some people who are using the card a lot. There are others who are not. We figure out who they are and why. To do that I go back to the retailer and get information about the actual buying patterns of those customers, both on the card and outside the card. And lo and behold you find a whole set of customers who are big users of the card, and every time they shop in that retail, they use the card. But there's a whole set of other people who are actually big shoppers, both online and in the store, but they don't use that particular card. They use other cards or they write a check and you try to understand what is it that is making people not use the card? Because the whole idea is to make people use the card. So we worked with that financial services institution and the retailer to make it a win win win for everyone by identifying those customers who are behaving in a certain way and predicting the next time they come to shop, what is the nudge you give them to make them use the card?Murray: Ellen, I'm just going to ask one more question about this and then we can leave A.I. behind but I'm so fascinated and I think there's so much ahead for us on this. One of the things when we first started talking about this five or six years ago, one of the great fears was A.I. was going to replace humans, but the examples you're giving, these are really not replacement functions, they are enhancing humans. Is that what you're finding?Tyagarajan: The narrative out there had always been A.I. will destroy jobs. So what are we going to do? And you know many people including me had always said that A.I. will actually create jobs. Obviously they require some new skills, but they will create jobs. All technologies are always in the end creating jobs. We've always thought about A.I. as not artificial intelligence but augmented intelligence. The intelligence is still the human intelligence, it's augmentation of that. We’re seeing that play out. I mean, who would have thought that as digital transformation takes hold, unemployment is still not as high as typically one would find in a recession. So I believe that the value creation opportunity that the world has in all aspects, including things like the big topic of climate change, the big topic of social equality, A.I. can play a very big role and those are all enhancing, value creating and job enriching, and more jobs needed.McGirt: I also want to get into the work that you all did during the pandemic, was your adverse event reporting work that you did with the U.K. government. I mean, to me, that kind of work was extraordinary. And I think if more people understood the true nuances around A.I., it would have changed the conversation about trust in the vaccine in some interesting ways. Can you tell that story, please.Tyagarajan: That's one of the most gratifying and satisfying stories in actually my entire career. This is when any pharmaceutical company launches a new drug or actually has a drug that it sells, it constantly is listening for any adverse events that any user of medicine reports. And obviously these days you can report in 10,000 different ways. You can tweet, you can email, you can send a fax. Believe it or not, people send faxes. Or telephone a 1-800 number and basically say “I have a problem this morning. Because I had a tablet for a simple headache, and I don't feel good this morning.” That is an adverse event. And regulatorily every pharmaceutical company has to put that together and reporting after analyzing whether it's a false positive or that it’s really a problem. The reality is that it's possible that the bottle in which the medicine is sold has a label which says you're not supposed to have a glass of wine when you have a tablet. It actually says that. People like me don't read labels. We just pop the tablet and then we had a glass of wine. The next morning, I send them an adverse event complaint. In reality, there's nothing wrong with the medicine, it's all fine. But once in a while, the complaint is a real complaint, and that becomes a true adverse event. Now, here's the interesting thing, the speed with which you can pick out the needle in the haystack can make a difference to lives. You know the stories of the old medicines that are a problem. If people had detected it one week earlier, lives could have been saved. So you want to get the medicine out fast. At the same time, you want to catch every adverse event and make sure it's okay.McGirt: And that's what you were able to do with the U.K. government during the during the Covid trials.Tyagarajan: That's right. Basically we took all the data and passed it through to compare it to the medical dictionaries and language and so on and said, here's the one needle in the haystack. Look at this one first. And that makes a huge difference.McGirt: That is such a good story. I want to continue on the subject of COVID because it was such a transformational and painful moment for everyone. But something extraordinary happened November 2020, where all of the work that you've been doing to build a culture that's maniacally focused on the customer is suddenly, a new purpose has come into view. Can you tell us about that time?Tyagarajan: Again, Ellen, your memory is amazing of our story. So for many years, we hadn't defined a very explicit purpose for the company. In retrospect, I now realized that we had been living our purpose without ever defining it, which is which is fascinating. What happened during the pandemic, there was a realization that as we became much more virtual and continued to become global and hiring new people, we had to anchor people on a stated purpose. So we undertook a journey of identifying our purpose. We went to our employees, our customers, our stakeholders, we did a bunch of workshops, etc. And quickly narrowed down to the purpose that we ultimately honed in on. And what we realized is we had been living the purpose all along, we just hadn't put it on a piece of paper. The relentless pursuit of a world that works better for people. And, you know, whether it is the adverse event report story that you described, or it's the way our employees reacted to Covid making sure that they looked after each other and prevented, you know, really bad things happening to everyone around them. At the same time, we didn't want to drop the ball even for an hour on some of the things that we do for clients because of the realization that we work we do keeps the world going round. So you know that purpose is now rallying our people across the globe. And we really are thrilled with the fact that we can explicitly now describe it and anchor ourselves around it.Murray: Fascinating. So your purpose revealed itself.Tyagarajan: That’s right. Great. Phrase.[Music]Murray: I'm here with Joe Ucuzoglu, who is the CEO of Deloitte US and had the good sense to sponsor this podcast. Thanks for being with us and thanks for your support.Joe Ucuzoglu: Thanks, Alan. Pleasure to be here.Murray: So, Joe, this new wave of business technology, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, the ability to make intelligence out of data, is creating huge opportunities for companies. But a lot of the CEOs I talk to feel daunted by it. It's like where do they get the imagination to rethink their entire corporation? How did they deal with that?Ucuzoglu: The opportunities are immense, particularly when you look at not just any one of these technologies individually, but the convergence of all of them collectively creating the opportunity to truly transform business models. And I know it can seem daunting, but the reality is taking the first step in actually produces huge benefits. Because what we're finding is that many of the cutting-edge applications are not coming out of the corporate headquarters. They're coming out of putting the technology in the hands of our people on the front lines, they find new and innovative uses. We then funnel them back up and leverage them across the entire client base.Murray: It really gets to the importance of a culture of innovation at the company.Ucuzoglu: It is essential that our people feel empowered to take the latest and greatest and to find new and innovative ways to use it for productive purposes.Murray: Thank you, Joe.Ucuzoglu: Alan, it's a real pleasure.[Music ends]Murray: So I want to go back to Ellen's very first question, which is what is Genpact? Because old folks like me know that Genpact grew out of General Electric and you were a product of General Electric. And that really leads me to two questions that I think you're well positioned to talk about. One is what did you learn from Jack Welch and his leadership that is still valuable to you today? And the second question is, what's changed? What are the things about Jack that probably wouldn't work today the way they did 20 years ago?Tyagarajan: Alan, I'm biased. I grew up in the GE in the early 90s and late 90s was all driven by Jack as the CEO. And he was a bigger than life CEO, as we all know, so I learned a lot. So I'll start with, you know, the candor and transparency within the company, across the company, in every corner of the company. We were a little business, meaning a fourth decimal point of revenue and market cap and so on for GE. I was this little person in that little corner of GE and he knew what we were doing. He talked about some of the things that we were doing, just based on a quick conversation in a car ride from the airport to the office on his one trip to GE to India for four days, where I hosted him for, originally planned 90 minutes turned out to be five hours, because he canceled a whole bunch of meetings because he fell in love with what we were doing. And that conversation in that car, then goes back and relates all the things we're doing to other people to look at is, etc. So there is something about the way he communicated across the length and breadth of half a million people across businesses that had no right to talk to each other—royalty payments for NBC Universal and credit cards and aircraft engines. What connection? Well Jack Welch and leadership connection. So that's one learning I had. The other one was, I mean, I'm a big believer that I drive myself every day with one word, which is curiosity. I live my life anchored on curiosity. I actually saw that live in action for the seminar eight years under his leadership every day. I mean, you would walk into the room and all you would have is question after question after question. I believe living a life asking questions is such a great way to live life and constantly learning from others.Murray: And Tiger for for those of us who were journalists, I mean, that was what we loved about that as well, because he was the same way externally as he was internally. But you know, there been a couple of books, there's this sort of reappraisal going on now, that focuses on things like Jack was the consummate manager of quarterly earnings. You know, give the market exactly what you told them, they were going to get and even play some games, some of which didn't look so good in retrospect, to get there. And second there were these internal management processes like rank and yank, we're going to fire the bottom 10% or 20% of every year, that in today's world don't look like a particularly effective way to manage. So was he a just a product of his time? Or do you think the reappraisals are wrong? Or how do you view all that?Tyagarajan: So I think the first statement I would make is, we must reappraise because reappraisal is asking questions. I love the fact that I worked in that era and I learned so much from Jack. But I do reappraise saying, I don't think that's going to work here because the world has changed. The ranking of people, I was a big believer. I used it. It worked. It doesn’t work now. It doesn't work with my son. He's 28 and it doesn’t work with him. So social norms change. Cultural norms change. Expectations change. Technology changes. The speed at which information flows has dramatically changed. Hierarchies is not the way enterprises work at all. The trick I think about leadership, is making sure that while I admire and respect everything I learned from Jack, I have absolutely no qualms and desire to hold on to everything that I learned at that time. If I know that it’s not going to work, I have to change and I have to adapt. And I would say I probably learned that from Jack as well because he used to say, if you can't get to number one, number two, move on, get to the next business. You know, you can take the good and then leave the bad behind is the way I would approach it.McGirt: It sounds like an ability to manage a constantly changing world is going to be essential for the next generation of leaders coming up. What are you looking for in the next generation of leaders? And how can they signal that they are prepared to lead?Tyagarajan: Ellen, one of the things that I have always been a believer in it's probably turning out to be more true than I had expected and probably faster than I'd expected, is what people know and the knowledge and experience they have and the skills they have are less important in what I look for and what my team looks for in people who are going to be successful in the long run. Because what they know and their experiences are probably not going to be relevant X months, years, quarters later. So the question that we explore is, are you constantly learning? Do you believe actually shedding old beliefs and bringing new beliefs in is a good thing to do? Or are you dogmatic in your beliefs? You're never going to change? Do you know how to learn? That starts with being humble. Do you reveal your ignorance? If you don't reveal your ignorance, I don't know how anyone can teach you because they don't know what to teach you because they don't know what you don't know. Do you learn from people who are much younger, much less experienced because they know that topic more than you ever would have imagined? And do you actually go to them and sit down and say teach me? Yes, I have 30 years experience but you know this topic more than I do. So, so finding such people and are passionate about this not passive, they seek learning. They are driven. They wear it on their sleeves, because when people wear things on their sleeves, they get a followership. You want people who are not only behave like this but behave like this visibly, because you want a thousand people to follow them and say I want to be like you. So then you have a followership on the topic of I want to learn, I want to excel, I want to constantly challenge my own beliefs and I want to surround myself with people who are diverse. Because if I surround myself with people who are not diverse, then what are the chances that their beliefs are my beliefs? So where is the challenge?Murray: I want to ask you a big question here, Tiger. A question about the world because Genpact was a creature of the globalization of the 20th century and the whole move towards business processes outsourcing and saying, hey, we can you know there are all these really smart people in India that we can deploy to do this for us, let's let it happen over there. We're in a very different era right now. Geopolitics is different. Supply chain problems have just made people think very differently about this. And there's a whole process of friend shoring, reshoring people thinking about getting everything back home, as opposed to leaving it all over the world. What's your assessment of that? Where are we in the state of globalized business?Tyagarajan: It's a great question, Alan, and I would say unfortunately, the answer is going to be heavily nuanced. So let's take a few things. So if you look at a manufacturing company that is predominantly dependent on China for its supply chain, pretty much end-to-end supply chain, then I would argue, irrespective of cost, there is a problem. Because there is a resilience problem that is obvious. Irrespective of trade wars, etc. there is a resilience problem that should be sorted. Does that sorting out of the resilience problem mean diversify the answer? Yes. Does that diversification mean bring it near shore? I don't know. After all, Apple decided that it needed to diversify manufacturing of the iPhone 14 out of China. In my mind, I was expecting it to happen at some point in time, the speed at which it happened is I think a reflection of the world we are in and now we are manufacturing that is happening for iPhone 14 in India as well.Now that's globalization, but that's not so part of the answer to the question is, I think concentration of anything and swinging the pendulum too much to an extreme or anything is a problem. Having a balance that is distributed on lots of topics is the way I think the world is going to go. The world of digital and technology and information flow allows that to happen, because there are going to be some things that will be needed in cycle times that no supply chain can deliver. Those are best done really close to you. There are some things that can be done from far away, in which case don't distribute it to one place, distribute it to an ecosystem that has the ability to create resilience. We've had situations in the last 12 to 18 months, where a number of our new clients have come to us and said, I need you and I need you with your global footprint because my footprint is too concentrated in location x or location y. So I need to globalize more because I realize that because I'm not global, I've not been able to leverage that resiliency that some my competitors have.Murray: So what does that meant to Genpact’s geographical footprint? I mean, you started out very much with an Indian workforce. What does it look like today?Tyagarajan: From 1997 the first set of people we hired and trained and deployed were in India. In 2005, Jan. 1, when we spun off from GE, we had four countries we delivered services from India, China, Budapest and Hungary and Mexico. Today we have 34 countries we deliver services from. India is still the biggest, but it's only 70,000 people. Only 70,000 people out of 120,000 people. 50,000 people are in 33 other countries. And if I pick a country that I just came back from, Poland, as an example, we have four cities we deliver services from. We have 3000 people in polling. They're doing some amazing work in supply chain for Europe for a couple of very large consumer goods and manufacturing companies. They forecast demand. They line up supply. They build up resiliency in that supply. They then orchestrate transportation to try and reduce cost of transportation. But these days, they're also trying to reduce carbon footprint in transportation because the client itself is focused on ESG. So that ecosystem is all polling. And therefore, you know, when you think about resiliency, we have an India footprint for the U.S. for them. And then we have a Polish footprint for Europe. However, those teams are crosstrained and our ability to move talent back and forth our ability to move work back and forth as long as we have information flow and connectivity is where the world is.Murray: So from where you sit the world of businesses is as globalized as ever or more than ever.Tyagarajan: It is but as I said, it has nuances. So it's very, very important to be constantly listening more. And there times when it's very important to have a workforce that are very close to the client and actually encourage them to do that. So we now have close to 9,000 people in the U.S. in five operating centers in the U.S. and 10 years back that was not even 1,000. So it's grown 10 times and the work they do is sensitive, is regulated, is time sensitive, is customer sensitive, needs reaction time and response time. And it’s also culturally sensitive in the sense that we need to understand the local culture deeply and therefore it's best to be done out of Florida or Texas or Illinois or Pennsylvania, four of our big centers in the U.S.McGirt: It sounds like you literally live inside a fully diverse ecosystem of inputs and ideas and business pressures and opportunities that's fully global. How do you take these inputs and these insights and this information and began to chart a path forward? I don't know if you use A.I. but I wouldn't be surprised if you did.Tyagarajan: In my free time I listen to a lot of podcasts. I'm a big fan of that by the way, because I walk a lot and run a lot.Murray: Leadership Next is no doubt at the top of the list.Tyagarajan: It’s already on my list. However, most of the podcasts I listen to are not business podcasts, they are podcasts about the way the mind works and the way evolution has happened, etc. And one of the things that is obvious is that it's important for our kind of an ecosystem to be constantly listening. What does listening mean for us? It means that we need to have our tentacles out in the world. We need to be with our clients. Fortunately, our clients are very diverse, as you said, they're very global, they’re very distributed and they have all kinds of challenges. So if we have the ability as an organization to pick up those signals in advance, and to connect multiple signals that we pick up from Australia, from Japan, from Germany, from Poland, four countries I just visited in the last eight weeks, and then be able to come together and say, what does this all mean? What does this mean when people, when enterprises in Japan are really beginning to talk about China risk? I found that to be a fascinating conversation just five weeks back. I've been to Japan twice a year for the last 25 years other than the two years in between for the pandemic. I’ve never had a China risk conversation like I did this time. And it tells me that people are thinking about a world where maybe it is required to think that and therefore it's our job to figure out what does that mean for the future? I'm not a big believer in forecasting five years forward. I never was. I’ve become less of a believer these days. I'm a big believer in having continuous forecasts and updating through continuous listening. And as an organization, we have the luxury of being able to do that in a such a widespread way and then have the agility to change rapidly as you form patterns of I think this is going to happen. We recognized supply chain as a problem in 2017, well before the pandemic and thank God we did that because we doubled down and we did an acquisition and we built out capabilities. And then, boom, the pandemic happened and it took on a whole life of its own. So today supply chain, is one of our fastest growing services because of that.McGirt: Is another way of saying what you just said is don’t fall in love with forecasts begin to get interested in really good likely scenarios and that gives you a chance more to fall in love with the problem that you’re trying to solve rather than the solution that you think you have?Tyagarajan: Extremely well put. So scenarios is a word that has really raised its head a lot in the last six, nine months. Forecast is important but re-forecast in very fast cycles. If you used to do once a quarter do once a week.Murray: Tiger this has, as always, been a fascinating conversation. Every conversation with you is. Thank you for taking the time to talk to the two of us. We've covered not just how A.I. is changing business but, but how listening and learning and scenario planning is all so critical to leading a business today. Great to be with you.Tyagarajan: Alan and Ellen, thank you so much for inviting me to this conversation.Murray: Leadership Next is edited by Nicole Vergalla, written by me, Alan Murray, along with my amazing colleagues, Ellen McGirt and Megan Arnold.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World. If there is one industry that often sounds as if it is in the realm of science fiction, it is nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the use of materials science industrially involving matter whose dimensions range between one nanometer to 100 nanometers. For reference, a single strand of a human hair ranges anywhere between 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers, so nanotechnology, by definition, involves manipulating matter to sizes that are up to 100,000 times smaller than a hair on your head.Owing to the advantages offered by this unique manipulation, nanotechnology is adopted in a variety of different industries. These include construction, healthcare, and energy. In the construction industry, these technologies are used to create new materials that are durable and provide lucrative benefits such as water resistance, corrosion protection, and even self cleaning. Another widely popular application is the semiconductor industry, which has successfully created transistors that are now as small as 3 nanometers. Healthcare is another segment that benefits from nanotechnology, as nanotubes, owing to their small size, are effective fighters against cancer cells. These treatments involve injecting the nanotubes in the vicinity of cancer cells, and once they are bombarded with lasers, they generate heat that ends up killing the cancer cells. Nanoparticles are also used to bypass the blood-brain barrier due to their small size.Moving towards the industry itself, and growth estimates, the nanotechnology sector is projected to strongly grow due to its novelty and relatively nascent nature. For instance, a research report from Valuates Reports believes that the nanotechnology market was worth $1.76 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.4% between then and 2030 to be worth $33.63 billion by the end of the forecast period. The firm also believes that healthcare will be the largest segment, and nanodevices will be the most lucrative product category. Furthermore, it also outlines that Asia Pacific industry segment will grow at 40%, to outpace the overall industry trend, and the aerospace and defense sector will be the fastest growing user with a whopping 43.4% CAGR.Story continuesAnother report, this time from Atlantic Market Research, estimates a 13.6% CAGR for the nanotechnology market. According to the research firm, the industry will be worth $11.7 billion in 2023. Atlantic Market Research also outlines that electronic applications will hold a 27% market share of the nanotechnology market from 2021 to 2030. It adds that North America held a 21% market share of the nanomaterials market in 2020, and a 38% share of the broader nanotechnology market during the same year.Finally, Precedence Research has the largest estimate for the future value of the nanotechnology market. This research firm believes that the industry was worth $85 billion in 2021, and it will grow to a stunning $288 billion by 2030 through a 14.5% CAGR. Precedence Research also believes that as of May 2022, 20,000 nanotechnology researchers were working in the United States, and despite this, China will be the largest player in the future as well in addition to holding a 35% market share in 2021. Some key trends for the sector include semiconductors and electronics, while hurdles include the difficulties of scaling up the production of the products. These include the recent chip shortages that have created difficulties for both personal computing and automotive markets recently.Today's piece will focus on companies that work in the nanotechnology industry, and it ranges from those that provide the products and services to those that provide backend support. Top players include International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the Worldscience photo/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We took a look at several industries such as chip fabrication, healthcare, and industrials to determine which companies use nanotechnology.

GE and LineVision will combine Dynamic Line Ratings (DLR), Dynamic Power Rating (DPR), and Optimal Power Flow Controllers (OPFC) to significantly increase transmission capacity while ensuring grid reliability.LineVision LogoGlobally, the need to optimize the existing transmission grid and expand its ability to carry more clean energy has never been more urgent. In the US, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has reported that grid capacity must triple to achieve zero carbon by 2035[1]. A lack of sufficient capacity is preventing 1.4 terawatts of renewables and energy storage from connecting to the grid and this year has caused nearly $100 billion in congestion costs that are paid by consumers[2],[3].Europe aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by the end of the decade compared to 1990 levels and source 40% of its energy consumption from renewable energy[4]. However, this shift to renewable energy sources won't be realized without expanding transmission capacity which is already lacking, resulting in congestion and record-high prices of electricity.Australia is preparing for the clean energy transition with 67GW of renewable energy projects in the interconnection queue but grid congestion has prevented much of that capacity from becoming operational[5].""Our utility clients know that increased renewable integration and electrification requires a flexible and dynamic grid,"" said Claudia Cosoreanu, CTO of GE Grid Automation, Grid Solutions. ""Dynamic System Rating will change how utility operators optimize the grid and enable them to integrate more renewables using the same infrastructure. This will reduce the amount of investment needed to reach decarbonization goals and keep the electricity costs to affordable levels for everyone.Story continues""These technologies represent a new model of grid infrastructure investment which will accelerate the transition to a net zero grid,"" said Hudson Gilmer, CEO of LineVision. ""Transmission capacity is the limiting factor preventing the clean energy economy from becoming a reality. The solution now exists to rapidly and fully optimize our existing assets.""About GE Grid SolutionsGrid Solutions, a GE Renewable Energy business, serves customers globally with over 13,000 employees.

When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks that are incurring losses or in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profit.What’s Price-to-Sales Ratio?While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investors’ favor, its price-to-sales could indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, a stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Valero Energy Corp. VLO, PBF Energy Inc. PBF, TravelCenters of America Inc. TA, DCP Midstream, LP DCP and ePlus inc. PLUS are some companies that have a low price-to-sales ratio and the potential to offer higher returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Valero is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States.

CNC has joined forces with the city’s federally qualified health center, Community Health Development (CHDI), to gain an in-depth understanding of the diversified needs of the entire Uvalde community.Shares of Centene lost 0.5% on Dec 6, replicating declines in broader markets.While a groundbreaking ceremony was already held on December 2 at the center plot, the Uvalde Community Center is expected to be inaugurated in late 2024.On being operational, the community center will provide primary medical care and behavioral health services in a bid to address the health needs of the Uvalde community and neighboring areas. Additionally, the center will act as a means of availing youth development resources as well as imparting college and job preparation training to students. It will also assume the role of retail space for local businesses.The latest move can be termed a growth-related investment on the part of Centene. Through its Texas subsidiary, CNC has been successful in occupying a significant share of the managed care market of the state and the recent investment might further bolster its footprint.  Such partnerships with healthcare providers of a particular region enable Centene to deliver effective healthcare services and better serve the local community.The establishment of a multipurpose community center might lure more people in Texas to enroll in a Superior healthcare plan to avail the credible healthcare services of Uvalde’s center. This, in turn, will result in growing membership for Centene which will contribute to its premiums. Rising premiums sound well for health insurers since premiums usually contribute a chunk to the top line. As of Sep 30, 2022, CNC’s managed care membership grew 5% year over year.Story continuesCentene makes steadfast efforts to bolster its Managed Care business and several contract wins from time to time have further solidified its business. With an eye on intensifying focus on the same business, CNC resorted to divest two of its pharmacy businesses PANTHERx and Magellan Rx in 2022. It also sold its Spanish and Central European businesses this year, thereby highlighting the divestiture spree that the company had been on during 2022.Shares of Centene have gained 16.3% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 15.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCNC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about a global economic recovery.Year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have plunged 7.6%, 29.6% and 17.3%, respectively. The global economy has been going through a massive slowdown due to the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.Given the current highly volatile market environment and the growing fears of an incoming recession, investors are panicking about investing in the market. Does it mean that there are no sectors to invest in amid this market volatility?We believe that investing in defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities and Health Care amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and the highly volatile market scenario might provide stability to one’s portfolio and fetch some returns as well.These sectors comprise companies providing necessary products and services of daily use.

The news follows its agreement in November to divest Magellan Specialty Health to Evolent Health for $750 million.The company has a strong inorganic growth strategy in place, targeted at expanding the company’s markets and increasing its Medicaid membership. Nevertheless, it does not shy away from shedding non-core and less profitable operations to improve efficiency and profitability.In July 2022, the company divested its pharmacy business, PANTHERx, which it acquired in 2020. It was expected to receive a total of $2.8 billion from the PANTHERx and Magellan Rx divestments.

380,a59905e2-ccc2-3a63-8c03-069c66d91991,REG,2022-12-08,Should You Be Adding Regency Centers (NASDAQ:REG) To Your Watchlist Today?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adding-regency-centers-nasdaq-reg-101755423.html,1670494675,STORY,['REG'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Regency Centers (NASDAQ:REG). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Regency Centers with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Regency Centers Regency Centers' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, Regency Centers has grown EPS by 17% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. It's noted that Regency Centers' revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. The good news is that Regency Centers is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 4.4 percentage points to 42%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Regency Centers' future EPS 100% free.Are Regency Centers Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$11b company like Regency Centers. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$87m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Regency Centers, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.The Regency Centers CEO received US$7.0m in compensation for the year ending December 2021. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is Regency Centers Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors, Regency Centers' raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that Regency Centers is worth keeping an eye on. Even so, be aware that  Regency Centers is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are significant...The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

It may not have been easy to hold on to ADP for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Automatic Data Processing's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Automatic Data Processing's main business drivers.Automatic Data Processing, Inc. is one of the leading providers of cloud-based Human Capital Management (HCM) technology solutions - including payroll, talent management, Human Resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management - to employers around the world. The company delivers it’s global HCM strategy and make investments in highly strategic areas and technology in order to strengthen its underlying business model and prospects for continued growth.The company was founded in 1949, incorporated in the State of Delaware in June 1961 and completed its initial public offering in September 1961. The company serves more than 740,000 clients across 110 countries and territories.ADP has two reportable business segments – Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services.Employer Services: The Employer Services segment offers a comprehensive suite of HRO and technology-based HCM solutions which includes payroll services, benefits administration, talent management, HR management, time and attendance management, insurance services, retirement services and compliance services. The company mainly serves clients ranging from single-employee small businesses to large enterprises with tens of thousands of employees around the world. In fiscal 2021, revenues from this segment increased 1% year over year on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis.Story continuesProfessional Employer Organization (PEO) Services: The Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services segment provides small and medium-sized businesses with employment administration outsourcing solutions, including payroll, payroll tax filing, HR guidance, 401(k) plan administration, benefits administration, compliance services, health and workers' compensation coverage, and other supplemental benefits for the employees. Revenues from this segment increased 8% on a year over year basis in fiscal 2021.ADP’s PEO business, named ADP TotalSource is the largest PEO in the United States based on the number of worksite employees. It serves approximately 12,500 clients and more than 562,000 worksite employees across 50 states and operates as a certified PEO under the United States Internal Revenue Code.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Automatic Data Processing ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in December 2012 would be worth $4,493.05, or a gain of 349.30%, as of December 7, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 178.74% and gold's return of -0.20% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for ADP.ADP's shares have outperformed its industry in the past year, partly due to consecutive earnings and revenue beat in the past four quarters. The company continues to enjoy a dominant position in the human capital management market through strategic buyouts like Celergo, WorkMarket, Global Cash Card and The Marcus Buckingham Company. It has a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure. Further, it continues to innovate, improve operations and invest in its ongoing transformation efforts. On the flip side, ADP faces significant competition in each of its product lines. Failure to remain technologically updated might reduce the demand for its solutions and services. Rising expenses due to investment in transformation efforts remains a concern. High debt remains a concern.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.51%, and there have been 10 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Automatic Data Processing has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing peKeen to find out how analysts think Automatic Data Processing's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Automatic Data Processing's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 14%. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 34% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% per year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Automatic Data Processing's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Automatic Data Processing maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Having said that, be aware  Automatic Data Processing is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.You might be able to find a better investment than Automatic Data Processing.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. RH (RH) earns a Zacks Rank #3 one day from its next quarterly earnings release on December 8, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.72 a share.RH's Earnings ESP sits at 0.41%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.72 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.70.RH is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on January 18, 2023, Procter &amp; Gamble holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.58 a share 42 days from its next quarterly update.Procter &amp; Gamble's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.25% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, RH and PG could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

388,2b13ef30-4e18-3e2a-9f64-f47ba999391f,SLG,2022-12-08,SL Green (SLG) Cuts Annual Dividend Rate to Meet 2023 Targets,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sl-green-slg-cuts-annual-145902293.html,1670425142.0,STORY,"['SLG', 'SLG-PI']","[SL Green Realty Corp. SLG recently announced a cut in its annual ordinary dividend payment on its common stock and units of its operating partnership from $3.73 per share to $3.25. This marks a reduction of 12.9%.Reflecting negative sentiments, shares of SLG lost nearly 6.6% on Dec 6 normal trading session on the NYSE.Consequently, the monthly ordinary dividend now stands at 27.08 cents per share, which will be paid out on Jan 17, 2023, to shareholders on record as of Dec 30, 2022. SL Green will continue to pay this reduced dividend in cash on a monthly basis.This move comes as part of the company’s efforts to match its present estimation of funds available for distribution (FAD) for 2023, which is $221.3 million. This permits SLG to balance out between the yield on its common stock, and its liquidity forecast of nearly $1.6 billion and its target to lower its combined debt by almost $2.4 billion in 2023.Simultaneously, in its latest institutional investor conference, SL Green outlined its guidance for 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share. It expects the same to lie in the range of $5.30-$5.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $6.16 per share.Moreover, for 2022, the company estimates FFO per share to lie between $6.70 and $7.00 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same presently stands at $6.70 per share.SLG anticipates its pro-rata share of same-store net operating income to be within 2.5-3.5% for 2023.Given the rising interest rate environment, the company expects interest expense (including amortization of deferred financing costs) and preferred dividends to be $343.8 million for 2022, up from its initial forecast of $295.8 million. For 2023, the same is anticipated to be $413.2 million.The United States office real estate market has been choppy for quite some time now, with negative absorption and increasing vacancy levels. The continuation of the flexible working environment and pandemic-led job cuts have led to diminishing office space utilization.Even with many companies implementing a return-to-office policy, any significant turnaround is less likely in the near term. SLG expects office occupancy to be lower in the first half of 2023, with same-store office occupancy to hover around 90%.Furthermore, amid the choppy office environment, the average tenant concessions were nine months of free rent with a tenant improvement allowance of $81.94 per rentable square foot for the nine months ended on Sep 30, 2022. This excluded the leases signed at One Vanderbilt Avenue, One Madison Avenue and the MSK lease at 885 Third Avenue.Analysts, too, seem bearish about this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for company’s 2022 FFO does not indicate a favorable outlook, as it has been revised marginally downward over the past month.Shares of SL Green have lost 11.5% in the quarter-to-date period against its industry’s growth of 4.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Lamar Advertising LAMR and Chatham Lodging Trust REIT CLDT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

You can skip our detailed analysis of the mall industry in the US and go directly to 5 Largest Shopping Malls in the United States.The State of the Mall IndustryThe shopping-mall industry in the US grew exponentially from the 50s as suburban life took hold of the country, raising the demand for local shopping centers. Fast-forward to the 21st century, the Internet ushered the US into the age of online shopping, where you can find and buy pretty much whatever you want from the comfort of your couch. This has led to a decline in the shopping-mall appeal. The decline was accelerated during the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 when online shopping grew by 43% according to the US Census Bureau. While shopping malls are still one of the major players in the US retail market, online shopping is projected to account for a third of all retail shopping by 2030, per Kearney, a global management consulting firm. On the other hand, The mall vacancy rate has risen to 8.3% as of Q4 2021, according to data from Statista. This has left the mall REITs with the choice to either evolve or die out. Rate-Hike OnslaughtTo make matters worse, rising interest rates in the US to counter inflation are expected to drive many retailers out of business. Rate hikes are making it harder for consumers to spend money, which is driving the demand for retail goods down. In addition, many retailers had tapped into revolving credit facilities in 2020 to stay in business during lockdowns. The amount these companies borrowed accounted for $145 billion of the $252 billion of total credit, and a significant portion of this amount was variable-rate debt, which is expected to be paid back in the next five years. This means that many retailers would be paying their debt with rising interest rates, at a time when consumers are shopping less. It represents a real risk of driving many retailers out of business, which is further expected to increase the mall vacancy rate through the next five years. Additionally, it’ll make it harder for the survivors to expand their presence in shopping malls. Story continuesFuture of Shopping MallsThe situation on the ground doesn’t look good for shopping mall REITs, but there are ways around irrelevance in the long-term future. According to a Reuters report, Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), the biggest mall-owning REIT in the US, is in talks with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to turn its vacant Sears and J.C. Penney stores into fulfillment centers. Many other shopping malls in North America and Europe are turning towards logistics as the answer to their decreasing revenue in retail. Apart from rising demand for warehouses, logistics also carries financial benefits. The space for retail costs on average $20 per square foot, while the same for warehouse space is only $6.5.Another way the shopping-malls are adapting is by moving more and more towards facilities that are experience-oriented, like event organization, art galleries, cinemas and museums.Now that we know the state of the mall industry, let’s head towards the list of 25 largest shopping malls in the United States.25 Largest Shopping Malls in the United StatesOur MethodologyFor our list of the 25 largest shopping malls in the United States, we’ve ranked them based on their total retail space in square feet.

Airlines certified under IEnvA standards will also be ISO 14001 certified.Operating sustainably in our facilitiesAs part of our goal to source 2.5 million GJs of costcompetitive renewable energy to power our operations by 2025, we purchased nearly 750,000 GJs of electricity from renewable sources for our headquarters facilities and operations at DFW in 2021. In the past year, these facilities were 100% powered by renewable energy. As of January 2022, American was the highest-ranked transportation company - and 53rd overall - on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Green Power Partnership Fortune 500® Partners List.(4)We also have multiple LEED Gold- and Silver-certified facilities across the United States, including two LEED Gold-certified buildings at our corporate headquarters campus that we opened in 2019.Reducing environmental impacts on boardAmerican has a number of longtime efforts aimed at reducing waste and increasing recycling on board our aircraft. Among them, American recycles an average of about 21,000 pounds of aluminum cans annually through our flight services.Story continuesWe are also taking steps to use more sustainable materials - and, in particular, to find ways to reduce single-use plastics - as part of our onboard products and meal service. While adjustments made in response to COVID-19 presented challenges in advancing some of our sustainable materials goals - such as providing bottles of water rather than refilling cups to minimize contact - we have tested a number of new products over the past two years that we are aiming to roll out more broadly.For example, in 2021 we piloted a sustainable cutlery kit made out of bamboo. We also began offering a sustainable meal box, which is a fully compostable box with prepack aged snacks, across our regional operations. In addition, we introduced new onboard amenity kits for premium cabin customers in partnership with Shinola and D.S. &amp; Durga, which include a number of sustainability features. For example, the dental kit and ear plugs are individually packaged within a biodegradable wax paper instead of single-use plastic, and the toothbrush is made from wheat straw instead of plastic.Alongside these onboard efforts, we have instituted a number of sustainability improvements in our lounges. They include switching from plastic to compostable flatware and straws, installing water bottle filler stations, testing reusable to-go bags and more.Reducing Aircraft NoiseWe recognize and are committed to addressing the ongoing concerns of local communities regarding aircraft noise. One way we have done this over the past few years is by voluntarily retrofitting our aircraft with fuel vent vortex generators (VGs). These fairings are installed around the wing fuel tank over the pressure vent, on the underside of the wing of the A320 family of aircraft. These vents reduce airframe noise during portions of the approach by an estimated four to six decibels. Prior to 2014 deliveries, Airbus did not equip aircraft with VGs - so American has invested over $1 million to retrofit our pre-2014 aircraft with this feature.By April 2022, we had modified 290 narrowbody pre-2014 aircraft with retrofit VGs, meaning all Airbus aircraft in our fleet now have the VGs utility.We also continue to meet or exceed ICAO noise certification standards, which currently specify that operators can fly Stage 3, Stage 4 or Stage 5 aircraft. All of American's mainline and regional fleet meet Stage 4 noise certification levels, and 20% meet Stage 5 noise certification levels.(4) https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-04/fortune500_jan2022.pdfRead moreAmerican Airlines, Wednesday, December 7, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from American Airlines on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: American AirlinesWebsite: profiles/american-airlinesEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: American AirlinesView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/730778/American-Airlines-Sustainable-Operations]"

More than half (53%) of small businesses1 also reported growth, the highest in 2022 and up from 46% in July. More than 70% of large businesses2 reported growth in the most recent October survey.Businesses focus on maintaining benefits and wagesHowever, businesses and employees remain uneasy about economic pressures. Seventy percent of employers and 74% of employees believe it's somewhat or very likely a recession will happen in the next six months; this is up from 65% of employers in July.To address a potential downturn, businesses are choosing to reduce operational expenses or raise prices on goods and services over reducing employee salaries and benefits. Sixty four percent of small businesses said they will not reduce salaries compared to 49% of large businesses. Similarly, 57% of small businesses said they will not reduce benefits to adapt for a recession compared to 45% of large operations. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of employees surveyed reported wage increases within the past year.""If there's one constant in our research of the small and midsize business community, it's that they remain committed to their employees. Earlier this year, businesses said they weren't going to impact benefits or wages, and that sentiment is holding,"" said Amy Friedrich, president of U.S. Insurance Solutions at Principal®. ""While the economic outlook is murky, business owners understand employees are their most valuable asset and they're continuing to support them with retirement and protection solutions, as well as financial wellness programs.""Story continuesEmployee uptake of financial wellness programs increased 70% in the past six months, and 79% said these programs better prepare for retirement.Employees prepare for potential recessionAbout half of employees surveyed indicated they are already reducing discretionary spending to prepare for a potential recession. However, ""decreasing savings for retirement"" is the least likely action employees would take amidst a recession.""Financial wellness tools clearly matter to employees, but building a program is just the start to help employees,"" said Heather Winston, director of financial planning and advice with Retirement &amp; Income Solutions at Principal. ""Employers can help to further support them by communicating the availability of those benefits and encouraging usage.""Recession concerns are having a significant impact on employee mental health, especially among younger generations. More than two-thirds (67%) of employees agree that concerns about a recession have impacted their stress levels or mental health, with Millennials (79%) and Gen Z (76%) more likely to report impacts.""When examining the list of concerns, a disconnect persists between employers and employees,"" said Friedrich. ""While employers are more concerned about economic impacts, employees' concerns focus on personal health and wellbeing. Employers have an opportunity to focus on understanding and meeting employees' needs and addressing them for continued long-term job satisfaction and growth.""See all results and insights from the latest Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM (PDF).1 Businesses with two to 499 employees.2 Businesses with 500 - 10,000 employees.About the Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSMThe Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM surveys business owners, decision makers and business leaders aged 21 and over who work at companies with 2 - 10,000 employees.

In the first pulse of the Well-Being Index in 2022, the employee audience was added to the survey to compare and contrast key sentiment from employers. The survey was commissioned by Principal® and conducted online by Dynata from October 6 - 16, 2022, with a total of 500 business owners, decision makers and business leader participants and a total of 200 employee participants.

Shares have added about 7.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Essential Utilities due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Essential Utilities Q3 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat EstimatesEssential Utilities Inc. reported third-quarter 2022 operating earnings per share (EPS) of 26 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents by 13%. The bottom line also improved from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 19 cents per share by 36.8%.Earnings were driven by customer growth, increased volume in its regulated natural gas segment, increased volume and regulated water rates in its regulated water segment, which were offset by increased expenses and other items.Total RevenuesThird-quarter operating revenues of $435 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $376 million by 15.6%.Total revenues improved 20.1% year over year. The year-over-year improvement in total revenues was due to the recovery of purchased gas costs, customer growth and volume from the regulated water segment.Highlights of the ReleaseEssential Utilities continues to expand operations through acquisitions.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.19%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.01%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.09%.Coming into today, shares of the mining company had gained 8.46% in the past month. In that same time, the Basic Materials sector gained 9.51%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.7%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Freeport-McMoRan as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Freeport-McMoRan is projected to report earnings of $0.35 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 63.54%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.35 billion, down 13.21% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.29 per share and revenue of $22.4 billion. These totals would mark changes of -26.84% and -1.94%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Freeport-McMoRan. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PepsiCo is:51% = US$9.8b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.51 in profit.Does PepsiCo Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, PepsiCo has a better ROE than the average (16%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for PepsiCo.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesPepsiCo's Debt And Its 51% ROEPepsiCo does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.05. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

Comments from a relatively less-hawkish Jerome Powell last week provided the market with much-needed relief, but that euphoric feeling has seemingly faded.Investors will undoubtedly be laser-focused on the upcoming FOMC meeting slated for December 13th – 14th, where the consensus is that the Fed will slow their tightening pace and implement a 50-basis-point rate hike.Amid times of uncertainty and increased volatility, investors stand to benefit from blending in a layer of defense into their portfolios.After all, defense wins ballgames.Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector carry a defensive nature, as these companies’ products have an advantageous ability to generate consistent demand in the face of many economic situations.Three top-ranked stocks from the realm – PepsiCo PEP, The Hershey Company HSY, and General Mills Inc. GIS – could all be considerations for investors looking to heighten their portfolio’s defense.Below is a year-to-date chart illustrating the performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three stocks snapped the overall bearish trend in 2022, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 handily. Let’s take a closer look at each one.The Hershey Company The Hershey Company is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. The company has seen its earnings outlook tick up over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Hershey has been on a blazing-hot earnings streak, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in nine consecutive quarters.Just in its latest release, the chocolate titan penciled in a 4.8% earnings beat paired with a 4.2% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating Hershey’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, the company’s annual dividend yields 1.8%, below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average. Still, growth is apparent – the company has upped its payout five times over the last five years, translating to an 8.2% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, HSY’s growth profile is hard to ignore, with earnings forecasted to climb 15.5% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 8% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 15.3% in FY22 and 6.3% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGeneral Mills Inc. General Mills is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. The company sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).For those that seek income, GIS has that covered – the company’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.5%, just a tick below its Zacks sector average of 2.6%. Further, the company has a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 53% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike HSY, General Mills has been on an impressive earnings streak as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back quarters. In its latest release, GIS penciled in an 11% bottom-line beat paired with a modest 1% sales surprise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCoPepsiCo is a long-established company engaged in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products.Analysts have increased their earnings estimates over the last several months for PEP’s current and next fiscal year, helping push the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUndoubtedly a positive, PepsiCo is a Dividend King, showing an unparalleled commitment to its shareholders through 50+ consecutive years of increased dividend payouts.The company’s annual dividend currently yields 2.5%, with a payout ratio sitting at 69% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWith the market experiencing volatility over the last several sessions, investors could definitely benefit from adding an additional layer of portfolio defense.Companies in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector can provide a higher level of defense, primarily attributed to consistent demand across many economic situations.All three stocks above – PepsiCo PEP, The Hershey Company HSY, and General Mills Inc. GIS – could all be considered for a defensive approach.On top of strong price action in 2022, all three stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank paired with solid dividend payouts.

400,8b521b88-e9ed-39fd-94e2-21a62ed000ed,PEP,2022-12-08,"Brown-Forman (BF.B) Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates, Sales Beat",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brown-forman-bf-b-q2-170005103.html,1670432405,STORY,"['BF-B', 'ABEV', 'KOF', 'PEP']","[Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B) reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales beat the same.Sales also improved year over year, backed by the increased demand for its brands, mainly the resurgence of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, and growth across all geographic clusters. Meanwhile, earnings were affected by soft margin trends resulting from input cost inflation, higher supply-chain costs, and increased compensation and advertising expenses.For the fiscal second quarter, earnings per share (EPS) of 47 cents declined 4% year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. The decline can be attributed to soft margins due to higher input costs, supply-chain headwinds, and increased compensation and advertising expenses, partly offset by sales growth and a lower effective tax rate.Net sales of $1,094 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,089 million. The top line increased 10% year over year on a reported basis. On an organic basis, net sales were up 16% from the prior-year level. Sales benefited from strong consumer demand for its brands and sustained brand investments. BF.B is benefiting from recent acquisitions, product innovation and strategic relationships.For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Brown-Forman’s gross profit amounted to $613 million, improving 4% year over year. On an organic basis, the gross profit rose 13%.Meanwhile, the gross margin contracted 330 basis points (bps) to 56%. The gross margin decline can be attributed to the impact of input cost inflation, elevated costs resulting from supply-chain disruptions and adverse currency rates. These were partly negated by a favorable price/mix and the removal of the EU and the U.K. tariffs on American whiskey.SG&amp;A expenses rose 9% year over year to $180 million and 15% on an organic basis, mainly on higher compensation-related expenses. Advertising expenses increased 16% year over year to $121 million for the fiscal second quarter.On an organic basis, advertising expenses advanced 22%. This was driven by elevated marketing spends in the United States to back the growth of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, Herradura, the launch of the Jack Daniel’s Bonded series and Woodford Reserve.The operating income declined 2% year over year to $313 million on a reported basis. The organic operating income increased 8%. The operating margin contracted 360 bps to 28.7% in the fiscal second quarter.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have risen 1.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 6.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCategory-Wise &amp; Channel-Wise PerformanceFor the first half of fiscal 2023, net sales increased 11% year over year to $2.1 billion and 17% on an organic basis. The rise was mainly driven by broad-based growth across all geographic regions and the Travel Retail channel on strong volume growth and rebuilding of distributor inventories.Net sales for Jack Daniel’s family of brands were up 9% on a reported basis and 17% on an organic basis in the first half of fiscal 2023. The brand’s sales were driven by solid demand and increased prices in emerging markets, developed international markets and the Travel Retail channel.The upside in sales was also driven by the resurgence of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, which reported sales growth of 9% and organic growth of 18%. Higher pricing and the estimated increase in distributor inventories also aided sales.Further, sales benefited from the continued consumer interest in flavor and convenience, which boosted the performance of Jack Daniel’s Ready-to-Drink (RTD), Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire. Innovation contributed to sales growth through the launch of Jack Daniel’s Bonded series.Premium bourbon brands reported sales growth of 39% and organic sales growth of 40% in the fiscal first half, driven by growth in Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, supported by higher volumes in the United States. An estimated rise in distributor inventories due to the easing of glass supply constraints also boosted sales for Woodford Reserve and Old Forester.BF.B’s RTD category reported double-digit sales growth of 14% and organic sales growth of 20%. This was mainly driven by Jack Daniel’s RTDs and New Mix.Jack Daniel’s RTDs/Ready-to-Pours benefited from gains in Australia and Germany, resulting in year-over-year sales growth of 9% and 15% on an organic basis. New Mix reported sales growth of 48% and organic sales growth of 46%, driven by market share gains in the RTD category in Mexico.Brown-Forman’s tequila portfolio reported sales growth of 10% year over year and 11% on an organic basis. This was driven by volume growth in the United States for the el Jimador and Herradura brands.Sales increased 9% on both reported and organic basis for the Herradura brand due to the positive impacts of an estimated increase in distributor inventories as supply constraints eased. el Jimador reported sales growth of 16% year over year and 18% on an organic basis.The company’s overall sales in the United States advanced 11% on a reported and organic basis. The rise was driven by volume gains, a favorable mix and improved pricing across the portfolio. Higher volumes and pricing for Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey were key drivers. These were partly negated by Korbel California Champagne, which witnessed higher pricing and lower volumes.Meanwhile, the developed international market reported sales growth of 3%, with organic sales rising 14%. The improvement can be attributed to strong consumer demand. Volume gains from Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel’s RTDs mainly aided the results.The emerging markets registered 14% net sales growth, whereas organic sales improved 27%. This was backed by the growth of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in Sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil, as well as New Mix in Mexico.Net sales in the Travel Retail channel advanced 60% on a reported basis and 67% on an organic basis due to higher volumes for the majority of the portfolio as travel trends continued to rebound.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowThe company ended the first half of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,087 million and long-term debt of $1,974 million. Its total shareholders’ equity was $3,040 million. As of Oct 31, 2022, BF.B generated $316 million in cash from operating activities.OutlookDespite the ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, management anticipates continued growth for fiscal 2023. Brown-Forman expects strength in its brand portfolio and strong consumer demand and easing supply constraints to aid organic sales growth in fiscal 2023.It anticipates organic sales growth in the high single digits for fiscal 2023 compared with the mid-single-digit growth expected earlier. The company expects the gross margin for fiscal 2023 to be consistent with the first half of fiscal 2023, wherein it reported a decline due to the effects of inflation, supply-chain disruption costs and currency headwinds.Based on the aforementioned assumptions, Brown-Forman expects the organic operating income to increase in the high single digits. The effective tax rate is expected to be 22-23% for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditure is anticipated in the band of $190-$210 million.Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staples sector, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, PepsiCo Inc.

402,9b060063-743d-3f16-ac16-510b138adb64,PEP,2022-12-08,Buy 5 High ROE Stocks as Robust Economy Fuels Rate Hike Fears,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-5-high-roe-stocks-124412089.html,1670417052,STORY,"['R', 'CNHI', 'AES', 'PEP', 'AESC', 'AGNCP']","[The U.S. equity markets declined in the past few trading sessions as higher-than-expected November ISM data and solid nonfarm payrolls data portrayed signs of a resilient economy that fueled speculations that more interest rate hikes are just around the corner. The Services PMI registered a 56.5 reading in November, indicating an accelerated growth from October’s reading of 54.4. The latest labor market data further showed that payrolls rose by 263,000 in November compared to broad-based expectations of a 200,000 increase. In addition, average hourly earnings improved 0.6% compared with the prior month and 5.1% year over year, as the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.All these economic indicators signified that the overall economy was comparatively better placed for the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against inflation, putting the brakes on a short-term rally witnessed earlier. The markets widely expect that the central bank will likely raise interest rates by a 0.5 percentage point after four successive 75 basis point increases. This, in turn, could put the terminal rate in excess of 5% from its current target range of 3.75-4%.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Ryder System, Inc. R, AGNC Investment Corp. AGNC, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI and The AES Corporation AES are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen:PepsiCo: Headquartered in Purchase, NY, PepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies.

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals peKeen to find out how analysts think Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the market for P/E ratios like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 24%. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 155% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 7.1% per year over the next three years. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 9.0% per year.In light of this, it's somewhat alarming that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as these declining earnings are likely to weigh on the share price eventually.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Our examination of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings are unlikely to support a more positive sentiment for long.

(NASDAQ:CSCO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 3.1% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 13% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Cisco Systems which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cisco Systems. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Cisco Systems. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cisco Systems' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Cisco Systems is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.4% and 4.4% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Cisco Systems, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$50m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cisco Systems. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Cisco Systems better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.
