Now let me turn it over to Ron."", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As I reflect on 2023, the operating environment was dynamic with a complex set of challenges for the world's investors and for our industry, and I'm proud of how we carefully navigated State Street for various headwinds while continuing to execute against our strategic agenda.We focused and delivered on that agenda in 3 key areas: achieved strong sales wins across our businesses, drive strategic change in our Investment Services business, and remained disciplined on productivity and broader cost management. Further on that last point, during 2023, we implemented key productivity actions and announced additional efficiency measures that will enable us to enhance the productivity of our operating model in 2024 and the years ahead.We took these many actions, all while investing in our business and returning substantial capital to our shareholders, which helped to drive full year earnings growth, excluding notable items. The world's investors, State Street and our industry faced a host of significant market events and macroeconomic forces in 2023.In the first quarter, turmoil in the banking sector ultimately led to the resolution of several banks, which was a catalyst for some of the largest fixed income market move seen in decades.In the second quarter, anticipation grew about the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence, helping to drive equity markets higher. However, as we progressed into the third quarter as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to the highest level in 22 years in July, the prospect of higher for longer rates led to a substantial selloff in bond markets with the U.S. 10-year treasury yield exceeding 5% in October for the first time since the global financial crisis.Rate uncertainty and an increasing number of geopolitical concerns cause equities to struggle. Then during the fourth quarter, the equity market rallied vigorously as inflation receded and investors grew increasingly optimistic about a soft landing with positive sentiment gaining further momentum in the last month as the Federal Reserve signaled pivot to lower interest rates this year.In sum, while our full year overall financial results benefited from higher interest rates globally last year and despite the strong market appreciation in the fourth quarter, daily average global equity markets only increased by low single digits in 2023, providing just a modest tailwind to our fee revenue, while client activity was muted as investors stayed on the sidelines for much of the year. And even in such an eventful year, equity and FX market volatility continued to contract, creating revenue headwinds for our trading businesses.Slide 3 of our investor presentation provides some of our highlights for the year. Beginning with our financial performance, full year earnings per share was $5.58 or $7.66 excluding notable items. Year-over-year, excluding notable items, EPS growth was supported by $3.8 billion of common share repurchases, a record level of NII, continued growth of our front office software and data business, and higher securities finance revenues, the combination of which more than offset the impact of lower servicing and management fees and underlying expense growth, which was still well controlled.We continue to build business momentum and position State Street in longer term success. To that end, we achieved a number of important accomplishments in 2023, as you can see on Slide 3. A key highlight of today's results is the clear progress we are making on innovation and advancing product capabilities, which in turn contributes to stronger sales momentum across our broad franchise aimed at generating better fee revenue growth in the year ahead.Within the Investment Services business, we are intensely focused on ensuring better execution against our strategy and revenue goals. We unveiled the sharpened execution plan last year, underpinned by a number of measurable actions aimed at driving servicing opportunities across key regions and product areas, realizing the full potential of our Alpha value proposition and accelerating sales and revenue growth particularly in our core back-office custody.Encouragingly, as I just noted, today's results demonstrate our proven ability to deliver the level of sales required for attractive organic servicing fee revenue growth in the future as we built upon the $91 million of new servicing fee sales in the third quarter by recording $103 million of new servicing fee wins in 4Q, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in recent years.From its inception, we have noted that Alpha will further establish broaden and deepen client relationships, positioning State Street as our clients' essential partner. Alpha distinctively enables us to grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capability as a true one State Street solution for our clients from front to back. 2023 was an important year for Alpha software delivery. The last 2 quarters of the year included the significant development of the fixed income portfolio management module, which propels CRD and Alpha capabilities and competitiveness forward.In 3Q, we recorded our first Alpha for private markets client. And in the fourth quarter, we continued Alpha's momentum by deepening relationships with a number of key existing mandates and recording 4 new Alpha wins, while our front office software and data business had a record quarter of new bookings in 4Q, both demonstrating our ability to drive stronger sales.Within our Global Markets business, even as low volatility created a headwind, we continue to see proof points of our very strong market position. For example, in its 2023 FX awards, Euromoney Magazine named State Street as the winner across 4 important categories, including the best FX bank for real money clients. We also continued to innovate and strategically expand our product capabilities and geographic reach including the planned acquisition of outsourced trading from CF Global Trading.At Global Advisors, we undertook targeted strategic actions aimed at gaining market share and driving growth in the coming years. As a result, we saw encouraging business momentum with GA setting a number of growth records in 2023. A number of key performance indicators make us optimistic as we look ahead. For example, in Q4, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate total flows, including record quarterly flows within our SPDR ETF franchise, amounting to a capture of 21% of total global ETF flows in Q4 and ending 2023 with a record level of total ETF assets under management.Our cash business had an exceptional year, delivering record annual flows in 2023 with institutional money market fund AUM also reaching a record. Overall, we gained market share in a number of key areas, including institutional money market funds and U.S. low-cost equity and fixed income, ETFs.Turning to our efficiency and productivity efforts underlying expense growth was well controlled in 2023 with full year expenses increasing 3%, excluding notable items. Q4 expenses, excluding notable items, rose just 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of our ongoing expense actions. Transforming our operations to improve effectiveness and efficiency and realized productivity growth remains a key priority for us. To that end, we announced important steps in our multiyear productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model.As we previously announced, we are streamlining our operations in India. We have now assumed control of of our joint ventures in that country with a second joint venture consolidation expected to close in the spring. We expect these actions will accelerate the transformation of State Street's global operations, improve service quality and client experience and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024.Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our fourth quarter financial highlights and business momentum indicators, which Eric will shortly take you through in more detail. Before I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength, which has enabled us to return a substantial amount of excess capital in recent quarters. For example, over the last 5 quarters to the end of December, we have returned $6.4 billion of capital to our shareholders.As we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return, in 2024, it is currently our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions.Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common share purchase program of up to $5 billion with no set expiration date.To conclude, while 2023 was an eventful year, we finished strongly in 4Q, which creates an encouraging starting point for our businesses into 2024. This year we remained highly focused on both the execution of our strategy and the accountability for results. Our goals are clear. We must continue the improvement in our sales performance that we demonstrated in the second half of 2023, and continue to implement a set of productivity initiatives and product enhancements that will drive longer-term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024, all while returning capital to our shareholders. We are laser-focused on these goals.Now let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail."", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, let me briefly discuss the notable items we recognized in the quarter on Slide 5, which collectively totaled $620 million pretax or $1.49 of EPS.First, we recognized an FDIC special assessment of $387 million, which is reflected in other expenses. Second, we recognized $203 million of net repositioning charges to enable the next phase of our productivity program. As we had indicated in December, the bulk of this action primarily relates to the severance of around 1,500 employees. Our initiative to streamline and delayer our operations, technology and staff functions and improve efficiency will allow us to sustainably reduce expenses.We expect these actions collectively to have a payback of roughly 6 quarters and begin this quarter with roughly 2/3 of the benefit occurring in 2024. These actions and the related savings will contribute to our fee operating leverage goal for 2024 and in subsequent years.Turning to Slide 6. I will begin my review both our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As you can see on the table, total fee revenue was flattish for all periods of comparison quarter-on-quarter, the year-on-year quarter and for the full year. The slight market appreciation notwithstanding the combination of muted volatility, central bank pivots and geopolitical concerns pushed investors to the sidelines for much of the year.In terms of our more durable revenues, we continue to benefit from strong momentum in our front office software and data business, which was up 5% on a full year basis and 13% on the year-on-year quarter. In terms of areas that have begun to rebound, management fee performance was down for the full year at minus 3%, but has begun to rebound with an up 5% result for the year-on-year quarter as flows picked up, and we gained share.Back-office servicing fees was challenged for much for the year as the client transactional activity was muted, but has started to turn positive and is up 1% this quarter as we've seen a recent lift in equity markets. And of course, we continue to be affected by industry-wide headwinds in our Global Markets businesses given the low levels of volatility in the FX markets and special activity in agency lending throughout the year.NII has been tough to predict and surprised to the positive this quarter compared to third quarter. I'll turn to that in a few minutes. Expenses were well controlled in the quarter as we continue to thoughtfully allocate resources across the franchise and to areas where we see the greatest opportunities for top line growth.Relative to a year ago, total expenses ex notables were up 2% year-on-year and reflect intensifying cost management in a tough environment as the year progressed. This expense control, coupled with the repositioning actions I just mentioned, prepare us to deliver productivity savings and positive fee operating leverage in 2024.Finally, despite a dynamic and challenging operating environment, we delivered full year 2023 EPS growth of 3%, excluding notable items. This was supported by share repurchases, a record level of NII and the growth of our front office software and data business, which is less exposed to macroeconomic conditions.Turning now to Slide 7. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 14% on a year-on-year basis and 4% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels. At Global Advisors, period-end AUM increased 19% year-on-year and was up 12% sequentially, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and strong net inflows.Notably, as Ron mentioned earlier, and I'll describe momentarily, in fourth quarter, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate net flows of $103 billion, which sets us up well for 2024. At the center right, we've also added a table with market volatility indices, which we believe can be useful indicators of plying transactional activity that drives servicing fees, specials activity and agency lending and flows and margins in FX trading.On Slide 8 now. On the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, partially offset by pricing headwinds, lower client activity and adjustments in a previously disclosed client transition. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2%, primarily as a result of the pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed net client transition partially offset by higher client activity and adjustments, which was nice to see as clients started to come off the sidelines.On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. We were quite pleased to see new servicing fee revenue wins of $103 million this quarter, the highest in many recent years, primarily reflecting the enhancements of our sales processes and product offerings, including in North America, where we saw strong outcomes after a period of underperformance. These servicing wins contributed to the total full year fee revenue wins of $301 million and underscores the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance. Recall, our goal for 2024 is even higher at $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee sales for the year.Finally, we had $270 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end, up $57 million year-on-year and $15 million quarter-on-quarter. We expect about half of this to install in 2024. We also had $2.3 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end.Turning to Slide 9. Fourth quarter management fees were $479 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and some performance fees partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impact of a strategic product suite repricing initiative that has aided ETF flows.Relative to the third quarter, management fees were flat, mainly driven by higher performance fees, offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impact of the strategic ETF product suite repricing initiative.As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, we had record quarterly net inflows of $68 billion, driven by record net inflows into SPY as well as the SPDR portfolio U.S. low-cost suite, experiencing consistent market share gains. In our Institutional business, we saw quarterly net flows of $6 billion, primarily driven by defined contribution products.And lastly, across our cash franchise, we saw quarterly cash net inflows of $29 billion primarily into money market funds, which contributed to the record total full year 2023 cash net inflows of $76 billion, and institutional money market fund market share gains.Turning now to Slide 10. Fourth quarter FX Trading Services revenue was down 11% year-on-year ex notables and 2% sequentially, relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower FX spreads from muted market volatility, offset by slightly higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the decrease primarily reflects lower direct FX revenues from muted volatility.Fourth quarter securities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower agency balances, partially offset by higher agency spreads, higher specials activity and prime services revenue. Moving on to Software and Processing revenues. Fourth quarter fees were up 10% year-on-year and 26% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly.Finally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $15 million year-on-year, primarily due to a midyear tax credit investment accounting change, partially offset by the impacts associated with the devaluation of the Argentinian peso.Moving to Slide 11. You'll see on the left panel that fourth quarter Front Office Software and Data revenue increased 13% year-on-year, primarily as a result of the continued SaaS implementations and conversions driving software-enabled and professional services revenue growth. Sequentially, Front Office Software and Data revenue was up 38%, primarily driven by higher on-premise renewals and go-live implementations.Turning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel. We were pleased to report 4 more Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, which means 7 wins for the full year 2023. State Street Alpha continues to be an important differentiator of our business and creates an attractive value proposition for our clients with contractual terms usually covering 5 to 7 to 10 years.We've also gone live with 3 more Alpha clients, which brings us to 6 for the year, which sets us up well for 2024 and added significant new functionality for fixed income portfolio managers. Fourth quarter ARR increased 16% year-over-year driven by 20-plus SaaS client implementations and conversions and we had a record quarter for front office new bookings at $32 million.Turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII increased 14% year-on-year but increased 9% sequentially to $678 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to lower average deposit balances and deposit mix shift, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by the impact of interest rates and the full quarter impact of the third quarter investment portfolio repositioning as well as higher deposits and loan balances.The NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected as both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits increased and certain client repricings were further delayed. Some of the higher deposit balances may have been seasonal, but the Fed's quantitative tightening appears to have been offset by the reduction of the Fed reverse repo operation, which seems to have resulted in inclines having higher bank deposit balances.It's hard to know how deposits will trend, but we're pleased with this higher step off going into the first quarter of 2024. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Average deposits increased 4% quarter-on-quarter with noninterest-bearing deposits up 3% for the quarter.Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 2% year-on-year or 1% ex FX. Sequentially, fourth quarter expenses were up only 1% as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, core custody and tech and ops process improvements in automation. On a line-by-line basis and year-over-year ex notables, compensation and employee benefits increased 1%, primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by lower contractor spend in performance-based incentive comp. Information systems and communications expenses increased 4% mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and vendor credits.Transaction processing increased 1%, mainly reflecting higher brokerage costs. Occupancy increased 24%, largely due to the absence of an episodic sale-leaseback transaction in the prior period. And other expenses were up 3% sequentially, flat year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher marketing expense and professional fees.Lastly, let me spend a moment on headcount. As we discussed in the third quarter, as part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we've streamlined our operating model in India and have now assumed full ownership of one of our operations, joint ventures and we recently announced that we intend a similar undertaking with a second consolidation in the country this spring.This consolidation continues the transformation of State Street's global operations and will enable us to unlock productivity savings, which we expect to start this quarter through a reduction in contract services and in the years ahead, as we simplify our fragmented operating model. As you would expect, consolidating the first joint venture increased our FTE headcount roughly 4,400 in the quarter as we in-source global capabilities. However, these costs were already in our expense base and reported historically under the comp and benefits line.These actions are contributing to our higher productivity savings targets for 2024.Moving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which came in above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.6% was up 60 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by episodically lower RWA and improvement in AOCI, partially offset by the continuation of common share repurchases.The decrease in interest rates during December after the completion of our buyback contributed about 20 basis points to our CET1 ratios and some market factors over the last week of December conveniently contributed roughly another 50 basis points to the RWA end-of-period print.Going forward, I would expect the RWA to run at higher levels to support our various businesses. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 106% and 122% for State Street Bank & Trust. In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return over $700 million to shareholders, consisting of $500 million of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as we announced earlier today, our Board authorized a new multiyear common equity repurchase program of up to $5 billion with no expiration date.Turning to Slide 15. Before I start, let me first share some of the assumptions and underlying our current views for the full year. Let me cover our full year 2024 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have more potential for variability than usual, given the macroeconomic environment we're operating in.In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect global equity markets to be flat point-to-point in 2024, which equates to the daily average being up about 10% year-over-year. Our interest rate outlook for 2024 largely aligned with the forward curve as of year-end 2023, which I would note continues to move.We expect to see modest increase in FX and equity volatility, which should support slightly higher FX trading services fees this year, but we are still seeing muted volatility in the first quarter. And we expect currency translation to have less than 0.5 percentage point impact on revenues and expenses due to dollar depreciation, and I would remind you that a weaker U.S. dollar has a favorable impact on revenues and an unfavorable impact on expenses.So we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be up approximately 3% to 4% ex notable items with servicing fee and management fee growth driven by them and continued strong growth in Front Office Software and Data. This includes a headwind of a little less than 1 percentage point to fee growth from the expected previously disclosed client transition.Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we currently expect fee revenue to be up 2% on a year-over-year basis, with servicing fees expected to be up 1%, management fees up 7% to 8%, and front office software and data expected to be up over 20%, largely due to increased SaaS, new business and conversions and on-premise renewals. We expect full year 2024 NII to be down about 10% on a year-over-year basis compared to a record 2023. This is dependent on the outcome of global rate cuts and deposit mix and levels, which are obviously difficult to predict.Regarding the first quarter of 2024, after a significant step-up in 4Q '23, we expect 1Q 24 NII to be flat to down 3% on a sequential quarter basis given current deposit mix expectations.Turning to expenses. As you can see on the walk on Page 16, we expect full year expenses ex notables will be up about 2.5% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven largely by our continued investment in the business, which we expect to largely offset through greater productivity savings worth $0.5 billion, which is approximately 1.7x last year's gross savings level.Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we expect expenses ex notable items to be up 1% to 1.5% on a year-over-year basis keeping in mind the seasonal expenses usually occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, we expect to achieve positive fee operating leverage, excluding notable items for full year 2024, given the projected growth in fee revenue and well-controlled expenses.Finally, we expect taxes should be in the 21%, 22% range for 2024. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron."", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', 'Thank you, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.', 'Alexander Blostein', ""Thanks for all the details. I was hoping we could start with unpacking some of the NII dynamics, and I guess I appreciate the uncertainty when it comes to deposits. But Eric, maybe talk a little bit about what drove the upside in the fourth quarter in deposit levels? And if you have a view on what sort of seasonal versus more kind of core client franchise driven and maybe give us some insight on where you expect balances to ultimately stabilize in the back half of '24."", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Sure, Alex. It's Eric. Let me share with you the texture we have, but I'll just say deposits and deposit levels continue to be volatile. They surprised to the upside. And in particular, we saw a nice uptick in deposits into September, October, we actually saw on the NIB side a downtick in November and then a large, I think, again in December.So the averages came in up for the quarter, which made a big difference. $1 billion of NIB for a month is worth $5 million and you kind of multiply through. And that quickly adds up as we had a spread in December of $5 billion, $6 billion relative to our expectations. And at the same time, we also saw interest-bearing deposits up. Now some of that is just our regular way engagement with clients. Some of that is there leaving more deposits with us. And I think you did see in the Fed reports, the banking system deposits are up 1%, 2% quarter-on-quarter from third quarter to fourth quarter. So it does seem like there's something happening in the market that's creating a little more stability, a little bit of buoyancy. There's some amount of seasonality that we always tend to see in -- at the end of the year as folks accumulate cash, sometimes to pay dividends and ETFs in the next year.So it's just hard to read, but that's what played out. And it played out better through the quarter and through the end. If I then try to look forward, it's very hard to look forward for the year. We'd like to operate and expect to operate in the deposit range of $200 billion to $210 billion. That's our kind of goal. A lot of that is just client engagement and helping put their cash to work. And sometimes they put cash to work in deposits, in repo, in money market sweeps. But there's a category -- each one of those is an important category and outlet for clients. And what we're seeing is clients using all the -- I'll call it, all the above, right, including just holding treasury securities. So that we expect to continue, and we think deposits will be roughly in the zone in the first quarter.What's a little harder to read is just how noninterest-bearing deposits play out. We do expect those to continue to flow downward. They tend to flow downward for our clients with the largest funds, those are the ones that have been floating down over the last 2 years. So we continue to see that expectation. There continues to be a little bit of repricing that plays out into the first quarter or 2 as well. And that's why I guided on an NII basis to flat to down 3% for the first quarter, just to give you a little bit of an indication, but we expect that to be roughly on flattish deposits."", 'Alexander Blostein', ""Got it. Very helpful. My follow-up, sticking with deposits is around just deposit beta as we start to sort of enter the rate cutting cycle. So hoping you could articulate maybe what you're assuming for deposit beta on the way down in your '24 NII guidance? And then broadly, how we should think about sort of the cadence of deposit betas as we progress through the rate cutting cycle into the back half '24, '25 maybe. But just curious to know kind of high or the upper at the beginning lower towards the end or the opposite?"", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Alex, it's an important topic because it's how we interact with our clients. It's how we price our products. It's how the industry has operated in for many years. I think you know that our deposit betas on a cumulative basis have climbed quite a bit in the U.S. They're 75% or so cumulatively since the start of the cycle. In euros, it's around 60% cumulatively in pound sterling, closer to the 30% to 35%. So they're clearly moved up.What certainly happens as, and I'll say when, if and when rates fall, is the deposits beta is reverse. There's some amount of symmetry. Now they reverse instantaneously. We want to be careful with our clients. We want to be fair. But we do think that over multiple quarters and certainly over any realistic time frame, the Fed cuts, and there's got to be an adjustment. Now part of that happens because we have a good bit of our deposits that are indexed to market. right? They're indexed to market indicators. There are quite a few that are indexed with a spread. And then there are a small amount now that has a transactional kind of, I'll call it, administered feature. But you'll generally see a broad amount of symmetry in deposits down versus up. I think what you do need to keep in mind is that our asset sensitivity and liability sensitivity, though, are somewhat different between the international markets and in the U.S., right? In international markets, because those cumulative betas are still in the 30% to 60% range. We're still asset sensitive. So we make more money with increases in rates. And we actually -- NII will trim down with decreases in rates. And that's where we're most -- that's our interest rate sensitivity today.On the U.S., we have a slight positive bias towards being liability-sensitive, but it's still relatively slight. I'd almost call it neutral. So part of what we're doing is just navigating this interest rate environment. It's not exactly clear when the rates come. It's not clear whether the U.S. cuts before Europe or vice versa. And part of what we'll do is actively manage our portfolio to try to take advantage of what's coming. At the same time, we'll price our deposits fairly and prudently."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.', 'Brennan Hawken', ""I think maybe some of what you just said on the non-U.S. side might explain this. But when we think about triangulating the minus 10% to the fact that 1Q is either going to be flat, totally down a little on NII, it sort of suggests that your exit rate by the time you get to the 4Q '24 based on what you can see today, it's probably going to be rather low. Am I reading correctly in thinking that it's that non-U.S. piece? And that's going to drive some of that weakness. And am I extrapolating the comments correctly to think that we could see a little bit more back-end weighted decline for NII."", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Brennan, it's Eric. I think you've got the right general pattern framed in the area of NII. Clearly, we have a very strong step off in particular, in December, but in the fourth quarter, which will flow into first quarter. And then we expect a trending down. We had a couple of -- well, probably earlier this -- earlier last year, so a couple of quarters ago, I described an NII range of $550 million to $600 million. And we think we'll get into that range, the top end of that range by around the third quarter. But it's a little bit hard to know the exact shape. We just -- but you've got the right direction of travel.And then we expect some stabilization in the second half of next year, maybe around the top half, the middle half of that range, just really hard to tell exactly where and when. If you step back and ask, what are the underlying drivers? There are really 3 drivers that continue to be important. In terms of tailwinds, we continue to have long rates playing through the portfolio and the investment portfolio balances as the as they recoupon at higher rates, that's particularly important in the first half of the year, a little less so in the second half of the year, but that continues through as a positive.You then have, as you mentioned, short rates starting to come down. And because of our sensitivity position across the global markets, that does start to have a headwind impact on NII as those cuts continue to come through. Now we'll see what's the pattern and pace of U.S. versus international cuts. And I think right now, we've pegged to the forward, which shows a lot of consistency in symmetry, but we'll see if that really happens because you can see inflation expectations keep moving around literally daily, weekly.And then the third feature is just client deposits. It's a mix. And while we expect client deposits to be in that zone of $200 million, $210 million, they might bump up above that, a little below that, but they'll be in that broad zone. The mix will continue to shave down out of noninterest bearing over the next quarter or two, we think, it's hard to, again, to predict and then there's -- we're working through the final stages of some of our interest-bearing deposit, repricing those seem to have taken a little longer in some cases than we expected. That's okay. That means we accrete income. But those continue to come through and they'll play through in the first quarter or two as well. And then that's what kind of brings us to some level of reasonable stability in the back half of the year."", 'Brennan Hawken', ""Eric. It's very, very helpful. And by the way, I apologize for the background noise that is here. Second question, a bit more strategic. So we saw a flurry of Bitcoin ETF launches here recently. It didn't seem like you all actually landed any of those servicing opportunities. So I want to confirm whether my early read on that is right. And given the magnitude of the investment and the focus you've made on digital assets, what did you learn if you guys missed on that? And is that what led to the restructuring of the digital asset group? And what should we see as a change from that restructuring?"", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""So Brennan, there were 11 launched on the day that the -- or day after the SEC gave approval, and we actually service 3 of them. And I think we're the only ones that servicing across 3 different digital custodians. So we helped 3 of the major players make this happen. So we're quite active in the space. And as you'd expect, we do everything for each of those 3 except for the actual custody for the reasons that I think you know.So no, we're very active in the space. It was -- what did we learn? I mean it's early. What I think everybody is watching out for is there's a lot of players that went into the market, some of them with some existing high levels of assets. What will be interesting to see over time is, does it actually consolidate? How does it work in terms of the -- who the buyers are institutional versus retail versus intermediary, but these are early days. And it was good to get the uncertainty cleared up. And for all this to get launched, and we're keen to be part of it."", 'Brennan Hawken', 'Yes. Ron, thanks for clarifying pure custody versus the servicing, Very, very helpful.', 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Yes. And just to clarify, it's -- I mean, I think everybody knows this. But I mean, right now, it's extremely difficult for a bank to do pure custody because of the capital requirements that are imposed on a bank. I mean it's basically 100% capital. So therefore, virtually everybody is working with some kind of digital custodian, a non-bank digital custodian, but all of the other parts of the ecosystem, which we're quite familiar with, we are participating in."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.', 'Glenn Paul Schorr', ""So big flows in SSGA, which is great to see these things are unpredictable, but I am curious on if you had any thoughts towards sustainability, maybe it would be the color of what clients are buying, what clients, I mean, I'm sorry, what flavors of ETF are they? The average fee? And what you're specifically doing differently on the distribution front and education front to get at those flows?"", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""Yes. So there are a number of things going on there in the fourth quarter, Glenn, and throughout 2023. I think as we've noted, and certainly, you all would have observed, there was -- it was most of the year with some episodic exceptions, it was a risk-off environment that changed in fourth quarter somewhat as predicted once investors got a sense of where interest rates were going. As they did when the Fed communicated in the third quarter more or less a pause. I think that started activity going. So, much of the activity late in the year would have been the kind of classic risk on, let's put positions on quickly, benefiting the highly liquid SPDR Core, SPY in the sector ETFs. But underlying it and throughout the year, the low-cost ETFs, which represent different investors, these would be -- the ultimate holders here tend to be individuals. They're often advised by an intermediary like an RIA. So the -- it's very sticky. And we have continued to build share there, both in equity and fixed income, low cost.Across the board, fixed income is seeing a dramatic growth. I think there's increasing acceptance, both by retail investors and institutional investors that the ETF is a good vehicle to hold fixed income and you're just seeing that asset allocation moving that way.And then finally, active ETFs of all sort, you're seeing growth in. And it's been a long time coming. As you know, it's been over a decade on how is this actually going to play out. And it's ironic how it's playing out and that everybody is just taking their standard investment strategy and putting it in active ETF. We benefit some of that on the GA side in terms of what they're doing in fixed income, but we benefit from it greatly on the servicing side because we're very, very, not to overuse the word, active in the active ETF servicing space. And we believe you'll see a lot more growth there as core funds and core offerings of well known asset managers either get converted to ETFs or launch those ETFs.So we're really pleased on the GA side. In terms of what drove it, I think it was the next part of your question, I mean, part of it was much more focused and resources dedicated to the various intermediary channels. I mean we -- our roots are in the institutional channels, but the lots of the growth is in the intermediary channel. So that's part of it. And then as we talked about, I believe, last quarter, we took a hard look at pricing, particularly in the so-called low-cost ETFs and recognizing their durability felt that it was worth the investment to reprice them to continue to gain market share because they tend to be very, very sticky."", 'Glenn Paul Schorr', ""That's a lot of detail. It's perfect. I appreciate it. I'll go quickly on the follow-up. It's the same question just different on the servicing front, happy with the wins you noted. Maybe we could just drill down. I know it's not huge yet, but the private markets piece of the servicing wins. I'm curious if you want to tell us how much it was. But more importantly, what it is and how -- is it one client? Or is it multiple times, I'm curious on how that premarket servicing space is developing."", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""No, no, it's both. To answer the last part of it first, Glenn, it's certainly not 1 client. I mean, this is a space that we've invested in, and we're well known in. And we see a secular trend here. where it's -- so many of these operations are held inside, firms are highly bespoke often sitting in very expensive locations. And as the product sets have become more complicated, I mean, it's following a path that the active long-only industry followed 10, 15 years ago. I was trying to do all this stuff inside when it was just a couple of products, they are fairly straightforward. That's not what's happening now. Products are more complicated. As you start to think about the structures that enable high net worth individuals to participate in it, you've got that added complexity. And then oftentimes, there's side investments that are permitted, et cetera. So it's very complicated.It lends itself to outsourcing. It's still very much an in-sourced business. So we see lots of potential growth in it. It's fee characteristics are different. Positive in the sense that the fees are higher, but also the fees get fully recognized when the fund is fully invested. So part that we pay a lot of attention to is what's the expected actual, one, money raised and then draw down? And how do we do our best to match our expenses to that? But we're very excited about the business.Much of the new investment product investment that Eric talked about in the 2024 guide includes further strengthening of our position there. There's innovation in there and we -- our goal is to continue to set moats around us so we can continue to excel at it."", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""And Glenn, it's Eric. I'd just add private has been a real strong area of growth for us. We've described it as up 10%, 15% in different quarters. So it's a big part of our growth agenda as we -- this past year. And then this coming year as we take our sales goals up, the $350 million to $400 million at least 1/4 of that plus is going to be around private, and that's what's going to help us continue to drive private growth. We think in the 15%-plus range in terms of year-on-year revenues. So it's an area that I think we've actually broadly with both large and small and midsize. It's actually well distributed, and it's got a good mix of U.S., Europe and Asia sales coming through as well."", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""Yes, as well as, Glenn, it's not just private equity, it's private equity adventure. -- private credit is booming. And for every bank that complaints about what's going to happen with regulation and the fact that it's pushing activity out of the banking system that's going right into the private credit area, and we should be the beneficiary of that growth."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.', 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Eric, can you share with us -- I know you run more in the State Street 10 years ago. But your comments about the net interest income outlook and just how volatile it is due to what's going on in the bond market with the Federal Reserve and their balance sheet. Are there any indicators, you're monitoring that we could look at that might be able to give us a better insight to when net interest income for State Street might be more predictable on a go-forward basis?"", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Gerard, it's Eric. I take a sigh when I think about this question. I think the predictability is partly around Fed actions, right? This is the highest rate level that we've seen in 22 years. And also the -- if I go back couple of years, the lowest rate level we've probably seen in 2 decades as well, right? So we've kind of -- we're at these wide bookends relative to really the -- since the -- I want to say the turn of the century, right? That's really created this volatility.Can we manage that and mitigate? Well, we do try to sustain on a regular basis, match off deposit, deposit tenor, rate characteristics with the asset side of the portfolio, and we do that with duration. The challenge is if you take too little duration, you have even more volatility. If you have to take too much duration on the asset side of the portfolio, you've got more AOCI risk. And so our tools to stabilize work up to a point and then have some negative implications.So I don't really see a way to turn what we'd like to have. I don't see a way to turn this into just a flywheel of metronome that moves at a certain pace, and it's just a feature of what we do. And part of it is our institutional deposits have somewhat more asset sensitivity or liability sensitivity to rates relative to a very simple regional bank. So we'll tend to have a little more, but that's part of the industry. That's -- I think we're in line with peers."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Very good. Ron, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the success and the momentum you're having with the Alpha product in the Servicing business. In the Investment Services business, I should say. Is there any capacity constraints that you've got to be careful about if the momentum continues? Or is it almost now when you got plenty of bandwidth to handle future growth?"", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""Yes. I would say that the capacity constraint has been particularly with these large complicated client, the really large ones, some of which are -- well, most of which are still being onboarded, the capacity strength has been around onboarding. Over past year in particular, we've gotten better at that. You can -- if you just look at that number, we were roughly at about, as I recall, $3.6 trillion in assets to be onboarded, and we're now down to $2.3 trillion. So you can see we're getting better at that. The real constraint to be specific about it tends to be and how quickly do you onboard the middle office element to that because that often requires engineering and by that I mean, engineering with the client because ultimately, that's a client and it's like any other kind of industrial outsourcing.A client has an operation, does things in a particular way, wants to outsource that element of it to us, we're not interested in taking somebody's mess for less. I mean, we need to actually work with them to engineer it in a way where as much of it as possible is standardized and that the customization is limited to the kinds of user interfaces or how things are actually applied. And we've just gotten better at that over time. So I would say, looking forward, we don't see that as being a meaningful constraint."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.', 'James Francis Mitchell', ""Just maybe a follow-up on the outside of sort of the private markets, you've had -- you've ramped up pretty quickly in terms of getting to your $400 million of net of new servicing fee wins. And maybe if private markets are a quarter, can we talk a little bit about the other 3 quarters, where you've seen success? What's worked? What hasn't worked? And what kind of opportunity set do you see maybe even get above the $100 million?"", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""Jim, it's Ron. I mean, it's no one thing, but a lot of really important things across the board to ramp up our execution. Where we're seeing it to answer the first part of your question is the core Investment Managers segment still remains strong and active for us. And as some of those firms are facing the same kind of market that everybody else is, they're more interested than actually trying to do more with us and do different things with us.A little bit of a resurgence in the asset owner marketplace and in particular, amongst asset owners that aren't just pure asset allocators, meaning they're managing some assets themselves or truly actively asset allocating, doing not just listening to a consultant telling them what to do, but either managing money or at a strategic and tactical level, allocating assets, which again requires support.But in all cases, what we're doing is we're really focused on ensuring that the back office part of all this comes with -- and comes with it in a timely fashion, right? Because as I was saying earlier when I was talking to Gerard, the thing that takes a long time or a longer time to onboard would be the middle office, the outsourcing element of it. Onboarding back office is pretty easy, pretty straightforward. And it, in almost all instances, comes on in a pretty healthy incremental margin given the scale activities to it.And then finally, just to just talk about regions. We have invested heavily in the capabilities in all of our regions where you see the -- probably the most impact from that over the last couple of years, has been just the very good growth that we're seeing in Asia Pacific. And really, all parts of Asia Pacific from Australia north to Japan and everything in between.The U.S., we've talked about in the past, we were not pleased with where we were in this past year, particularly the second half of the year. We're actually reasonably pleased with how we've done. Europe has always been strong to us. It was a little softer in 2023, but again, a very strong pipeline. So -- but that regional focus where we're actually pushing accountability down into the country and regional level and making sure that it's very clear who is responsible for what, sharing, obviously, not just the technology and the product, but the best practices in how you move these things forward, but very much decentralizing the accountability."", 'James Francis Mitchell', ""Okay. That's all really helpful. And maybe, Eric, just a quick one on the held the maturity book still yielding just a little over 2%. Can you kind of walk us through the maturity profile of that? How long we start to see some pickup in -- or turnover and reinvestment benefits from that portfolio?"", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Yes, it's Eric. The way I describe it is we've got a natural roll-off in that portfolio. It's about $5 billion a year. So it sort of plays out and that's related to the maturity in the latter, so that will come down over the next couple of years. As that happens, because as you say, it's at a lower coupon relative to our average, right? Our average portfolio yields are in the [3.5%] range. There's real pickup that comes through that line, at least for the next couple of quarters, I guess, is probably for the next couple of years even, because once rates stabilize, we do think that we'll also get some steepness in the yield curve, and that will help through.So there are some benefits coming that way. It's also a portfolio that obviously will be insulate us from rate moves. I don't think in the next few years, this is the last down cycle versus up cycle, then that we'll see. And so it will serve its purpose then as well."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.', 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""So Eric, I wanted to start off with a question just on the fee guidance. And benchmarking your historical fee performance versus the guidance. You've struggled to at least meet or exceed the guide in the absence of significant equity market gains. Sorry, can you guys hear me okay?"", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', 'Yes.', 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""And I'm sorry about that. So you have a conservative market assumption embedded in the fee guide for the coming year. And just given that historical experience, I was hoping you could just provide additional granularity in terms of growth across the different fee lines that's underpinning that 3% to 4% growth assumption for this year."", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Sure. Let me maybe describe it in a couple of ways because 3% to 4% is for the overall franchise. We think that there are some areas of the franchise that will be higher and in some cases, a good bit higher than that. Asset Management, very geared towards the equity markets and the 10% tailwind in equity markets, comes through on literally half of that tends to right through the asset management fee line. And then the flows that we talked about earlier in the call provide a nice tailwind.So we need to see how markets play through, but the combination of those two, which is exactly how the business is designed, it's market-based and it's flow based, will be healthy. I think software and data processing, we've historically said high single digits, sometimes low double digits. If you look at the last couple of years, you're at the 9%, 10% average full year growth. We've got good visibility there. Part of that is Alpha and part of that is outright software and data sales. And so that's strong.I think at the other bookend, servicing fees will come in. It will be a bit below the 3% to 4%, now some of that is core organic net new business that we need to drive, which is why we've reshaped and tuned that area, in particular on the sales and how we go to market. You're seeing some of the benefits there and how we measure ourselves. We're being very conscious there. But one of the reasons that one will be lower this coming year is that we had that previously announced transition coming through, which will mute some of what we'd like to see.And then the markets activities, we're hoping will be somewhere in the middle of the range, whether FX trading and [sec] finance. I think what plays out behind the market dependent areas and sometimes why we don't need is around client -- what we describe as client activity, how much transactional activity, whether our clients are on the sidelines or whether they're all in, that this past year on the servicing fees which are half of our fees, that was worth 2 to 3 percentage points of servicing fee headwind. I mean that literally. So you do the math, that's worth $100 million, $150 million of headwind because we don't have those -- that activity, the transactional activity in derivatives, in international custody, which is very, very valuable to us.So part of what plays through is these macroeconomic features, equity bond markets on one hand, you've got client, the kind of risk-on risk-off sentiment, I think, is important. You've got volatility levels in FX and agency lending. And so those we have to live through and navigate through. And sometimes those will come in more strongly and sometimes less. And then I think finally, the piece that we do need to deliver on, Steve, is the part that we can control, which is sales, it's retention. And we've been very clear about our goals and our targets very purposely because that's where we think we need to hold ourselves particularly accountable and where you can hold us accountable. And there's a version of goals and targets in servicing. We spent a little extra time there. But if you go through our line of businesses, we've got similar kinds of goals area by area, and that's on us to deliver, which will help power us through. But the cyclical elements will still come and go."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""Eric. That's really helpful color. Just one quick follow-up for me. What's the assumed timing for the large client transition. Just wanted to get a sense as to whether that's reflected in the 1Q servicing fee guide or you're expecting that later in the year?"", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Let me see how -- let me try to describe this to you in a couple of ways and to be helpful. At this point, on a quarterly run rate basis, and I say that very specifically, we're about halfway through the transition, including a piece that came out in the fourth quarter. So we're halfway through on a quarterly run rate basis. We also, though, have to think about it on a fiscal year-on-year basis. And the way I would describe it on a fiscal year-on-year basis, remember, we said this was worth about 2 percentage points of total fees.That's what we've disclosed in our Qs and Ks. About 1/4 of that fiscally has come out through the end of '23, about half of it will come out through '24 and about another quarter in '25. So it just takes time to play through. And so we did include that headwind in the first quarter '24 versus first quarter '23 guide and it is important to that guide. And so our guide includes that, and you've got the net guide as a result."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.', 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', 'A very quick follow-up. I know the call has gone on so long. I heard you talk about just the right level of deposits between $200 billion and $210 billion, did you say that you expect the growth we saw in fourth quarter to reverse in 1Q as we think about the deposits shake out?', 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Ebrahim, it's Eric. No. What I said is that we think we'll operate in the $200 billion to $210 billion range in the first quarter, second, through the year. We expect that to be where we land. I think in fourth quarter on average, right, remember, we also, I think, talked a little bit about the months, we talked there's in-the-period data, which is very volatile. But on average, we ended up at, I think, around $207 billion for the quarter in 4Q.And so we think roughly flattish deposits into 1Q. It's just hard to tell. There's seasonality at year-end. There is -- there tends to be a low point in February, and then you've got cash building for tax purposes into March. But I'd call it flattish in the scheme of things but with a range of -- with a range around that."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', 'And just a bigger picture question around NIB mix and NII, do we need to get to a point where QT is short, the Fed is done with cutting rates before we see NII stabilize and maybe the deposit mix shift stabilize as well? Like do we need to get to that point? Or can it happen sooner than that?', 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""It's a fair question. My instinct on this is NIB will begin to stabilize sometime in 2024 by -- we think sometime in the by the middle of the year or third quarter. You've kind of at that point, I'll call it, burn through the largest accounts, those are the ones that kind of on a -- since its peak are down 75% NIB. The smallest accounts are down by about 25% since the peak, and those were seeing stabilize more and more.So I think we'll see some stability in NIB because clients and funds and fund boards have made their decisions, especially the ones that have $1 million or $2 million in an account, some of them just don't want to deal with the tax reporting, and so you'll get to some stabilization. So we think that will kind of stabilize.I think the broader question on NII will then come with how -- what -- well, and at that point, I think deposit betas kind of tend to stabilize as well. So I think at that point, in the second half of next year, the real question is what is the direction of interest rates on the front end. So very important question, which is what's going to -- what's -- where is the long end going to go? And where is the long end going to go in the U.S. versus in the international markets. And that is particularly important to the banking sector because with some amount of steepness in the yield curve, and I -- it's hard to remember when we've had steepness, it's been a while, some amount of steepness in the yield curve is quite accretive to NII, and you expect in a good economy to have some. And so that will be a feature.So there's a series of elements that will come through, and it's hard to I think, to, as a result, predict too precisely."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Ryan Kenny Morgan Stanley.', 'Ryan Michael Kenny', 'Just a follow-up on the capital side. So you had an 11.6% CET1 ratio. That was a nice improvement sequentially. It looks like that was driven mostly by $6 billion of lower RWA. Can you just help us impact the RWA dynamics a bit? What drove the optimization? And then you also mentioned RWA could be higher this year to support various businesses. Does that mean that the optimization was just temporary?', 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Sure. It's Eric. Let me describe it in a couple of different ways. We're all -- every bank tries to manage RWA just because it's part of our capital requirements and returns. And we try to report it carefully and we take -- we do it fully to the rules, as you'd expect. What tends to create the volatility because it's a spot measure, it's a one day of the quarter, 1 out of 90-day measure is the market factors. Right? So if you've got an FX or in any of the trading businesses, if you've got a forward book or even a vanilla derivative book, you've got counterparty exposures. You've got that are affected in particular by the currency pairs. And as those move around in the last week of the quarter, you might be in the money or out of the money in those positions and those directly because of how to standardize RWA mathematics work, just goes right through RWA. So that could create a swing of $4 billion, $5 billion on the size of our RWAs. Our RWAs is about 100 -- we printed around $112 billion. About half of that is in the markets area. And so there's a good bit of variability, and that's literally what happens. And so sometimes it will end up low, sometimes it will end up high. If you look at Page 4 -- Page 14 of the presentation materials, you'll see low point of $107 billion a year ago in RWA, you'll see a higher point of $118 billion last quarter and quite a bit of that is driven by just those market factors playing through into the calculations that we have. And then in addition to that, if you're on a loan book like we do, you'll have overdrafts. Overdrafts, take RWA as well. And so we also saw some amount of benefit there this quarter.I think the way I would describe the go-forward view is that we ended up particularly low this quarter. We said by it could be $6 billion, $7 billion lower than expected. What would par be, maybe I'll describe it that way, going forward, it might be $118 billion. It might be $120 billion. But you've got to put a plus $5 billion, minus $5 billion band around that. And so we'll -- what we want to do is we want to take -- we want to gently continue to reinvest capital into our businesses because these FX businesses now that we have, have good returns. We've managed them well. They've got 10%, 12% returns in many cases. The securities finance businesses typically are high single-digit return businesses, but that's healthy, and it's very connected to the servicing and the administrative fee business that we have and important to our clients.And so our view is that these are ways for us to solidify and expand and deepen our relationship with clients. And so we'll gently add RWA each year. How much do we add? We add a few billion dollars, $3 billion to $5 billion of more RWA each year perhaps. But there'll be some volatility around that. And that will be a part of the way we drive our organic growth. We're a high return bank, that's for sure. But we will -- we do want to put some of our capital to work for core organic growth reasons."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW.', 'Michael C. Brown', ""I guess I noticed that you saw record cash net inflows in 2023. And you mentioned that you actually took share in the institutional money market space. As we head into a declining rate environment here, I guess what's your expectation about how these cash and money fund assets could trend from here? I guess historically institutional money markets, they can act quite differently than retail. So I guess, once the Fed begins to reduce rates here, what are you thinking about in terms of the path of the flows out of money funds could you actually still see some money fund inflows from institutional investors?"", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""Yes. Mike, it's a good question and one we think about all the time. So part of way we've attracted more money market funds going back to one of my prior answers is we just have a broader client base. So -- and that helps. We've gained market share, not just in terms of assets, but we've just attracted more clients. And once you have them, whether the balances go up or down, you typically have them. I think historically, what's happened in terms -- and you've got to look back in history now because we haven't had this kind of a marketplace. But the really sophisticated holders of institutional money market funds tend to hang on, Right? Because the fund itself, depending on its duration, and there is a little bit of duration in it, actually lags -- so it's usually the opposite when rates are rising, the very sophisticated holders are toggling in and out depending on whether they see opportunities to go direct. Just given the nature of our client base, we don't see a lot of that activity. So we expect to keep them, and it really will be around where do their balances go and they needed for some -- or do they see more attractive investment opportunities. I would expect that we would see if indeed we see a continued risk on environment that itself will cause a little bit of reallocation (inaudible) institutional money market funds because saying that everybody what everybody is talking about that there's so much parked on the sidelines, well, a lot of it is parked here.But I would go back to where I began the answer, which is it really is about establishing more client relationships, servicing them very well and then continue to grow the number of clients based on that track record."", 'Michael C. Brown', ""Okay. Great. The $5 billion share buyback authorization that certainly was a big number. Eric, as you just alluded to in the last question, there's a lot of puts and takes to consider on the capital front in 2024 and into 2025. I guess my question is really just why come with such a large authorization? You're targeting 100% payout ratio. So this would seem to me that you certainly would not need all of that in 2024. It is this just a desire to have kind of a big authorization in place for a multiyear horizon or just to have more flexibility over time. Just love to hear a little bit more about that."", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Mike, it's Eric. The background here is that the industry has evolved, I would say, pre CCAR, which is a long time ago, there used to be open-ended authorizations in the banking sector. Once we got into CCAR, remember, there was a very defined annual amount of buybacks that you had to submit. In fact, you had to submit the first year and the second year, and there was a lot of making sure that what you submitted within the Fed CCAR process was actually what you did because I wanted to keep consistency with that. And so the industry moved towards quite a bit of disclosure on a 1-year basis as a result.And if you recall, a lot of those 1-year disclosures happened right after CCAR was announced at the either at the end of June or in the second quarter earnings in July. What we've seen as we've scanned at least the banking, our peer banks, the G-SIB, the large U.S. regionals is now that CCAR is -- it's still an annual process, but it's really with the SCB and some of the refinements to it, it's really an ongoing process. And what we've realized is that I'd say more than 3/4 of our peers, you probably know, have actually moved to open-ended programs. Over the last 1 year, 1.5 years. And so we just wanted to conform to that. As a result, this one is multiyear, it's open-ended and we'll take it from there."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""Well, no good deed goes unpunished $5 billion buyback to that last question. But are you assuming that Basel III gets modified and if Basel III didn't exist, how much higher would that $5 billion number be? And at what price do you say buybacks don't make so much sense anymore?"", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""Mike, maybe I'll start on the Basel III. I think it's -- where Basel III comes out is very uncertain at this point. The comment period ended January 16. I don't know how many millions of pages were submitted, but there's a lot to be evaluated there. And you all know the various pressure and response that the regulators are getting on this. So it's very hard to tell. I don't know that we would have changed the authorization if we had perfect clarity on where it was coming out, it was a factor, but it's not like we have a -- we think it's absolutely going to be this and therefore. So I hope that helps.Go ahead, Mike."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""No, just so where your base case, what is the RWA inflation, the most recent updates. We've gotten a few changes here during earnings season due to Basel III?"", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Yes, Mike, let me describe it this way. The headline that we've previously disclosed for the ANPR as it's written is Basel RWA increase for us at about 15%. So that's what we've shared. I think what we said at the time, and we actually believe even more so now is that it will come in at a portion of that. There's been lots of discussion around, for example, energy tax credits, some of the arcane parts of Basel and how that impacts public policy mortgages, which were not really affected on. There's much more discussion about operational risk literally over the last few months, and that would make us quite optimistic that the increases would be relatively small.So we've not updated it because it's just -- you got to -- there's a menu out there, but we're encouraged. We think the regulators are trying to navigate public policy and on one hand and the right level of capital in the banking system but we think that the direction of the discussions, in particular, over the last few months are constructive."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.', 'Brian Bertram Bedell', 'Most of the questions have been asked and answered. Can you hear me?', 'Eric Walter Aboaf', 'Yes.', 'Brian Bertram Bedell', ""Okay. Great. Most of questions have been answered. Just one quick one on securities portfolio repositioning. I guess, Eric, what's the desire to potentially do more of those and potentially take losses and look at the sort of the capital usage for doing that and enhancing NII and NIM more versus share buybacks?"", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Brian, it's Eric. It's something that we continue to think about. I think every bank continues to think about, we included. We're just continuing to just work through how do we feel about the rate levels that we're at, in particular on the up on the curve. We are conscious of that, both in the U.S. and in the international areas. We've got positions in pounds sterling and euros and so forth. So we'll just continue to evaluate it. I think as you indicated from your question, part of the reason we repositioned last year in the third quarter was around rate position. We thought it was a very good entry point. In retrospect, we timed that quite well. So we were quite pleased. And I think we felt like we came out ahead economically with the trade because we remember, we took out some bonds, but also reinvested both in the belly of the curve and overnight. So that was constructive.And we'll also keep an eye on. We don't have a lot of capital-intensive securities. We've always had a very vanilla book. So there's not an enormous capital motivation, but we'll selectively look at it. And see if it might make sense. But I think we're like many others. It's one of the things we keep an eye on."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.', 'Robert Henry Wildhack', ""I wanted to ask about the fee operating leverage target for this year. Hypothetically, let's say, fees come in better than you expect, would you anticipate dropping that down to the bottom line or reinvesting it? And maybe the same question in reverse, fees come in lower than expected. What kind of room is there on the expense side to preserve your fee operating leverage target?"", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""Yes, Rob, why don't I start on that. We feel like we've done a very good job this year in terms of -- I'm sorry, in 2023, focusing on BAU cost reduction to help finance and create a very sizable investment pool. Eric walked you through that. So Obviously, if fees are up dramatically more than expected, there are some revenue-related expenses, but I wouldn't foresee I think we've got a lot to invest and execute against and I really won't want to get through that. On the margin, there might be a few things that we would do, but the vast majority of it will go to the bottom line.On the -- in the case of the -- if the opposite occurs, whatever, a terrible market, geopolitical issues flare and you've just got a very different environment than any one of us anticipate. Again, we'd probably -- you'd see some revenue-related expenses come down naturally, which would help. I think at least my initial instinct would be to try and preserve the investments and look at is there any more to do on BAU, but then obviously, some of these -- we would -- we've got a pecking order for our investments in terms of priorities. And if it came to that, we defer them."", 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""And Rob, it's Eric. I would just add that we've got a pretty industrial productivity plan for this year. Part of that was the repositioning that we announced. But 2/3 of the roles impacted are really around delayering and simplifying State Street. We're actually taking our spans of control in some areas like operations from 5:1 to 8:1. We're taking standard controls in the business and staff functions in some cases, from 3:1 to 5:1, right? So -- and the benefit of that is it actually brings our teams -- our client teams and operational teams even closer to our clients, right? And some of what we're doing with the joint venture consolidation is a catalyst for that because, in some cases, we had too many handoffs and now we can simplify processes and again, bring them closer to our clients. So there's some real structural changes there. And what we do want to do is make sure we see those through. As Ron mentioned, there's always a little more, we'll look at on the margin. And it -- but we want to be careful. We want to do this right. But on the margin, you continue to work on vendors and so forth, if you look at performance-based incentive compensation, there are always other smaller levers. But we're pretty -- I think we've got a nice work set out and a lot to do. And I think we've got real confidence that this is, I think, year probably 5. I don't think we name our programs with annual versions. But this is probably a year 5 of productivity program and should really deliver quite a bit."", 'Robert Henry Wildhack', ""And then on the regulatory front, there was some commentary last week from the FDIC around regulations for large index fund providers. I'm curious if you have any thoughts there on how that can potentially impact your business?"", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""From the FDIC. Yes, I didn't see this, Rob. Curious as to the FDIC's role in index funds. I wonder what Vanguard has to say about that. So I'm just not familiar with it, Rob."", 'Robert Henry Wildhack', 'Okay. I can send it over to you later.', 'Eric Walter Aboaf', ""Yes. Why don't we follow up off-line, Rob, just send it through to Ilene and the team."", 'Ronald Philip O’Hanley', ""Yes, it could be, Rob, that GA is already on this. I just haven't seen that."", 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time.

Brendan Lawlor, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&A.Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.With that, let me now turn it over to Steve.', 'Stephen D. Steinour', ""Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to announce our fourth quarter results, which Zach will detail later. These results are again supported by our colleagues across the bank who live our purpose everyday as we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve.Now on to Slide 4. There are 5 key messages we want to leave you with today. First, we are leveraging our position of strength and executing on our strategic growth initiatives. We are well positioned to benefit during times like these. We managed our capital levels to enable us to accelerate initiatives during 2023 and support continued growth. We added key specialty verticals in commercial banking and expanded into the Carolinas.Second, we outperformed on both deposits and loans throughout the year. Our colleagues are acquiring new customers and deepening our existing customer relationships. Importantly, we delivered this growth while effectively managing our deposit beta. Third, we expect to modestly expand net interest income as we manage the challenges of the interest rate cycle and are driving increased fee revenues.Fourth, we are rigorously managing credit across our portfolios, consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. Credit trends are normalizing as expected, and we continue to believe we will outperform the industry on credit through the cycle.Finally, we remain intently focused on our core strategies. Huntington remains resilient through the events of 2023, emerging as one of the strongest regional banks. We maintained our disciplined execution, and we expect to grow earnings over the course of 2024 and continuing into 2025 and beyond.I will move us on to Slide 5 to recap our performance in 2023. Huntington delivered solid results over the course of the year against a challenging backdrop. While the banking sector faced headwinds early in the year, Huntington emerged as a secular winner, gaining new customers, adding over $3 billion of deposit growth and further bolstering our capital. We also increased loans by $2.5 billion for the full year or 2%, while driving capital ratios higher. We expect the pace of loan growth to accelerate in 2024. We added to our revenue base, primarily as net interest income increased by 3.3% for the full year. We maintained our leadership in customer satisfaction and digital capabilities having again been awarded the #1 ranking by J.D. Power for both categories. We remain focused on executing our strategies, including growing consumer primary bank relationships by 3%.Additionally, we completed the realignment of business segments. We also delivered on efficiency initiatives, including Operation Accelerate, the voluntary retirement program, staffing efficiencies and business process offshoring and branch and other real estate consolidations. We were nimble and opportunistic, adding key talent this past year with the addition of 3 new specialty commercial banking verticals. We also expanded our commercial and regional bank into the Carolinas, adding experienced teams in these attractive and high-growth markets.Additionally, we further strengthened our balance sheet and drove capital ratios higher over the course of the year. We are getting ahead of proposed industry requirements. And finally, credit was managed exceptionally well with full year net charge-offs of 23 basis points.Moving to Slide 6. Looking ahead to 2024, we have a clear set of objectives. We will leverage our position of strength to increase growth of both deposits and loans. This outlook will result in accelerated revenue growth and is further bolstered by fee opportunities. This posture coupled with our dynamic balance sheet management and hedging programs is expected to benefit the revenue and profitability outlook for 2024 and further expand into 2025 and beyond. This aligns with the improving macro backdrop, the higher probability of continued GDP growth and the avoidance of a hard landing. While we deliver this accelerated growth, we will continue to maintain our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite.Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance."", 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.15 and adjusted EPS of $0.27. The quarter included $226 million of notable items, primarily related to the FDIC special assessment, which impacted EPS by $0.12 per common share. Additionally, the termination of the pay-fixed swaption hedging program impacted pretax income by $74 million or $0.04 per share.Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 8.4% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 15.1%. Average deposits continued their trend of growth into the fourth quarter, increasing by $1.5 billion or 1%. Cumulative deposit beta totaled 41% through year-end. Loan balances increased by $445 million as we continue to optimize the pace of loan growth to drive the highest return on capital. Credit quality remains strong. The trend is normalizing consistent with our expectations, and net charge-offs totaled 31 basis points. Allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at 1.97%.Turning to Slide 8. As I noted, average loan balances increased quarter-over-quarter and were higher by 2% year-over-year. We expect the pace of future loan growth to accelerate over the course of 2024. Total commercial loans increased by $125 million for the quarter and included distribution finance, which increased by $225 million, benefited by normal seasonality as manufacturer shipments increased due to inventory build of winter products. Auto Floorplan increased by $359 million and CRE balances, which declined by $361 million, including the impact of payoffs and normal amortization, and all other commercial categories net decreased as we continue to drive optimization towards the highest returns.In Consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage, which increased by $295 million and RV/Marine, which increased by $121 million, while auto loan balances declined for the quarter.Turning to Slide 9, as noted, we continued to gather deposits consistently in the fourth quarter. Average deposits increased by $1.5 billion or 1% from the prior quarter.Turning to Slide 10. Growth was maintained each month throughout the fourth quarter, continuing the recent trend. Total cumulative deposit beta ended the year at 41%, in line with our expectations and reflecting the decelerating rate of change we would expect at this point in the rate cycle. As we've noted in the past, where beta ultimately tops out will be a function of the end game for the rate cycle in terms of the level and timing of the peak and the duration of any extended pause before a decrease.Given market expectations for rate cuts to start sometime in 2024, our current outlook for deposit beta remains unchanged, trending a few percentage points higher and then beginning to revert and fall, if and when we see rate cuts from the Fed. When interest rate cuts commence, we expect to manage betas on the way down with the same discipline as we have during the increasing rate cycle.Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest-bearing mix shift continues to track closely to our forecast with deceleration of sequential changes. The noninterest-bearing percentage decreased by 80 basis points from the third quarter and we continue to expect this mix shift to moderate and stabilize during 2024.On to Slide 12. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $52 million or 3.8% to $1.327 billion. Net interest margin declined sequentially to 3.07% in line with our forecast. Cumulatively over the cycle, we have benefited from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins with net interest revenues growing at an 8% CAGR over the past 2 years.Reconciling the change in NIM from Q3, we saw a decrease of 13 basis points. This was primarily due to lower spread net of free funds, which accounted for 9 basis points, along with a 2-basis-point negative impact from lower FHLB stock dividends and a 2-basis-point reduction from hedging.Turning to Slide 13. Let me share a few added thoughts around the fixed rate loan repricing opportunity that will benefit us over the moderate term. The construct of our balance sheet is approximately half fully variable rate. 10% in indirect auto, which is a shorter approximately 2-year average life, and 10% in arms with a 4-year average life. The remainder of approximately 30% is longer average life fixed rate.We have seen notable increases in fixed asset portfolio yields thus far in the rate cycle. Even as the forward curve forecasts lower short-term rates, many of our fixed rate loan portfolios retain substantial upside repricing opportunity for some time to come. We forecast approximately $13 billion to $15 billion of fixed rate loan repricing opportunity in 2024 with an estimated yield benefit of approximately 350 basis points.Slide 14 provides the drivers of our spread revenue growth. As a reminder, we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios. The basis of our planning and guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that is bounded on the lower end by a scenario which includes 5 rate cuts in 2024. The higher scenario assumes rates stay higher for longer and tracks closely with the Fed's dot plot from year-end. This scenario assumes 3 cuts in 2024.We continue to be focused on managing net interest margin in a tight corridor. Should the lower rate scenario play out and we see rate cuts as early as March that will likely result in a margin over the course of the year within a range near the level we saw in the fourth quarter. This would equate to a net interest margin between 3% and 3.1% for each quarter of 2024. If the higher for longer scenario comes to pass, we expect the margin to expand and at a level that is up to 10 basis points above that.As we saw in December, the outlook for longer-term interest rates also moved lower significantly. There were a number of benefits from this lower market rate outlook. First, it resulted in higher capital levels, given AOCI accretion, which supports our accelerated loan growth outlook now.Second, it provides for easing deposit competition over time. Third, it provides credit support for borrowers with the potential for locking in lower long-term rates. However, the rate outlook is incrementally more challenging for full year spread revenue than the levels we had seen underlying our guidance in December. None of these items, including the forecasted pace of loan growth, we now expect net interest income on a dollar basis to trough in the first quarter before expanding sequentially from that level over the course of the year.Turning to Slide 15. Our contingent and available liquidity continues to be robust at $93 billion and has grown quarter-over-quarter. At quarter end, we continue to benefit from a diverse and highly granular deposit base with 70% insured deposits. Our pool of available liquidity represented 206% of total uninsured deposits appear leading coverage.Turning to Slide 16. Our level of cash and securities at year-end increased as we've begun to reinvest portfolio cash flows during the fourth quarter. This investment strategy is consistent with our approach to continue to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio lower over time. We have reduced overall hedge duration of the portfolio from 4.1 years to 3.7 years over the past 18 months.Turning to Slide 17. We we've updated our forecast for the recapture of AOCI. As of year-end, we've recaptured 26% of total AOCI from the peak level at September 30. Using market rates at year-end we would recapture an estimated incremental 44% of AOCI over the next 3 years.Turning to Slide 18. We continue to be dynamic in positioning our hedging program. As the rate outlook changed over the course of the fourth quarter, we focused our objective incrementally on the protection of NIM in down rate scenarios and actively reduced instruments that were intended to protect capital in up-rate scenarios. As we announced in late December, we terminated the pay-fixed swaptions program as our assessment of the probability for substantial uprate moves decreased. Over the course of Q2 through Q4, this program worked as intended, providing significant protection against possible tail risk up-rate moves with a modest overall cost for that insurance.Additionally, during the quarter, we added to our down rate NIM protection strategies, adding $2.1 billion of forward starting received fixed swaps and adding $1 billion of floor spreads. We exited $2 billion of collars, which were near expiration. Our objective with respect to our downgrade hedging activities remains unchanged to support the management of net interest margin in a tighter range as possible.Moving on to Slide 19. Our fee growth strategies remain centered on 3 key areas: capital markets, payments and wealth management. Note this quarter in our earnings materials we've updated the presentation of our noninterest income categories in order to more clearly highlight our strategic areas of focus and more closely align to the way we manage the business.Slide 35 in the appendix provides further detail on the components of each line item. These 3 key focus areas for fee growth collectively represents 63% of total noninterest income. We're seeing positive underlying growth in each of these areas. In Capital Markets, we're pleased that revenues expanded sequentially. Both advisory and core bank capital market products grew in the quarter. Our outlook is constructive for 2024, and we expect capital markets to remain a key driver for fee revenue growth over the medium term.Payments and cash management revenue includes debit and credit card revenues, along with treasury management and merchant processing. Our payments opportunity is substantial, reflecting 31% of total fee revenues today, with the potential for significant growth over time. Wealth and asset management revenue has benefited from the realignment earlier this year, which brought together our Private Bank and retail advisory businesses under one umbrella. Our advisory penetration rate of the customer base continues to increase as wealth advisory households have grown 11% year-over-year and assets under management are up 16% from a year ago.Moving on to Slide 20. On an overall level, GAAP noninterest income decreased $104 million to $405 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the mark-to-market on the pay fix swaptions and the CRT premium, fees increased by $5 million quarter-over-quarter.Moving on to Slide 21 on expenses. GAAP noninterest expense increased by $258 million and underlying core expenses increased by $47 million. As I mentioned, we incurred $226 million of notable item expenses related primarily to the FDIC deposit insurance fund special assessment during the quarter. It also included the last portion of costs related to our staffing efficiency program and corporate real estate consolidations. Excluding these items, core expense included higher personnel and professional services, driven by seasonally higher benefits expense incentives as well as consulting expenses.The level of expenses we saw in the fourth quarter is largely consistent with the dollar amount we expect quarterly over the course of 2024. This is inclusive of the investments we've discussed previously as well as sustained efficiencies we are driving across the company.Slide 22 recaps our capital position. Reported common equity Tier 1 increased to 10.3% and has increased sequentially for 5 quarters. Our adjusted CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI, was 8.6%. This metric increased 58 basis points compared to the prior quarter, driven by adjusted earnings net of dividends as well as the benefit from the credit risk transfer transaction we announced in December, which more than offset the impact from the FDIC special assessment.We also saw a significant benefit from AOCI recapture given the move in rates during the quarter. Our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher while maintaining our top priority to fund high-return loan growth. We intend to drive adjusted CET1 inclusive of AOCI into our operating range of 9% to 10%.On Slide 23, a credit quality continues to perform very well and with normalization of metrics consistent with our expectations. Net charge-offs were 31 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than Q3 by 7 basis points and resulted in full year net charge-offs of 23 basis points. This outcome was aligned with our outlook for full year net charge-offs between 20 and 30 basis points at the low end of our target through the cycle range for net charge-offs of 25 to 45 basis points.Gross charge-offs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with the overall change in net charge-offs, largely a result of lower recoveries. Given ongoing normalization, nonperforming assets increased from the previous quarter, while remaining below the prior 2021 level. The criticized asset ratio increased quarter-over-quarter, with risk rating changes within commercial real estate being the largest component. Allowance for credit losses was higher by 1-basis-point to 1.97% of total loans, and our ACL coverage ratio continues to be among the top quartile in the peer group.Let's turn to our outlook for 2024. As we mentioned, we expect to drive accelerated loan growth between 3% and 5% for the full year. Deposits are likewise expected to continue their solid trend of growth between 2% and 4%. As a result of the loan growth and margin outlook I shared earlier, net interest income for the full year is expected to range between down 2% to up 2%. The pace of loan growth, coupled with the rate scenario we see actually play out will drive the range of spread revenue. If the higher for longer rate scenario plays out and loan growth tracks to the top end of our range, we expect net interest income to grow by approximately 2%. If the lower scenario comes to fruition and loan growth tracks to the lower end of our growth range, we could see spread revenue declining 2 percentage points. In both scenarios, I expect net interest income to trough in the first quarter before expanding throughout 2024 from that level.Noninterest income on a core underlying basis is expected to increase between 5% and 7%. The baseline of core excludes notable items, the mark-to-market impact from the pay fix swaption program as well as CRT impacts. Fee revenue growth is expected to be driven primarily by capital markets, payments and wealth management. Core expenses are expected to increase by 4.5%. This level reflects the finalization of our budget and includes the additional loan growth we discussed earlier, which will have some incremental compensation expense tied to production. Expenses could fluctuate depending on the level of revenue-driven compensation, primarily associated with our fee-based revenues, including capital markets. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% for the full year. We expect net charge-offs for the full year to be between 25 and 35 basis points.With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move to questions and answers. Tim, over to you."", 'Timothy R. Sedabres', 'Thanks, Zach. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only 1 question and 1 related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.', 'Manan Gosalia', ""I wanted to start off on the expense guide change. I know it's a small change from 4% to 4.5%, but it is higher than some of your peers are guiding to -- for 2024. So just hoping you could elaborate more on what's going into that? And also if there is a similar flex on the expense side as there is on the revenues. So for instance, if you get to your down 2% NII number with more rate cuts. Does that drive a little bit of flex in the expense side as well?"", 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""Great question, Manan, this is Zach, I'll take that. We -- the guidance that we had given back in October and in December was really primarily designed to be an early view for you. So you can get an insight into some of the key decisions we're making. And for us, we're really be able to just discuss that in detail. That was the approximate 4% we discussed before. The finalization of our budget reflects the additional loan growth that we've now added to the plan and associated -- fee revenues as well is that what represents the difference up to 4.5%. To give you a sense, it's about $5 million a quarter, so relatively small. I think you are -- and the underlying drivers of that are unchanged from what we have discussed before.We'll continue to drive significant efficiencies in the core based on expenses with a number of programs. We'll continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We'll execute on the incremental build of capabilities and automation and data to get ahead of coming regulations and we'll execute on the new -- really attractive commercial growth opportunities we've discussed before. All of that's included in that number and no change to our expectation as well about reducing that growth rate as we go into 2024 -- 2025, excuse me, back to more normalized levels.As it relates to your question in terms of the kind of marginal sensitivity. Certainly, that will be just under (inaudible). I think the expense on guidance is generally calibrated to so the middle of the ranges we've got in growth in revenues. And so we -- some potential upside of expenses if all of the revenues hit the high end and likewise some potential opportunity if the revenues were below (inaudible)."", 'Manan Gosalia', ""Great. And my next question was on the deposit franchise. You have a pretty strong core consumer deposit franchise. And some of your peers have highlighted that there's still some lagged upward repricing in deposits there. So can you talk about how you expect those deposits to behave over the next few quarters and then as the Fed begins to cut rates?"", 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""This is Zach. I'll take that one again. What we've been seeing in the marketplace broadly with respect to deposit cost and deposit beta, both -- across both consumer and commercial is the -- as we're going to expect a deceleration of the sequential changes and very much for us trending highly aligned to our expectations. As well, I will tell you that we are beginning to see in the marketplace a fairly constructive initial signs of firms preparing for what will likely be soon a down-rate environment with a shortening, for example, of time deposit terms with a change of promotional terms on the money market and select testing of different price points for unique segments and unique geographies, all which is what you'd expect to presage will ultimately be a series of down beta moves.With respect to your specific question on consumer and sort of build that trend. I think the answer is yes. What we have been saying all along is that deposit costs and beta will continue to trend out of decelerating rate through the pause period until such time as there is a rate reduction. And so that's our expectation as well. I'll say, the go-to-market pricing is generally pretty consistent, if not testing somewhat lower price points, but there's, of course, sort of an embedded momentum of somewhat upward bias in terms of pricing for at least over the quarter here, and then we'll see. Do we get a rate cut in March, somewhat aggressive in our view as possible, which case down rate begins very quickly. The rate environment holds out with the pause until September, in which case we'll see kind of a longer period of drift."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.', 'Erika Najarian', ""And by the way, whoever wrote that script, the guidance could not be any clearer, so that was great. Just that being said, a few follow-up questions. The loan growth guidance from your peers would imply the macro outlook, which is pretty consensus is indicative of software opportunities and perhaps this is a good chance. Clearly, you've been telling us for the past few years that you've set yourself up differently and you've got yourself up differently to outperform. And maybe go back through those opportunities that I think that the average loan growth number is certainly notable versus peers and perhaps remind us of why Huntington is a particularly unique set of growth opportunity for this year."", 'Stephen D. Steinour', ""Erika, this is Steve. I'll start with that because you've asked a broader history. And then Zach can may comment. So first, we do think the discipline on our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite, which has been in place now for 14 years, has been a governor. And it has helped us as we've decided what business to pursue and what not to see. With that in mind, we've been very purposeful and strategic about growing these businesses. And you saw at the Investor Day, a mid-teens rate of growth like the specialty banking. So we have a very strong middle market core banking set of capabilities. We have a tremendous amount of small business capabilities and capacity. We have market density in Ohio on small business and we're achieving that now in other states. So the core sort of regional banking franchise performing very, very well.And you add to that the specialties that have been put in place, just 3 new ones last year, which by the way, they're all off to terrific starts. And then the expansion we've been in like Dallas and Charlotte for a decade or more, when we see opportunities, we may pursue them. An example of that is in the Carolinas, where we believe we've got a fanatic group of new colleagues coming to us with teams. These are some just outstanding people that we've been following for years and it all came together. We were investing, others were not, and there was some moment to be dynamic.In addition to that, we still have opportunities in the TCF markets. We're doing incredibly well in Michigan. But what I would say we're early stage still in Chicago, the Twin Cities and Denver. And we like those markets, each of those markets. So we believe with the investments we made in specialty banking, the core regional bank performing well with opportunity. We've got lots of growth of potential in the next few years. And that's with the -- I didn't talk about the asset finance business. Our distribution finance business is the horse they had a phenomenal year last year. Our auto business is one of our best businesses. We've got one of our really terrific teams in that area. Floorplan has done very, very well in terms of its growth as well.So lots of growth options, the equipment finance more broadly, so a lot of growth options in that, and we're seeing that through the cycle. And so we believe we're poised to outperform and have budgeted and expect our colleagues to do so in the coming years."", 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""This is Zach. I just want to talk on two things. First of all, thanks for the compliment in terms of the guidance and all the credit to our really terrific Investor Relations team. But just -- one thing I would add on top of that is we were pretty purposeful about staying on a growth splitting across the board. And importantly, in terms of the financial resources and investment that we're putting against our core growth opportunities. And recognize that the net outcome of that, including some of the other things that we want to do in terms of data and automation capabilities would result in an overall expense growth. It was higher than we would want to have relative to revenue growth, higher than we would typically target and it certainly was something we discussed at length, as you know.But we took that view purposely and recognized it was contrarian because in our view the long-term earnings potential of staying in that growth posture is so much more advantageous than worry to have really significantly ratcheted back investments and expenses. And so a bit of short-term challenge with respect to operating leverage will yield very significantly better earnings growth trajectory through the course of 2024 and 2025 earnings outlook looks exceptionally strong as well. So just to tack on to Steve's point, I think the whole system is really working and that was just particularly (inaudible)."", 'Erika Najarian', 'For sure. And you had the capital. So it all makes sense. And just a follow-up question. Again, so many moving pieces in terms of the rate outlook. But Zach, if maybe update us on your rate sensitivity as of 12/31 (inaudible) that you may -- in terms of your balance sheet management? And also, if you could give us a little bit more detail about what you mean in terms of managing the betas on the way down at a similar discipline. And I wonder if you could give us maybe your expectations on deposit beta for the first 100 basis points of rate cut.', 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""Sure. Great questions, both. There's a lot in there to unpack, so we address those both. As it relates to asset sensitivity for December, I expect it to be roughly consistent with the asset sensitivity we saw that was reported in the end of October, you see that come out in the Q -- I'm sorry, the K. As we've discussed over time, the business is naturally asset sensitive. And so clearly, on the way up with the interest rate cycle benefited very significantly in terms of margin expansion in revenue growth.I will note as well, something just important to assess as you're thinking about asset sensitivity is in our securities portfolio. As you know, we hedged a large portion of available-for-sale securities, which has benefited significantly in terms of yields rising higher protecting capital in the asset sensitivity metric in the [Dow 100 rapid] scenario, for example, it represents about a percentage point of additional sensitivity from those swaps. Those swaps will roll off over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. And most of that impact on sensitivity will begin to ramp off starting in the second half of 2014 and continuing on for about a 12-month period thereafter.The other thing I'll just say as an important point is those sensitivity metrics are pretty academic and not standardized across the industry. With lots of assumptions of the beta being the most significant, but also whether those analyses are ramped on top of the forward curve or whether they're just from a start point. Ours is a ramp on top of the forward curve. So certainly, if I just report to assess those assumptions pretty carefully in comparing those metrics across firms.Back to -- so in terms of our balance sheet management posture, incrementally from here, I see the opportunity to add downside rate reduction hedges. Our hedging strategy is incrementally shifting from a focus on capital production to a focus on down rate protection, as we discussed in the prepared remarks. And we added some of that in Q4, I suspect we'll continue to be incrementally adding into those down rate of protection strategies over time, which would gradually reduce downside asset sensitivity.In terms of deposit beta and what we would be expecting for the first X basis points, our -- to give you a sense, in the scenario that I'm looking at where rates in fact, begin to fall in March and then have 5 cuts in them, so it's a little more in your scenario, we would expect to see about a 20% roughly down beta over a 3-quarter period by the end of 2024, would of course, be less than that. If there was an extended pause through sort of the late summertime period. But just to give you a sense of the sensitivity to your question."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.', 'John G. Pancari', 'On the capital front, I know your CET1 increased nicely, about 15 basis points to 10% in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter. Just as you look at the trajectory here and your outlook for earnings and capital -- organic capital generation, how are you thinking about potentially ramping up buybacks and capital return overall.', 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""Great question, John. This is Zach. I'll take that one. We're very pleased with the outcomes around the overall action plan we've had with respect to managing capital and our capital priorities throughout the course of 2023 as we talked about actively modulating the pace of loan growth to balance additional loan growth in revenue with also accreting capital on the balance sheet clearly in the fourth quarter benefited significantly from a recapture of AOCI, which allows us now to even yet again, accelerate the pace of loan growth, as we discussed earlier.And for the foreseeable future, I see us continuing on with that posture driving the most important capital prior we have is to fund higher-term loan growth. And there is a significant opportunity for us to do that, which is the most value-creating decision that's in front of us. And importantly, at 8.6%, our adjusted CET1 is -- it has been rising a lot and want to drive that into the 9% to 10% operating range that we've discussed over time. So I think for the foreseeable future, we'll continue on with that plan. Once we get into the 9% to 10% range with adjusted CET1, we'll reassess our posture with respect to share repurchases.Over time, share repurchases are a really important point, a part of the value creation model for the company, and I actually expect us to get back to them. And we're going to drive through those outcomes as soon as we possibly can."", 'Stephen D. Steinour', ""And John, as Zach shared with you on the third quarter call, we are advancing as if the pending capital requirements are in place. So we're building capital now that will meet those requirements should they be adopted."", 'John G. Pancari', ""Great. All right. And then also for you, Steve, I guess related to that, maybe if you could just talk about the whole debate around the need for scale as you look longer term at the evolution that's going on right now within the regional banks post these last year's failures and so the regulatory requirements and the need for scale to compete. How do you view the potential for whole bank M&A as a role in Huntington's outlook? And what's the earliest do you think from an industry perspective, not necessarily for Huntington that you think we can actually see a pickup in whole bank M&A given the backdrop in regulators."", 'Stephen D. Steinour', ""Well, that's a series of questions, John. I'll try to answer them, but I may miss on one aspect. This is back up for a moment, you had 3 idiosyncratic banks failed. And you've seen the rest of the industry sort of adjust and adopt and respond very quickly. And the poor strength of the industry, I don't think is in question now. And for us, we believe in having a very focused, disciplined and a broadly diversified set of businesses, and we've been able to build those and achieve that the posture and it has served us very, very well as we've seen in the second half of last year and continuing to this year. So we're very bullish on our ability to organically grow and expect -- and that's our focus. And we'll continue to do that. You may see further announcements from us this year in terms of organic growth moves and I expect that we will continue to be maybe a bit contrarian, but agile, as we continue to advance. We think we have tremendous opportunities already in the business lines that we have.So in terms of scale, I think the regulatory response is in reaction to those 3 failures is raising questions about how much (inaudible) will the industry -- or banks will benefit from in the industry over time. The expectations have clearly increased as they should. And we are investing in our risk management platform. I think I shared on the third quarter call, for example, we will have much better intraday visibility on deposit flows in the near term as a consequence. There are a series of things like this that we're addressing.Now I don't know the -- we've been investing in risk management since I arrived in 2009, so I don't know how we compare -- really compared to other banks. I think we've always viewed the stress test results where we've been top quartile or even leading in terms of the portfolio stretches by the regulators as a barometer. And it looks like that was a very good measure, at least at this point. So we're not anticipating a change in posture at this stage. We don't feel compelled that we have to do something. And yet at the same time, should there be opportunities somewhere in the future, we take a look, but it has to be in a risk-adjusted context that makes sense to us. And I don't see that activity in '24. I think we've got a tremendous amount of core growth to deliver, and we're excited about that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.', 'Steven A. Alexopoulos', 'I want to start -- for you Zach, big picture. So historically, a steep yield curve has been a positive catalyst for bank margins and earning. But given how you position the balance sheet, right, with the use of hedges, have you in a sense traded away much of that potential benefit or to have a more stable NIM today?', 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""Great question, Steve. I think the short answer to your question is, no. The steeper yield curve continues to better than us. Obviously, that's -- with that environment would be indicative of funding costs, which are -- which would represent solid margins against where asset yields are.I think more of this really strange environment with inverted yield curves with a dramatic kind of reduction forecasted pretty quick here. So we'll see how it all plays out. But I think for us, the puts and takes with respect to NIM outlook in the moderate term through 2024. One, we're going to continue to benefit very significantly from fixed asset repricing. We try to provide some incremental clarity about that in the prepared remarks in the presentation. So good to see 50- to 100-basis-point moves in overall portfolio yield in the [TFX] categories, we'll continue to see that benefit us out not only for '24, but into '25 and beyond.Another thing is for us, as the curve becomes less inverted, we'll see our negative carry from our downgrade hedge protection program reduced the negative carry impact, by the way, in Q4 it was around 17 basis points of drag. We've talked about likely we'll see about 10 bps of that come back to us if you believe the scenario kind of pretty align the forward curve here over the next of 4 quarters. Funding costs, again, in a steeper yield curve environment where short rates have fallen will really start to benefit us in terms of beginning to pivot toward down beta. We're actually executing on down beta to Erika's question earlier. And those things in total, essentially offset for us in our NIM, the variable yield reduction that we'll see if and when the short end comes down.So I don't believe that, that Goldilocks scenario of a nice upward sloping yield curve is accretive to margins and be supportive of it. And the goal we've got is the same, to try to really color the NIM here, put a floor under it and really position for upside. And I think the last thing I'd say is kind of getting to your question as well. The modeling that we have done about 2025, so it's been taking a while, it really highlights NIM expansion opportunities, which again is sort of an indication that the upward sloping yield curve is positive."", 'Steven A. Alexopoulos', ""Okay. That's helpful. Zach, I asked the question because earlier you said if the rates stay higher for longer, your NIM would be about 10 basis points higher in 2024 versus the Fed cutting. But as we move beyond 2025, 2026, there's a clear benefit to the NIM. Are you able to quantify for us like on a longer-term basis, assuming the forward curve played out, we've given the -- what's on and what's rolling off, where the NIM could be long term for Huntington?"", 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""Sure. Yes. The point on the higher NIM and the scenario is that higher (inaudible), it's not only a scenario where short-end stays out for longer but also longer-end stays out for longer. And I will note that sort of much of our balance sheet yields that kick off the belly of the curve, 2- to 5-year range. And so we think that's a good point to consider. Look over the longer term, I see north of 3 into the low 3s in terms of NIMs at a sustainable level. Of course, the business mix continues to shift. So I think it's hard to really be precise about that. And we already -- several years out, we'll have to continue to do our modeling. But over the foreseeable future, we see that range of sort of 300 to 310 in the quicker rate reduction scenario, maybe as much as 10 bps higher than that. If rates they are longer through '24. And then I would see another step-up into '25 assuming the yield curve holds generally than sort of (inaudible)."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of John Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Jon Glenn Arfstrom', 'A couple of guidance clarifications for you, Zach. When you say 1Q net interest income is a trough, how deep is that trough? How much lower, where do you want us to start, I guess, for 1Q.', 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""Good question. Q1, by the way, is typically seasonally lower just with day count and just other mix items. And so I think we'll probably see a level that is lower than Q4 by around the same amount that Q4 was lower than Q3 and then begin to grow from there. And so it's really the kind of trajectory from there that's really the major difference in the guidance range, given that if you just pull back low growth, I would expect in Q1 will be about the same year-on-year as we saw in Q4, i.e. around 2%. And then steadily accelerating from there and ending the year growing average and potentially above the high end of the loan growth range. The average should be the 3% to 5%, I discussed, there's a trajectory for sure during the year. And likewise, in terms of NIM, I think it's likely that the NIM will likely be at its lowest spot in the year -- in the first quarter and then kind of rising pretty heavily dependent on which scenario you look at, but that's the general trajectory I'm expecting."", 'Jon Glenn Arfstrom', ""Okay. Okay. Good. I think it's important to set that up. And then on expenses, when you say consistent, there's a lot of hand-wringing last quarter on your expense guide. And when you say consistent, are you basically saying flat line expenses quarterly for 2024, meaning that all the expense investments and in things that you've done are essentially in the run rate today and you don't see a lot of these pressures as '24 progresses? Is that fair?"", 'Zachary J. Wasserman', ""It's an excellent one, I really pursue the chance to clarify that. Broadly speaking, the answer is yes. The dollar amount of expenses overall, we saw on a core basis in Q4, the forecast we've got in our budget represents pretty similar dollar amounts overall for each of the quarters during 2024 coincidently. There's -- in my mind, I try to illustrate this picture for you, there's a variety of factors that are kind of offsetting each other and driving within that. I would say there's still a little bit of additional ramp-up of run rate, some of the incremental capability investments that we're doing. Likewise, a little bit of additional ramp-up in some of these new initiatives like in the commercial business. We're also actively tuning our overall strategic investments to modestly offset that.And then lastly, you've got these efficiency programs, which are accumulating in their impact over time. The business process reengineering initiative we've been driving for quite some time, we internally call it operation accelerates. The business process offshoring initiative, which, by the way, is also growing, accumulating. So there's sort of a series of factors that are netting together, but the result of it is basically dollars that are pretty consistent with a pretty tight range from Q4."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Our next question will be from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Nate Stein on behalf of Matt. I just wanted to ask about commercial credit. Commercial real estate net charge-offs increased versus 3Q levels. Can you talk about what drove that and just touch on the outlook for commercial real estate credit quality this year? And then on the C&I side, these also continue to normalize. Can you talk about what you're seeing in this book?"", 'Brendan Lawlor', ""Sure, Nate, this is Brendan. I'll take that. For the quarter, yes, we did see on a basis point perspective, it was an increase in the commercial real estate side. But I want to sort of point you to the dollars, there is $20 million of charge-offs in the quarter, and it really represented 3 transactions. So it's consistent with our view of the real estate portfolio at this time, which is from a charge-off perspective, the focus will be in the office portfolio. That's where we think that there is potential for loss content, which is why we've increased our reserves to approximately 10% there. And so what you're seeing in the current quarter is sort of the manifestation of that message that we've been delivering for some time.Let me take a step back and look more broadly, the portfolio on commercial in general is actually performing pretty well. I mean, the C&I side of the house has had its individual idiosyncratic issues. But in general, the strength of the portfolio is the result of our strong portfolio management and our low-to-moderate risk profile that we talked. So I feel really good about the commercial portfolio at this time."", 'Stephen D. Steinour', ""So Nate, it's Steve. The charge-offs, gross charge-offs, Q3 and Q4 were $2 million a part. That it was very, very similar. The difference was in all other recoveries. The pre portfolio is performing very well. The office portfolio has -- had minimal losses, 23 bps for the year. (inaudible) charge-offs is outstanding. We're very pleased with how the performance has occurred, and we're confident going forward. Thanks for the question."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'All right. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the criticized assets. So these also kick up in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about what drove that?', 'Brendan Lawlor', ""This is Brendan again, Nate. As Zach said in the prepared remarks, it really came out of our commercial real estate portfolio. The impact of higher short-term rates has persisted, and that's what's reflected in those results. Again, we have been signaling through the second half of last year that we expected criticized to move up. And that's exactly how it played out. Again, we have good confidence in our client selection in that portfolio and solid reserve against it overall. So I guess, I classify that as just more credit normalization across the portfolio. Thank you for the question."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.', 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""Just wanted to follow up on the loan growth guide, Steve. It does feel at the higher end of what we've seen over the last week from your peers. Not -- sorry if I missed it, but give us a sense of how much of this is -- this market share gain that you expect versus the underlying growth that you're seeing in these markets and your expectations, I guess, tied to GDP growth?"", 'Stephen D. Steinour', ""Well, we've had growth last year of 2%. If anything, I think the signal from the Fed pivot will foster further loan growth for the industry. And we are in an advantaged position. And so we'll capture share from that, but we also have the specialty banking initiatives in the Carolinas and they began with no portfolio. So there's no prepayment -- repayment of risk, obviously, and that's all net loan growth. But those groups are off to terrific stocks.We're very, very pleased with the quality of colleagues that we've been able to attract to the Huntington. And I'm quite confident in our teams, both the core teams that Bill deliver in our footprint, especially banking teams. And frankly, our consumer lending teams are outstanding as well. So as we come into the year, we've got momentum, and we're going to continue to invest in these businesses and that cumulatively should help us achieve or even exceed the goals."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""Got it. And I guess what I didn't here see was any mention of fiscal stimulus, the chipset, et cetera, flowing through your market. Is that not as meaningful going forward around moving the needle on growth?"", 'Stephen D. Steinour', ""The markets have -- broadly speaking, we're talking about 11, 12 states that we're in with our network. But here in Columbus, which is what you're referring with the Intel plant, that plant is well under construction and the supply chain commitments will largely be made, we think, this year as they move towards opening in the following year. So we have some unusual factors that are strengthening the outlook here in Greater Columbus, and we have very, very significant market share here and lead by a lot in most categories. But it'll also -- the broader region and that's one of just many sectors that have chosen the Midwest. I think batteries front from East Michigan, Ann Arbor through Columbus and some of the announcements last year, including the Honda joint venture here in Greater Columbus on the battery front. There's a lot of investment that's being made in the core footprint, all of which will generate economic benefit for the industry. So for the industry and certainly for us, with our leadership position in any of these areas. Thanks for the question.So I think we're hitting the top of the hour. I'm just going to wrap. I want to thank you very much for joining us today. In closing, we're pleased with the fourth quarter results as we dynamically managed to this environment. We believe we're well positioned investments we made in '23 will further drive revenue growth in '24 and beyond. Our focus is on driving core revenue growth, carefully managing expenses to support investments in the business and growing loan in consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. The management team is focused on executing our strategies that we previously shared.And as a reminder, the Board of executives or colleagues were top 10 shareholders and that creates strong long-term alignment with our shareholders generally. And finally, we're grateful to our nearly 20,000 exceptional colleagues to deliver these outstanding results and our perennial award winners for customer service. Thank you all very much. I appreciate your interest in Huntington. Have a great day."", 'Operator', ""This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

Realty Income owns over 13,200 properties."", 'It is, in fact, the largest player in the net-lease space. To put a number on that, its market cap is roughly $42 billion, making Realty Income more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor. Size comes with advantages, including the ability to spread costs over a larger revenue base, greater access to capital markets, and the ability to take on larger deals. Although being so large also makes it harder to move the needle on the top and bottom lines, Realty Income is a differentiated company in the net-lease space.', ""That said, Realty Income's share price has fallen roughly 25% since hitting a recent peak in 2020. There are a host of reasons for this. The one that has lingered longest is probably interest rates. Rising rates are a headwind for real estate companies because they increase the cost of capital. Although property markets eventually adjust to higher rates, it can take some time."", ""Also, higher rates make income alternatives more attractive. For example, Realty Income's 5.2% dividend yield is only a touch higher than what might be available from a high-yield CD. Although there's a huge benefit in Realty Income's 29-year streak of annual dividend increases, owning a CD would allow investors to avoid the risk of owning a stock."", ""But it is important to recognize that the stock decline has pushed Realty Income's yield up toward the highest levels of the past decade. So for long-term dividend investors, it is probably an attractive investment choice."", ""There's a caveat here, however, when you look at Realty Income's stock over the short term. The stock is up around 15% over the past three months or so. That's largely driven by investors believing that the interest rate increases the Federal Reserve has made are at an end. Regardless of why, however, the opportunity to buy Realty Income just isn't as good as it was a few months ago."", ""That's a simple fact, highlighting that the yield, while high, is not the highest it's been over the past decade. So buying Realty Income today is more like buying a great company at a good price rather than buying a great company at a great price. If you missed the peak yield, don't assume that the buying opportunity is over. It is hard to complain too much about a 5%-plus yield at a time when the S&P 500 index is only offering 1.4% yield and the average REIT yield is 3.9%. So what if the opportunity isn't as good as it was? Realty Income still looks like an attractive dividend stock."", ""Wall Street is warming up to Realty Income again after dumping the stock as interest rates rose. It isn't as attractively valued today as it was just a few months ago, using yield as a rough gauge of valuation. But it is still attractively priced when you look over a longer time period and relative to other income options. If you are trying to build a portfolio filled with reliable dividend stocks, it should still be on your buy list."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

For example, a company experiencing financial difficulty might be at risk of reducing its dividend payment. In this scenario, it's common for investors to discount the share price, and therefore demand a higher yield on shares to account for the risk of a dividend cut."", 'The most rewarding dividend stocks can sustain, and ideally increase, their dividends. Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), and Realty Income (NYSE: O) are financially strong companies that can accomplish those goals.', ""What's more, last year's market sell-off leaves these top stocks trading well off their previous highs, pushing their dividend yields well above the S&P 500 average of 1.65%. Let's see why the following Motley Fool contributors believe these stocks are timely buys."", ""John Ballard (Kraft Heinz): Consumer staples have been a mixed bag for investors over the last few years. On one hand, these companies are struggling to grow sales volumes and relying mostly on price increases to grow their top lines. However, it's in challenging times like these when you can score a top dividend stock like Kraft Heinz at a high yield."", ""There's a lot to like about the Kraft Mac & Cheese owner. Sales only increased 1% year over year in the third quarter, but non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share grew 14%. Management is reinvesting the extra profits into the areas that it expects to drive more growth over the long term, such as better marketing and technology."", ""The investment in technology is already producing results. The company introduced new Heinz Remix machines last year that allow consumers to customize their own sauce flavors. These machines should be a solid growth driver for the company's foodservice business, which saw adjusted sales increase 9% year over year in the third quarter."", ""Another reason to like the stock is the company's international growth potential. Kraft Heinz saw adjusted sales in emerging markets increase by 10% year over year in the third quarter. As management continues investing in distribution and infrastructure in these markets, more growth is expected."", ""The stock is well off its previous highs and looks cheap, trading at a modest 12.6 times 2024 earnings estimates. The company paid out 65% of last year's earnings in dividends, bringing the dividend yield to an above-average 4.25%."", 'Jennifer Saibil (Home Depot): 2023 was not the year for home improvement companies. All home-related industries were feeling the impact of increased interest rates, which translated into high mortgage rates and a housing slowdown. On top of that, customers are generally staying away from expensive products and remodeling when every penny counts.', ""Despite its celebrated retail model, home improvement giant Home Depot didn't escape this depressing trend. Sales and comparable sales were down 3% from last year in the 2023 fiscal third quarter (ended Oct. 29). Even worse, earnings per share (EPS) dropped from $4.24 to $3.81."", 'The good news is that these are short-term trends. And the company is using this time to improve its platform and become more efficient.', ""It's highly focused on its digital platform and connecting the physical and digital shopping experiences, and digital orders increased 5% over last year in the quarter."", ""One of its initiatives is to get more orders fulfilled through stores. This saves time in getting orders to customers, since the company doesn't have to send them from regional warehouses. It also saves money for the company, which doesn't have to keep up as many costly distribution centers. Half of orders were fulfilled by stores in the third quarter. These actions position Home Depot for a strong rebound when conditions become more favorable."", ""Home Depot stock has crept up 8% over the past year, but it's still 14% off of its highs from two years ago. At its current price, Home Depot's dividend yields 2.33%."", ""Home Depot is the largest home improvement chain in the world, with more than 2,300 stores and strong digital channels. Contrary to what you might expect, it still sees plenty of growth opportunities, and it opened seven new stores in the third quarter alone. It's likely to bounce back big, and that could happen quickly if the interest rate environment changes. Now is a great time to buy shares."", 'Jeremy Bowman (Realty Income): Real Estate Income Trusts (REITs) are always a popular source of dividend income, and I can think of few that are more worth owning than Realty Income.', ""Realty Income specializes in single-tenant occupancy locations and operates through triple net leases, meaning that tenants bear the costs of insurance, maintenance, and property taxes. That helps streamline the company's business and reduce risk. Additionally, it favors renting to recession-proof retailers like Dollar General, 7-Eleven, and Walgreens, as well as related businesses, which also helps it generate stable cash flows."", 'Those companies tend to be stable and reliable business partners and are able to withstand economic shocks since they sell mostly consumer staples, or products that customers buy in any environment.', 'Realty Income has a long history of outperforming the S&P 500 on a total return basis, and the stock is nearly unbeatable as a dividend payer. Realty is one of the few stocks that pays a monthly dividend. It has a track record of paying 640 monthly dividends, and 104 consecutive quarterly dividend increases.', ""The company's business model makes it about as close to a sure thing as you can find for steady dividend growth on the stock market as it's able to pass along rent increases to its tenants, and its current dividend yield of 5.28% should please most investors. The stock should also benefit from falling interest rates, as investors are likely to move back into REITs for dividend income."", ""Now also looks like a good time to buy the stock as it's still trading 29% off its all-time high before the pandemic. Finally, the company's pending acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital should also provide further fodder for growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kraft Heinz right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kraft Heinz, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Kraft Heinz wasn't one of them.

With annual rent raises written into long-term leases, cash flows are highly predictable as long as tenants can make ends meet.', ""Realty Income's large and diverse portfolio has impressed the credit rating agencies. The REIT boasts an A3 rating from Moody's that allows it to borrow at significantly lower rates than its smaller peers."", 'Shares of Realty Income have risen since the Federal Open Market Committee indicated potential interest rate cuts in December.

Until recently, enforcement of the ban has been weak. From now on, though, popular flavored e-vapor products, such as Elf Bar, could get much harder to find.', ""Last year, Altria Group acquired NJOY, which is the only pod-based e-cigarette with marketing authorization from the FDA. With help from Altria's highly experienced legal team, NJOY filed suits against 34 manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of illicit e-vapor products last October."", 'In addition to sweeping litigation to keep illicit vaporizers off the U.S. market, the FDA joined forces with Customs and Border Protection in December.

Petro wants to show the world that a fossil fuel-reliant country can both decarbonise and be economically successful.', 'However, many of Colombia’s oil and gas industry representatives do not agree with Petro’s approach, rather seeing a future for fossil fuels so long as demand remains. Many from the industry think it is vital to continue producing oil and gas to support the Colombian economy for as long as possible, with several projects in the works to continue developing the industry.', 'Since coming into office, Petro has\xa0blocked new oil-and-gas drilling\xa0and spoken publicly on his aims to curb production in favour of renewable alternatives. This approach is somewhat controversial for a country that is the fifth-largest exporter of coal and an oil and gas producer with large untapped reserves. Yet, at the COP28 climate conference in December, Petro became the first leader of a large country and the first fossil fuel-producing state to endorse a call for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. This idea had previously only been supported by civil society and\xa0small island nations.', ""At COP28, Petro also announced the launch of a major national climate policy, aiming to provide $32 billion –equivalent to around\xa02.5 percent of the country's GDP\xa0– to projects in green transportation, clean energy, and climate adaptation. Unlike many of his Latin American counterparts, such as AMLO in Mexico and Madero in Venezuela, Petro does not see long-term oil and production as key to economic prosperity. And some think Petro could be among a new generation of leaders that put greater importance on the environment and the potential impact of climate change."", 'Petro is not the only Latin American leader to be shifting away from fossil fuels, with Brazil’s left-wing president Lula da Silva denouncing the continued drilling for oil and gas as part of his presidential campaign last year. The two countries are home to a large share of the Amazon Rainforest, which has gained increasing attention in recent years as climate activists and international organisations strive to protect important ecosystems in the region. During their short time in office, Petro and Lula\xa0have managed to significantly reduce deforestation in their countries.', 'Despite ambitious climate pledges, Lula has\xa0come under fire\xa0in recent weeks for announcing that Brazil would join OPEC+ as an observer. He said that the move was aimed at convincing some of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers to invest profits in the renewable energy sector. Yet, shortly after the announcement,\xa0the Brazilian government auctioned off more than 602 lots for oil and gas exploitation. Brazil is also planning oil and gas increases of 63 percent and 124 percent, respectively, between 2022 and 2032, to make Brazil the fourth-largest oil-producing country in the world. This has left many questioning Lula’s dedication to his climate pledges and wondering if other Latin American leaders, such as Petro, will follow his example.', 'Colombia has not yet halted oil and gas production and has several projects currently in the works. Last November, Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol and Brazilian partner Petrobras\xa0started drilling\xa0their Orca Norte 1 offshore appraisal well in the Tayrona block. The two firms hope to transport gas to the mainland via a new pipeline that would also run to the Chuchupa gas field. Ecopetrol is also working with Shell to develop their Gorgon discovery in the ultra-deepwater COL-5 block.', 'Onshore, Geopark and Hocol are developing Llanos 123, which is one of five exploration blocks the pair were awarded in a 2019 licensing round. Following two successful discoveries, the duo are hopeful for more over the next year. Meanwhile, the independent Canadian gas producer Canacol plans to drill the Pola-1 exploration well on the VMM-45 block in the first half of 2024, following three recent discoveries.', 'This month, Canadian firm Arrow Exploration Corp announced plans to drill 15 wells with a 2024 budget of $33.68 million. The company aims to expand the Tapir block and develop the Carrizales Norte (CN) field. It plans to drill three horizontal wells at CN, as well as four vertical wells. Arrow’s CEO, Marshall Abbott,\xa0stated“Arrow is proud of the work completed and results for 2023. Our average production rates more than doubled over the year and the company proved it was able to execute an aggressive capital work program.” He added, “The company believes it is capable of similar production growth in 2024. Arrow discovered a new, multizone core area and enjoyed a positive step change in reserves. Arrow was also able to complete a 100 square [kilometre] 3D seismic program and develop numerous new prospects.”', 'Colombia’s President Petro has high hopes for the oil-rich country’s green transition, following up on climate pledges made during his 2022 electoral campaign. Petro made his stance clear at COP28, suggesting that he hopes to make Colombia one of the few oil majors to rapidly shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives.

Petro wants to show the world that a fossil fuel-reliant country can both decarbonise and be economically successful.', 'However, many of Colombia’s oil and gas industry representatives do not agree with Petro’s approach, rather seeing a future for fossil fuels so long as demand remains. Many from the industry think it is vital to continue producing oil and gas to support the Colombian economy for as long as possible, with several projects in the works to continue developing the industry.', 'Since coming into office, Petro has\xa0blocked new oil-and-gas drilling\xa0and spoken publicly on his aims to curb production in favour of renewable alternatives. This approach is somewhat controversial for a country that is the fifth-largest exporter of coal and an oil and gas producer with large untapped reserves. Yet, at the COP28 climate conference in December, Petro became the first leader of a large country and the first fossil fuel-producing state to endorse a call for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. This idea had previously only been supported by civil society and\xa0small island nations.', ""At COP28, Petro also announced the launch of a major national climate policy, aiming to provide $32 billion –equivalent to around\xa02.5 percent of the country's GDP\xa0– to projects in green transportation, clean energy, and climate adaptation. Unlike many of his Latin American counterparts, such as AMLO in Mexico and Madero in Venezuela, Petro does not see long-term oil and production as key to economic prosperity. And some think Petro could be among a new generation of leaders that put greater importance on the environment and the potential impact of climate change."", 'Petro is not the only Latin American leader to be shifting away from fossil fuels, with Brazil’s left-wing president Lula da Silva denouncing the continued drilling for oil and gas as part of his presidential campaign last year. The two countries are home to a large share of the Amazon Rainforest, which has gained increasing attention in recent years as climate activists and international organisations strive to protect important ecosystems in the region. During their short time in office, Petro and Lula\xa0have managed to significantly reduce deforestation in their countries.', 'Despite ambitious climate pledges, Lula has\xa0come under fire\xa0in recent weeks for announcing that Brazil would join OPEC+ as an observer. He said that the move was aimed at convincing some of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers to invest profits in the renewable energy sector. Yet, shortly after the announcement,\xa0the Brazilian government auctioned off more than 602 lots for oil and gas exploitation. Brazil is also planning oil and gas increases of 63 percent and 124 percent, respectively, between 2022 and 2032, to make Brazil the fourth-largest oil-producing country in the world. This has left many questioning Lula’s dedication to his climate pledges and wondering if other Latin American leaders, such as Petro, will follow his example.', 'Colombia has not yet halted oil and gas production and has several projects currently in the works. Last November, Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol and Brazilian partner Petrobras\xa0started drilling\xa0their Orca Norte 1 offshore appraisal well in the Tayrona block. The two firms hope to transport gas to the mainland via a new pipeline that would also run to the Chuchupa gas field. Ecopetrol is also working with Shell to develop their Gorgon discovery in the ultra-deepwater COL-5 block.', 'Onshore, Geopark and Hocol are developing Llanos 123, which is one of five exploration blocks the pair were awarded in a 2019 licensing round. Following two successful discoveries, the duo are hopeful for more over the next year. Meanwhile, the independent Canadian gas producer Canacol plans to drill the Pola-1 exploration well on the VMM-45 block in the first half of 2024, following three recent discoveries.', 'This month, Canadian firm Arrow Exploration Corp announced plans to drill 15 wells with a 2024 budget of $33.68 million. The company aims to expand the Tapir block and develop the Carrizales Norte (CN) field. It plans to drill three horizontal wells at CN, as well as four vertical wells. Arrow’s CEO, Marshall Abbott,\xa0stated“Arrow is proud of the work completed and results for 2023. Our average production rates more than doubled over the year and the company proved it was able to execute an aggressive capital work program.” He added, “The company believes it is capable of similar production growth in 2024. Arrow discovered a new, multizone core area and enjoyed a positive step change in reserves. Arrow was also able to complete a 100 square [kilometre] 3D seismic program and develop numerous new prospects.”', 'Colombia’s President Petro has high hopes for the oil-rich country’s green transition, following up on climate pledges made during his 2022 electoral campaign. Petro made his stance clear at COP28, suggesting that he hopes to make Colombia one of the few oil majors to rapidly shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives. Nevertheless, Colombia’s oil industry is continuing to expand, with several projects planned for the mid-term.

For instance, it’s the main driver behind degens chasing the highs of meme coins like BONK or dogwifhat, which truly serve little economic function beyond speculation.', 'But to write off bitcoin simply as a turn of the roulette wheel with $800 billion on the table is to willingly mislead oneself. You don’t have to personally believe what bitcoiners believe to take their arguments seriously, for fear of mockery or ostracization (FOMOO) by your crypto-skeptic peers, Jeff.', 'To be fair, Sommer did tip his hat to the technology behind Bitcoin, i.e. b l o c k c h a i n, to hedge his own argument.

Concepts embedded in Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies could have real-world importance at some point…”', 'This was not Sommer’s only completely original and novel thought, he also steadfastly argued that cryptocurrency is a “misnomer” because cryptocurrencies, despite maybe one day having “real-world” utility somewhere, are not really “currencies.” And, he said, the comparison between bitcoin and gold is off because gold has historical “cache.”', ""As the great and powerful Satoshi Nakamoto once said, “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.” At this point it’s not even worth addressing these extremely tired arguments, which seem to be carried out by seasoned journalists everytime crypto notches some victory."", 'But considering that they’re brand new, I’ll try to do Sommer a solid and get him up-to-date on why interest in bitcoin ETFs is more than FOMO.', 'First, there is Bitcoin’s philosophical proposition — the idea that there ought to be a global, stateless monetary network available to all. Often called a libertarian wet-dream, the Bitcoin vision is so simple it actually slots neatly into a range of political philosophies — from globalizing neoconservatism to historical Marxism, just not anything truly authoritarian.', 'Again, you don’t have to buy into the rising trend towards populism to take an interest in it.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', ""During the five years of share price growth, Motorola Solutions moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the Motorola Solutions share price has gained 88% in three years. In the same period, EPS is up 31% per year.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.', 'A pure monopoly, by definition, refers to a company with no competition whatsoever – a sole provider of a particular product or service. An illustration of this was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which, at one point, stood as the exclusive seller of software and operating systems for computers, leaving consumers with only one option for these products. The connection between monopolies and U.S. consumers is rife with contradictions. Americans harbor suspicions about companies that wield a dominant influence over their industries, closely monitoring how these entities leverage their size and market dominance to maximize profits. Paradoxically, while Americans express concerns about monopolistic power, they readily embrace the advantages associated with economies of scale. Large market leaders are often preferred over small family businesses attempting to compete, fostering an environment that encourages rather than discourages the expansion of market share by substantial corporations.', 'Monopolies wield significant pricing power, a crucial factor that investor Warren Buffett carefully considers when selecting stocks for his globally tracked portfolio. During his 2011 testimony before the US Congress, Buffett cited pricing power as a vital criterion for evaluating a business. He emphasized that a business with the ability to increase prices without losing market share to competitors exhibits a robust business model.', 'While pure monopolies are rare, some contemporary companies exhibit what can be termed near-monopolies. Benefiting from economies of scale, these corporations establish formidable barriers that discourage new entrants from challenging their dominance. Market leaders like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have penetrated a sector and captured a substantial portion of the market are deemed as some of the best monopoly stocks in that regard. In a bid to expand their market share and revenue, these companies often diversify their product offerings. While they may allows some space for competition, companies like the ones mentioned above boast considerable market power, exerting significant influence over the industry.', ""In theory, a near-monopoly may not pose a problem, but in practice, such a system may not work in the best interests of consumers unless it is closely monitored. In the absence of competition, monopolies may set excessive prices, offer poor-quality products, and eliminate alternatives to maximize their own profits. While the law doesn't outright prohibit monopolies, various regulations have been implemented to ensure that such companies operate fairly. The Sherman Antitrust Act is a significant piece of legislation used to break up companies that hinder competition and prevent mergers and acquisitions that could lead to a virtual monopoly. While these regulations may limit the profits of monopolies, investors often find these stocks appealing. The substantial market share held by monopolies is likely to contribute to growth and value over time, mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with investing in any security."", ""A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting."", 'Our Methodology', ""We've identified 11 stocks in the US that exhibit near-monopoly characteristics based on their substantial market share. Several of these companies are part of the FAANG group. The major technology corporations within this list maintain a dominant market presence across various sectors, such as cloud computing, e-commerce, mobile application services, mobile operating systems, search engines, social networking, and web browsers. Additionally, the remaining stocks in the selection assert near-monopoly positions in diverse sectors, including alcoholic beverages, personal credit rating, and satellite radio.

With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield.

After all, the software giant's climb toward $3 trillion of market capitalization has been fantastic, punctuated recently by its overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable business. It pays well to be along for that kind of ride, even if you were relatively late to the growth party."", ""The software giant's business looks much different today than it did 25 years ago, and tech trends will surely change many more times over the next several decades. Yet, the big question for investors going forward is whether the stock can still produce market-beating returns, given Microsoft's lofty valuation perch today. Let's look at the factors that could make this stock a positive force in the long run for your retirement portfolio."", ""While investors can't know which tech trends will dominate the industry in several years, they can feel reasonably confident that Microsoft will continue to be a leading player as those trends emerge. It already has excellent exposure to many growth niches, including cloud enterprise services, video games, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. That diversity also boosts its value to large customers, who are increasingly looking for a comprehensive software solutions provider."", ""Sure, you might see much faster growth by owning a specialist, like cybersecurity expert Palo Alto Networks, that is at an earlier chapter in its growth story. This maker of powerful firewalls and cloud security products is targeting many years of above-average sales gains ahead as more businesses look to protect their digital assets and workflows. Yet, Microsoft already has a valuable relationship with most of the world's largest enterprises. It's not a stretch to believe the software titan can build on that formidable market share position in the coming years and decades."", ""Microsoft's financial strength is another huge factor in its favor. The company is sitting on over $140 billion of cash as of late September. It generated $30 billion of operating cash flow in just the last quarter, too, as operating profit jumped a healthy 26% higher year-over-year."", ""A lot of value is conferred by those ample financial resources. All that cash means Microsoft can more easily survive a market downturn than its smaller peers. It can invest aggressively in tech innovations, as it has been doing with AI lately. And if it misses any emerging opportunity, it can use cash to fund acquisitions or partnerships that keep it in the leadership position in the next computing era. Most tech companies don't have anything approaching that level of flexibility."", ""As you might expect, Microsoft's stock is priced at a premium that reflects most of the key advantages detailed above. An investor must pay over 13 times annual sales for its shares, which isn't far from the pandemic high that investors saw back in early 2022. In comparison, you could own Amazon for a relative steal of about 3 times revenue, although the e-commerce giant's profit margins aren't nearly as lucrative as Microsoft's."", ""Microsoft's high valuation and market capitalization mean investors' returns from here will necessarily be constrained. Yet, the stock could still play a positive role in a retirement portfolio that aims to crack the $1 million mark. Microsoft investors can expect the company to lead the tech shifts ahead while capitalizing on its entrenched position in the massive global software industry. In other words, the tech giant has a good shot at producing more millionaire shareholders in the coming decades."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Knavish', ""Thank you, Jonathan, and congratulations on your new role, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial performance, and then I will move to our outlook. In the fourth quarter, the PPG team delivered strong financial results, including record fourth quarter sales of $4.4 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.53. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of delivering record sales as we continue to benefit from organic sales growth. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was 25% higher year-over-year driven by aggregated segment margin improvement of 260 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to be laser-focused on driving margin improvement. Our results reflect our continuing growth trends and strong execution in several of our leading and technology advantage businesses, which culminated in record fourth quarter sales in the Aerospace, Automotive OEM and Automotive Refinish businesses with strong performance in the Protective & Marine and PPG Mexico Architectural Coatings businesses. Our year-over-year sales volume trend improved compared to recent quarters, decreasing less than 1% year-over-year. We continue to experience lower global industrial production along with soft U.S. and European architectural demand, especially for DIY-related products. Notable for us during the quarter was China, where despite a lethargic general economy, we achieved high single-digit percentage volume growth, reflecting our strong mix of businesses in the country. In addition, we delivered flat year-over-year volumes in Europe as we see economic stabilization in the region, albeit at lower absolute demand levels. Our selling prices were about 2% higher with both segments delivering positive price led by the Performance Coatings segment. We expect total company selling prices to remain modestly positive in the first quarter of 2024 as new selling price increases have been implemented in several of our businesses. We also benefited from further normalization of our operations as we experienced stabilization of both upstream and downstream supply chains and order patterns. From a supply perspective, the vast majority of our suppliers have more than sufficient capacity heading into 2024. We started the year laser-focused on margin recovery and the fourth quarter marked our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating segment margin improvement. And as I mentioned, fourth quarter aggregate segment operating margins increased 260 basis points year-over-year and full year increased 310 basis points. We also achieved our second key priority for the year by delivering excellent cash generation of nearly $900 million during the fourth quarter, which was up over $300 million on a year-over-year basis, leading to record full year cash generation of over $2.4 billion. We significantly reduced working capital by a total of about $600 million on a sequential quarterly basis and this includes the benefit from a partial reduction of our inventory levels. However, we still ended the year with higher inventory levels from a historical perspective, primarily in raw materials and will continue to reduce inventory in the first half of 2024. The strong cash generated drove a reduction in net interest expense by about $20 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we repaid some high variable cost debt during the quarter. Additionally, we repurchased $100 million of stock in the fourth quarter, which essentially offset dilution. Now a few comments on the full year 2023, as we communicated at the beginning of 2023, my priorities included margin recovery, strong cash generation and further strengthening of our capabilities to support our customers' productivity and sustainability needs, which will result in higher PPG organic growth. Coming into 2023, we had a high degree of conviction that our global business portfolio would prove resilient while anticipating a challenging economic environment, and these clearly played out during the year. For the full year, I'm proud of our team's execution against our strategic objectives as it resulted in delivery of record sales, record adjusted EPS and record operating cash flow. And our sales performance was led by continued selling price execution to offset significant multiyear cost inflation. Our year-over-year earnings' growth was driven by these improved selling prices coupled with moderating input costs and cost structure reductions stemming from our cost management and restructuring initiatives. This resulted in improved margins in both segments. Our businesses delivered innovative and value-added products and solutions to our customers, and this enabled several of our businesses to set all-time annual sales records, including our Aerospace, Auto OEM, Automotive Refinish, Architectural Mexico and the Protective & Marine Coatings businesses. Our enterprise growth initiatives delivered about $150 million of incremental sales in the first year, including strong growth from selling our innovative products for electric vehicles as well as our share gains in powder coatings. In automotive refinish, customer adoption of our industry-leading digital tools accelerated yielding nearly 2,000 net body shop wins. These digital tools include our Link Services and moonwalk mixing machines, both of which are best-in-class and are focused on improving body shop productivity. In Mexico, we further advanced cross-selling of our valued products, including protective coatings and certain light industrial coatings through the best-in-class distribution network of nearly 5,200 concessionaire locations. Finally, our strong focus on the customer drove share gains across several businesses including expansion of our architectural coatings products at Walmart. Strategically, we conducted an ongoing review of both our product and business portfolios leading to the divestiture of several non-core assets including our European and Australian Traffic Solutions businesses, along with the recently announced strategic alternatives review of the silicas product business. In a variety of cases, we also simplified and improved our product offering, allowing us to reduce complexity and drive down working capital. Finally, these actions plus strong balance sheet management resulted in record full year 2023 cash generation of $2.4 billion. So overall, we achieved excellent financial results in 2023 and are anticipating improving from this higher base in 2024. We remain confident that we will deliver positive sales volume in 2024, including benefits from China, India and Mexico. We've delivered share gains in several businesses, including Auto Refinish, Packaging and the Protective & Marine Coatings businesses. We will also execute on our more than $250 million order backlog in Aerospace drive further growth in our well-positioned businesses in Mexico and further expand the benefits of our key growth initiatives, including powder coatings, electric vehicle products and digital solutions. We will drive further improvement of our operating margins aided by the sales volume growth leverage and our initiatives that drive manufacturing productivity following several years of supply chain and other disruptions. Lastly, we entered 2024 with a strong balance sheet, which provides us with the flexibility for further shareholder value creation going forward, including funding organic growth initiatives, appropriate acquisitions, debt repayment and share repurchases. Now I'll comment on our first quarter outlook. We expect to deliver sequential adjusted EPS growth from $1.53 per share in Q4 2023 to a range of $1.80 to $1.87 per share in Q1 of 2024, an increase of 20% at the midpoint of the range. We anticipate global industrial production to remain soft, and our year-over-year sales volume performance will be unfavorably impacted by the approximate $40 million nonrecurring Walmart customer load-in that occurred in the first quarter of 2023. Also, the timing of the Easter holiday will shift some sales into the second quarter. Despite these difficult year-over-year comparison items, we expect our first quarter sales volume will be flat overall aided by positive sales volume growth in our Aerospace, Protective & Marine and Packaging Coatings businesses. We project solid growth in our Auto OEM business in Asia Pacific where we expect to drive solid volume growth in China, led by our strong positioning with the electric vehicle OEM producers. Additionally, we expect to deliver organic sales growth through our best-in-class Mexico distribution platform. We anticipate overall company selling prices to remain positive as some modest declines in our industrial reporting segment related to a small portion of customer-based index contracts will be more than offset by targeted selling price increases in our Performance Coatings segment. First quarter comparisons also include declines in certain transitory European and energy-related pricing indices that were put in place during the period of extremely high energy prices in the region. These particular price declines are offset by lower purchased energy costs for our facility. The net selling price increases, along with various productivity initiatives will serve to offset somewhat higher expected wage inflation in 2024, especially in emerging regions. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply remains ample, and we will continue to realize benefits from moderating input costs including further recognition of savings stemming from working down our higher inventories as we progress through 2024. We will diligently manage our costs and expect to deliver manufacturing and productivity gains supported by a more stable supply chain and customer order patterns. We anticipate more moderate year-over-year earnings' growth in the first quarter associated with some of the transitory items I mentioned earlier. However, we are confident that we will deliver our commitment for full year earnings' growth of around 10% at our forecast guidance midpoint. Finally, I want to thank our more than 50,000 employees for making it happen by delivering excellent 2023 financial results and positioning the company for growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond for the benefit of all stakeholders. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks. And now would you please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) First question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.', 'David L. Begleiter', ""Tim and Vince, do you expect total company pricing to be up in '24? And I presume that if it is, it's a positive performance than industrial. Within performance, are you seeing pressure from big box retailers to lower your paint prices?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Dave, thanks for the question. We will have positive company price for full year 2024. Again, to your point, largely from Performance Coatings and more targeted beyond that. As far as big box pricing, most of the big box pricing is contractual and so I wouldn't say that you'll see a significant movement in that pricing throughout the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO.', 'John Patrick McNulty', ""So maybe a little bit more color on the raw material front. Can you speak to relative to what you reported in the fourth quarter, how much lower our raw materials that you're buying right now? Because it does look like things are held up a little bit because of FIFO and also some of your destocking. Is it just the mid-single-digit dip that you guided to for 1Q? Or is there more to it than that? And how should we be thinking about that?"", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Yes, John, this is Vince. If you look throughout all of last year, we continued to accrue larger benefits from the moderation of raw materials. We will remind everybody raw material costs are still higher on a multiyear basis by a significant amount. As Tim mentioned, most of our suppliers have more than ample capacity, and it's certainly a focus for them to pick up more volume. We expect some incrementally better invoice benefits from raw materials, and then that will eventually flow through our P&L as we go through the year. But year-over-year, we expect some incrementally beneficial invoice pricing."", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""And I would just add -- this is Tim, John. Thanks for the question. I would just add that fundamentally, upstream of us, it's still a pretty long environment. No issues on our end from availability and I think that's a good indicator for us as we move through the year as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.', 'Ghansham Panjabi', ""Tim, I want to go back to the question that was asked earlier about pricing. As you kind of zoom out a bit, price for PPG as a whole has been up over 20% since 2021, and a lot of that is just enormity of the raw material cycle and so on and so forth, which seems to have changed significantly. Your confidence on pricing holding or being up in 2024 and maybe even beyond that, is that based partly on the mix change in the portfolio with Aerospace and so on and so forth? Or is there something unique about the industry structure now that's going to allow you to hold on to the enormity of these price increases, but (inaudible) doing what they're doing."", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""It's not a mix issue for us, Ghansham. It's more -- first of all, I'm very pleased with how we've continued to hold price, even just closing out fourth quarter with another 2% increment. Again, we'll be positive in Q1, the confidence level is more because of a couple of things. One, to Vince's point earlier, raws are still quite elevated. We're talking about coming off of extremely high peaks. And so -- but they're still quite elevated from, say, 2019. So we don't see what I would characterize as massive deflation by any means. And the confidence level as we move through the year, I'll talk Performance Coatings. We -- as you know well, we get price almost irrespective there of the raw material environment because of the unique value proposition that we deliver in Performance where we're such a small part of the cost structure of our customers from a pure paint standpoint, but the value-add outside of the can that we deliver is such a big significant impact on their cost structure. So that's a very different model there. And on industrial side, where maybe it is more proportionate to raw material increases or decreases. We just don't see the long supply dynamic upstream of us changing dramatically as we move through the year. When you think about, for example, China, just not having a V-shaped rebound and China is a big consumer of raws. So we expect a more moderate environment as we move through 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.', 'Patrick Duffy Fischer', ""Two questions. First is cash flow as a percent of EBITDA, if you hit the midpoint of your guide this year, EBITDA should be up about $250 million. Should we expect a commensurate move in cash flow would be one and then two, in the Auto OE business, you guided to down low single digits coming into Q4. You did mid-single digits up, again, guiding down in Q1, is that just conservatism? Because when you look at the auto numbers, it seems like Auto OE should be better than that unless there's some pricing in there. So can you just talk about what you're seeing in Auto OE for Q1 price versus volume?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Yes. Duffy, this is Tim. I'll take -- I'll do the auto one. I'll let Vince do the cash versus EBITDA one. Auto had a really good year for us last year, and we are well positioned for what we view as a multiyear recovery. So I personally continue to be bullish on auto as we look into the full year 2024. When you look at our Q1, and we went from up mid-single digits in Q4, and we're projecting low single digits down in Q1, a lot of that, if you go back to last year, we were a strong double digit up in Q1 of 2023. And also, yes, there is some, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have some of our index pricing rolling back and that has some impact. But I would not -- personally, I'm not overconcerned about auto volumes as we move through the year. I think total builds were 89-point-something last year. I believe there is some incremental upside to that as we move through 2024. Our share position is good. Our China auto position is really good. And as you know, out of the 90 million new builds, about 30 million will come out of China. So overall, feeling good about auto. There's a little bit of a year-over-year comp soft point and a little bit of index pricing rolling off in Q1."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Just to add, as we talked several times, Duffy, on auto, acceleration in China helps us from an EV perspective as well. So we have more content on any traditional EV than we do otherwise. So that's a -- proper for us in PPG in particular. To your cash flow question, yes, I think the short answer is typically EBITDA would certainly serve as a proxy for cash flow, plus or minus. We have the last couple of years -- expanded answer is we have the last couple of years, had working capital movement that has either helped or hurt the cash flow on a transitory basis. We do have, as Tim alluded to in his opening comments, probably a couple of hundred million dollars of excess raw materials in inventory. We're going to work that down in 2024. So that will have a cash flow implication for us in a positive manner. But I think generally, what you're saying in EBITDA and cash flow should be -- the movement should be consistent."", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Yes. And Duffy, this is Tim. I'm going to come back with one additional -- Vince mentioned the EV situation. And we all see the headlines on EVs, but that's largely U.S. and Europe right now. And as you know, 2/3 of the world's EVs are made in China, and that content number, if you look at the average PPG content across the EV space for 2023, was up by 20%. So our content per EV built was up by 20% in 2023. So that bodes well for us as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.', 'Stephen V. Byrne', ""Tim, you've been involved in this partnership with Home Depot for a long time. I'm curious to hear your view whether it's going better or worse than what you had expected? And any potential forward in structuring in that relationship in 2024? And if you don't mind, can you just comment on SG&A for 2024? It seemed to really jump in the fourth quarter. Were there some unusuals in there like with your strategic actions? Any comments on that, how should we forecast that going forward?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Good morning, Steve. There was -- the quick answer on your second question is there were some unusuals and Vince will take that. But your first one, the Home Depot relationship and progress on the Pro program is going as expected. Quite frankly, the challenge that we have is that as it's growing off relatively small denominator, as you know, it's still being offset by the challenges on the DIY side. DIY is still the Home Depot and the Glynn brand and Olympic brands are still a critical part of our DIY Omnichannel strategy going forward. And unfortunately, the negatives there from a volume standpoint are offsetting the good progress that we have on our Pro Omnichannel between the Home Depot and our own network. If I look at -- just to give some perspective, so Q4, despite the challenges out there, we were up low single digits on our Pro Omnichannel. And our sell out with the Home Depot was one of our better quarters yet. So we're making progress there. But our DIY Omnichannel, which includes not only what we do with the Home Depot, but also our big partner in the Midwest, our DIY remain down. So that's the issue there, but the momentum continues to grow. It's -- as I've said many times, we are building a business model for the future. That's brick-and-mortar light and it's a marathon, not a sprint, and we continue to kick off miles on the marathon. So good progress."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Yes, Steve, on the overhead, I'm going to just look at the whole year. There's always movement between quarters within a year. But on a full year basis, our overhead was up about $380 million. About 1/3 of that is directly correlated to the increase in sales, whether it be volume, price or FX. So on a percentage basis, if you just do the percents comparison, you get about 1/3 of that directly related to our sales movement. Another 1/3 of that on a year-over-year basis, and then Tim alluded to this in his opening remarks, we did have a higher shareholder based and performance-based compensation and the reminder that in the prior year, we had much lower compensation. So kind of a doubling effect on a year-over-year basis. And the final third, roughly $100 million or so was inflation and the remainder of that would be growth initiatives for some of the key programs we won throughout the year and including our clinic's growth, et cetera."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Roberts with Mizuho.', 'John Ezekiel E. Roberts', ""Is your China strength primarily China for China? Or is it the strong exports of cars that we're seeing out of China?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""John, it's both. But I mean the vast majority of the vehicles that we paint in China stay in China. The exciting part on the export side is the largest producer of EVs now in the world, a Chinese producer is beginning to export. So that will just be incremental upside but the vast majority of the cars that we paint in China stay in China."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Yes. And John, I think for our book of business, again, 2023, especially at the beginning part of 2023, it was a tougher year. We're starting to see industrial and some of our other businesses kind of turned the corner in the fourth quarter and now heading into 2024."", 'Timothy M. Knavish', 'One more job from John Bruno, outside of auto OEM, a very high percentage of the coatings we sell in China are for products that stay in China.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS.', 'Joshua David Spector', ""So I wanted to follow up on industrial pricing. So when you're talking about down modestly for the first quarter year-on-year, maybe it's 50, 100 basis points, I guess, in the frame of that, does that -- is it stabilized at that level through the year? Or do you expect it to decline? So kind of separating the energy give-back from maybe some of the index pricing. And I guess when you look at this longer term then, what does this mean for margin potential for the Industrial segment? Are we looking at more normal incrementals from here to price raw still play into that? Or what are the factors that maybe move the margins up from the current level beyond this year?"", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Yes, Josh, let me start, and I'll let Tim add some color here. But we did. I just want to remind people, and again, we talked about this in opening comments in our prepared remarks we released last evening. Just a reminder, in Q1 last year in Europe, that was exceedingly high. The energy costs, natural gas costs were $30 to $40 per MMBtu depending on the day. Most companies, PPG included, invoked surcharges to pass those through that. We're lapping that in Q1 of this year. That is 1/3 to half of our price decline in the first quarter in the Industrial Coatings segment. And the remainder is organic based on the indices that Tim was talking about. Tim, you have some color here?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Yes, I think the question about margin expansion beyond what Vince described in pricing is the volume leverage will be significant on the Industrial segment because that's the segment that really got hit the hardest during COVID and COVID recovery. And so we've still got significant margin upside driven by volume leverage. The other side, if you go back to our CEO Day in May in New York, we pointed to about $150 million to $200 million of manufacturing productivity gains that we had line of sight to in the coming years, really, not just to get back to where we were pre-COVID, but also as we modernize, automate, digitize our operations. So those will really be the 2 levers that get us to the next horizon on margin largely across the Industrial segment, but somewhat also in the Performance Coatings side."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with VRP.', 'Kevin William McCarthy', ""Tim, would you elaborate on your volume outlook that's embedded in your '24 guide? Would you expect volumes to be flat or up a little bit? Part of the reason I ask is we've seen many chemical companies suffer from volumes that are trending well below real GDP. And so as you look across your portfolio and survey and forecast, do you think we'll see convergence in 2024? Or are there pockets of residual destocking or other headwinds that might make that more ambitious?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""So first of all, we're going to have positive volume in 2024 for the year. I would -- our sales, we said, are going to be up low single digits. We might have to start putting a fourth letter there because I think the -- I'm sorry, the volume will be a little higher on the low single-digit side and the price will be a little lower on the low single-digit side. But we have volume momentum for really 5 quarters now, minus 3, minus 2, a little lighter, minus 2. Our fourth quarter, we rounded it up to minus 1. It was actually less than minus 1. We're looking at a 0 for Q1. But -- and that includes the impact of the Walmart load-in. It includes the shift from -- of Easter from one quarter to the next. So we have momentum on volume, some of it just because of the diversity of our portfolio and where we participate but some of it because of the growth initiatives that we've worked on throughout 2023, where we've picked up share that will start to kick in this year. I think about our Packaging Coatings business, our Industrial Coatings business, our Refinish Coatings business. So it's really the positivity on volume is one even though they've had negative numbers in front of them for much of 2023, we do have volume momentum. We see it flipping in early 2024. And it's a combination of strength of our portfolio positioning and execution on our growth initiatives."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""And just a couple of other items of note, Kevin, we expect Europe to stabilize, which really reflects a lack of a destock. We experienced a destocking, especially in the first half of 2023, and that's -- we feel that ran its course. So stabilization in Europe, which has been a negative for us. And again, China on the 2023 first half basis was light. So again, as that normalizes -- the pandemic effect of that hopefully is behind us. And as that normalizes, we can provide us with some uplift. And we are -- we do have this backlog that Tim alluded to in the opening remarks in Aerospace. So we continue to produce more products at our manufacturing sites and that we expect that to continue to grow throughout the year to work down that backlog, which is more than a half a year backlog for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Leithead with Barclays.', 'Michael James Leithead', ""I wanted to ask around cash deployment. Your net leverage ended the year towards the lower end of where it's historically been. I guess, 3 very brief questions. One, can you just remind us roughly what target leverage you intend to maintain? Two, how does the M&A market look today, say, relative to returning more cash to shareholders this year? And then third, I think you're guiding to $15 million of interest in 1Q, but about $95 million for the year. So why does that step up so much? I'm assuming that takes into consideration of more cash deployment. Could you just help clarify that?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Mike, it's Tim. I'll start. Target, we don't write a target in pen because it changes with time, depending on where we are in the execution of our strategy. We're doing some portfolio things. You've seen some announcements in that regard. And where we are on our strength of our balance sheet, very strong right now, but it would be different as the environment changes. M&A, it has -- it was a little quiet there for some time. We're seeing some things come across our desk now. Nothing huge in the pipeline, but we're seeing some assets come across, and we're evaluating those. Overall, on the strength of the balance sheet and deployment, consistent with what I said throughout last year, #1, we're going to focus on continuing to generate strong cash. That gives us a great deal of flexibility. I'm very proud of what the team did in 2023. Just to be very clear, we will not let cash sit on the balance sheet. We'll do what we need to do from dividends. We've got some good organic growth investments that we'll invest in. Love to do some shareholder value accretion -- accretive acquisitions. And if that doesn't come along, then we'll return cash by buying shares. We did some in Q4 for the first time in a long time. And if we've got excess cash sitting on the balance sheet, you can be assured that, that's what we'll do. Now Q1, we're sitting with a lot of cash right now, but we typically consume significant cash in Q1. And so we'll be a little cautious here in Q1 so that we don't get back into paying high interest cost debt, which we just got out of. But beyond that, you should expect us to not let the cash sit there."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Yes. Let me just add. This is Vince. I just want to reemphasize the key comment Tim said, we prefer a strong balance sheet. Due to the optionality it gives us on many fronts, we feel where we are today, we don't need to let cash grow. We will consume cash through April. That's our traditional seasonality of our businesses. So the $1.5 billion that sits on the balance sheet, we will consume through April. That allows us to not enter the debt markets as significantly as we normally would for commercial paper. At this time of the year, we're typically adding commercial paper throughout -- from now through the end of April. So that's why our interest cost in Q1 will be lower because we're going to use the cash on hand to fund that seasonal inventory build. That cash will then -- we typically generate strong cash in the back half of the year, which is we'll deplete our interest income. And then as we generate that strong cash in the back half of the year, we'll look at other uses."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.', 'Jeffrey John Zekauskas', ""I was wondering whether you could comment on the direction of titanium dioxide prices? Secondly, you make a fuss over the difference between or you make a fuss over your LIFO inventories. So if you would valued things on LIFO instead of FIFO? What might the difference have been at the end of the year? And then finally, in your accounts payable and accrued liabilities line, your year-over-year increase, that is a benefit, was about $380 million. And sequentially, maybe it was $250 million. Now you guys don't disaggregate accounts payable from accrued liabilities.Can you explain what's going on there in that many, many companies had much lower accounts payable this year, and it seems to have really worked in the other direction for you?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Jeff, it's Tim. I'll take titanium dioxide question. And Vince, you can take the more finance-related questions there. TiO2, we see very good availability. We see a long supply chain upstream of us, it's still quite long. And so we're seeing some modestly lower pricing on TiO2 than what we would have seen last year. It's not down as much as some other parts of our basket, but it's definitely down from where we were last year, Jeff. And on TiO2, in addition to pricing, I do have to mention that a key part of our strategy is to continue the research work that we do to reduce our titanium dioxide content in our formulas every year without sacrificing any performance. And our team has done a great job there. We're down about 1% per formula over the last several years, and we achieved that again in 2023."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Yes, Jeff, on the balance sheet questions, I'm not going to be able to calculate the FIFO, LIFO impact on the fly here. We can just remind everybody, we're at 75% or so FIFO, the difference between, again, the invoice cost and what we're realizing on the income statement for raw material moderation, that is tens of millions of dollars if we move that to a FIFO.I can't calculate it precisely. As it relates to payables, for us, we had a couple of items in the fourth quarter. Our tax provisioning is about $100 million higher. We ended the year on a weekend -- 2-day weekend. So our accounts payable is higher because of that. There's natural FX in that number on a year-over-year basis. And we had, as you saw, an environmental special for about $30 million where we accrued $30 million for future environmental spending. And we talked about the compensation increase in the fourth quarter. So those are the big elements in our payables on a year-over-year basis."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.', 'Vincent Stephen Andrews', ""A few quick ones from me. In the first quarter, I get the timing shift of Easter, but February also had an extra day this year. So does that not offset the Easter impact and then also on TiO2, how much Chinese TiO2 are you guys buying these days? And how much of it is in Europe? And have you changed any purchasing patterns as a function of the EU's investigation to Chinese imports? And then lastly, the Pro Architectural business has been holding up an awful lot better than the DIY, just in a similar -- fortunately, far enough away from COVID now that I think we should be able to have a conversation about what's driving the DIY weakness other than just a pull forward of volumes. And what's keeping the Pro business so high or so strong because it just seems like there's a disconnect between sort of Pro demand being there, but DIY being so weak.So if you could help with those 3 things, I'd appreciate it."", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Okay, Vince, this is Tim. On the Q1. Yes, I'd say you're correct. There is an extra day in February. I think the negativity of Easter impacts that more significantly in 1 day because particularly some parts of the world, Europe, vacations before, some vacations after, other parts of the world. We do have -- Easter time is typically a good month for us in Mexico. And so it's more significant than the 1 day. But you are correct. Also on Q1 though, we have -- in addition to the Easter impact, you do have that customer load-in that we mentioned and the energy pricing issue that Vince mentioned earlier. On the Pro DIY, first of all, DIY remains down. And yes, some of it, I don't know if we could put a time stamp exactly on it, but some of it, you could call it COVID -- post-COVID hangover, as people did a lot of pull forward, I think now it's more general inflation and general consumer spending and confidence on remodeling at home. And some of it is existing home resale too where sellers -- DIY sellers will paint their house, DIY buyers will paint their house. So I do think some of it is related to what's happening with existing home sales as well. But I do think it's some combination of that and just overall inflation and how it's hitting the average consumer's pocket book and the decisions that they're having to make.On the Pro side, it does remain strong. We do see some areas of weakness, again, in things like existing home resale, some of that's done by pros as well but we see strength in commercial strength and maintenance. And I think that's why it's holding up well. And that's not only a U.S. phenomenon, that's a phenomenon that we see in Europe as well."", 'Vincent J. Morales', 'TiO2.', 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Europe, I'm sorry, I missed that element. Yes, the TiO2 Europe, we're watching this process very closely. A couple of things. We have not dramatically shifted. We do buy a good bit from the Chinese TiO2 suppliers. They're an important part of our supply portfolio. And we're watching this process in Europe. We think, number one, it will be a very lengthy process. Number two, we have -- we're constantly working on the diversity of our supply base in TiO2 and the flexibility of that supply base, and we've made significant improvements there and where else we can use the various TiO2 from different parts of the world, including China.And again, we continue our longer-term initiative of reducing our dependence solely on TiO2 by removing it from our formulations without sacrificing performance. So those 3 things I would point to. Again, we're watching it very closely, and we'll adapt and I'm confident that the -- between the upstream supply being in a long situation and the diversification work that we've done, we'll do what we need to run our business."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""And just to expand on that diversification capability, we continue to add slurry capabilities around the world, which allows us to mix different TiO2 suppliers products and efficiency, we're at a multiyear, 6%, 7% of efficiency in TiO2 in the last 4 or 5 years. And we have very active projects continuing to become more efficient. Some of those could be recognizable in terms of our -- the breadth of our buy."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.', 'Frank Joseph Mitsch', ""Congrats on the new role, Jonathan. I wanted to come back to the volume questions. Tim, it sounded from your answer that flattish in Q1, basically, but you would expect as we progress through the year Q2, we'd probably see positive volumes. It sounded like that. I was wondering if you could clarify that. And Vince, when you mentioned Europe stabilizing, which is obviously a positive sign. But if I think about math of Europe deteriorating in the earlier parts of '23, if it's stabilizing at these low levels, it might suggest that '24, the net would be negative in terms of volume. So I was wondering if you could speak to that? And also any sort of comments you have with respect to -- I know you indicated that China, you anticipate positive volumes there, particularly with the weak comps. But what you're expecting in the Americas as well would be fantastic."", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Okay. Frank, I'll start. It's Tim. I think your interpretation of my volume comments are spot on. Positive volume for the year, flattish in Q1, and then you should see an uptick soon thereafter. So I do think that's spot on. I know you asked Vince to your question, I'm going to give a quick lead in on Europe. Despite the very benign 2023 volume environment in Europe, we had a record year of earnings in 2023 in Europe.So yes, it does impact the top line, but our team has really executed well and we had all-time record earnings and also, it's not all of our businesses in Europe, we have -- Arrow is very strong in Europe. Auto had a better-than-expected year in Europe. And frankly, we do expect that to continue. It's really mostly around the Deco market, particularly the Retail Deco market in Europe that saw negative volume. And PMC, PMC had a great European year with -- particularly driven by both Protective & Marine aftermarket. So I'd give that lead into Europe and hand it over to Vince."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Yes. When we say Europe stabilizing in Europe, Europe stabilizing in volumes for '24, we're looking at it quarter-over-quarter, Frank, and I know as you know, we're a very seasonal business there in our Deco, our architectural coatings business. So each quarter, we expect that stabilization respective to the last -- prior year quarter.So again, on a full year basis, we expect that to be flat, reflecting that year-over-year comp quarter-by-quarter. Again, our view of China is a bit different, I think, than what most markets are seeing. We always have to remind folks, we do not have a large architectural presence in China. One of the heaviest unfavorable items in China is the construction and housing market, very little exposure for us. Again, we're turning the corner on Industrial. Auto is growing.Our Refinish business is returning in China because of higher miles driven and Aerospace is starting to come back. So our mix of businesses in China helps us. And again, the fact that we don't have that architectural content, the architectural industry draws a lot of raw materials as well. So the fact that, that's down is supportive of our earnings in China."", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""And the last part of your question, what are we seeing in the U.S. relative to volume? We've got the PMC business, mostly on the P side, the Protective side, doing well in the U.S., driven a lot by energy spending and infrastructure traffic with infrastructure spending will be stronger this year, Refinish doing very well. And auto, the U.S. SAAR is holding up very well. I know inventories have ticked up a bit, but they're still only at about 40 days. So those would be on the -- and of course, Aero, we're selling everything we can make.So those would be on the positive side of the U.S. ledger. The negative side, again, we've said DIY multiple times, we do expect at least the first half of this year, to be soft there. The only upside there might be that we do believe destocking in that space is behind us. And then finally, I would say general industrial coatings driven by just industrial activity, and this could be all kinds of widgets that get painted. That's still a bit soft in the U.S. So that's a bit of a positive and negative ledger here at home, Frank."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyCorp.', 'Aleksey V. Yefremov', ""Can you just provide an update on your strategic efforts to broaden the product lines with Comex, where are you versus your goals? How -- what are your plans for '24 and maybe broader -- any update on other strategic organic growth initiatives that you talked about last year?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Yes, sure, Aleksey. So in PPG Comex in Mexico, we said in May, one of our key initiatives was to continue our robust performance and growth in the Deco space, and the team did that another record year, double-digit sales up on the year, but also to introduce other parts of our portfolio to that strong concessionaire network. And we've done that. Protective Coatings were up, let's call it, very high single digits. Adding again, adding that fourth letter, but traffic sales were up double digit. And I just returned, we just had all of our concessionaires together this past weekend and I was down there meeting with them, and they're very bullish on their ability to sell not only Deco, but these protective traffic, powder, light industrial coatings.So we're off and running. We just literally on -- I believe it was Monday of this week, introduced powder brands and refinish brands that are specific and dedicated and exclusive to the concessionaire network and that got a very good reception.Your other question on the initiatives that we kicked off last year as part of our enterprise growth strategy, I'd say I'm very pleased with the first year of execution of that enterprise growth strategy. As we said in the opening remarks, those initiatives, just in the first year, generated about $150 million of incremental sales. And some of those initiatives are longer-term initiatives than others and still in development.So between powder, films, the Mexico opportunity that we just talked about, EVs up 20% content per vehicle. They're all up and running and I'm very pleased with the progress that we have seen so far."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""And if I could just add a little broader commentary. We talked in May about being bullish on the Mexico economy. I think that has come through in space for us in the region. We continue to see reshoring of industrial activity into Mexico. We'll support that with our industrial -- we'll support that certainly with our Comex brand. In addition, one of the things we haven't -- Tim alluded to it on the opening comments, but we haven't talked about it in the Q&A, a second economy for us that's well outpacing most other regional economies is India. And we've got a good position in India as well, and that's supported by, I'll call it reshoring into India or shoring in India that is just starting."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas.', 'Laurent Guy Favre', ""In the presentation, in the list of watch out, you've mentioned the Red Sea situation. And Tim, I was wondering if you could talk about, I guess, how you're looking at the risks there in terms of ability to source impacts on costs. Have you seen anything on that side yet? And on the flip side, on the positive or potential positive, there's such a thing? Could it be a reason for a bit of a restocking along the chain in your customers? Or is it just not big enough of the deal right now?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Yes. Laurent, it's really not been anything near material to us to this point. First of all, from our direct products, Paint & Coatings don't do very well shipping around the world. We're mostly local for local. So minimal impact on our direct products. Our suppliers, we have -- our suppliers have plenty of capacity. There's plenty of inventory upstream of us. And our suppliers are seeing some delays but they're accounting for that in their production planning and in their logistics planning.So we're not expecting any impact to us there to the financial impact. We've seen a few minor, small surcharges being implemented, but frankly, to this point, pretty insignificant. So the piece that we're watching and the reason we listed it on that part of our slide, was we're not certain of the impact on customers particularly if you think about European auto OEMs where they've got sourcing from around the world. And if they're missing any critical parts, it may impact production scheduling, we have seen none of that so far.But that's really the piece we're watching more of our customer impact than on any internal impact. To your restocking, maybe I doubt that we'll see any significant inventory build of Paints & Coatings as a result of this. I think it will be more a movement of inventories upstream of us and how our suppliers deal with their own logistics planning. But again, the fact that they're pretty long right now, we're not expecting any issues."", 'Vincent J. Morales', 'And Laurent, just to put numbers to it. Typically, the average delay to do -- not going through the Red Sea is about 10 to 12 days. So certainly, plan -- we can plan for that on our raw material purchases.', 'Timothy M. Knavish', 'And Laurent, one more for me. We have nothing in the guide for the first quarter for this area.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup.', 'Patrick David Cunningham', ""Just on Auto Refinish. It seems like there's maybe some normalization there. So I guess my first question is what's causing lower collision claims in the U.S.? Is there anything structural you can point to like balance of total vehicles trending upwards? And how should we think about the outlook for Refinish for the full year by region?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Yes, I'll take this one. Refinish had a good year, a record quarter, and that was off of tough comps. Yes, claims still down in the U.S. Still down versus 2019. But we're able to achieve our results even at that level. And what I'll tell you is body shop activity is up and strong. And the only thing -- most of our body shop customers have backlogs, driven mostly by labor availability.So even though claims are down and we watch that closely, we're still performing. I would also add, largely because of our digital tools, we had a really good share-gain year and even the revenue that we get from those digital tools was up more than 100% year-over-year.So we feel good about that moving into this year. We've got a good order book as we sit here today. So yes, we are watching claims and mouse-driven. The only thing I can hypothesize is that the type of driving is maybe a bit different. Most downtowns and cities are still not as crowded as they used to be. We see more claims coming from suburbia than we used to. But overall, we feel positive about this business moving into the year. I'm confident in our best-in-class productivity, value proposition, we're winning shops. So I would say we expect to have another really strong year out of our Refinish business."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Yes. And then regionally, we expect the U.S. and Europe to hang around 0 plus or minus for the year. As we said earlier, we expect China to grow as we see kind of a reopening on a full year basis there. So that's the regional aspects. And just again, to hit on Tim's comment about our digital tools, these are tools we think are best-in-class. We have body shop productivity, focus on those tools. And those are a subscription model for us that didn't exist 3 or 4 years ago."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.', 'Michael Joseph Sison', 'I guess just one question, Tim, when you think about the -- achieving the 10% EPS growth at the midpoint, can you sort of break down sort of the key drivers? I know you talked about volume growth quite a bit. Is that low single digits, kind of half, a little bit more? Maybe how much is deflation and anything else that sort of gets you to that 10%?', 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Yes, Mike, I guess we'll both have a little bit of extra time this weekend. So we won't be glued to the TV screen based on last week's results. So wish you the best for that. We'll have some, it's a number of things. We'll certainly have positive price, as I mentioned earlier. We will have higher low single digits on volume, which will bring not only the benefit of margin dropping, but we will get better leverage out of our manufacturing assets by finally starting to get positive volume. We'll have manufacturing productivity that will be a piece of that. We do expect, even though it's a bit early to say what will happen on raws in the second half of the year, we do expect price net inflation to continue to be a good guy for us. And beyond that, I just answered some of the enterprise growth initiatives that we talked about.Those things will start to -- some of them have already started kicking in with that $150 million that I mentioned but we'll see continued momentum on those enterprise growth initiatives. Additionally, we got cash deployment. We haven't talked about that. We certainly didn't talk about it as we were rebuilding last year and paying down debt. But that will be another piece of the equation that wasn't there last year."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""Yes. And Mike, just I think it's important, a midpoint of 10%. Our operating results are going to be better than that. We do have some tax headwinds like most companies will have as some of the tax rates around the world move up. So we guided to a higher year-over-year tax rate. So operating results above 10%, offset -- modestly offset by this tax -- a higher tax rate."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.', 'Daniel Rizzo', ""This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Obviously, the focus is on China for a good reason, but I was just wondering what India in terms of sales versus China? And if there's any time in the coming years where India will be kind of competing in terms of importance versus China?"", 'John Bruno', 'Dan, this is John Bruno. I can take this. Most people know India has been one of the best economies in the world in 2023. We have a really good position there. We have a JV with Asia Paints. Our sales growth was circa 10% in 2023, and we expect continued good growth in 2024.', 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Yes. We -- our partnership with Asian Paints in India is fantastic and continues to perform very well. And across the same segments that were really strong in the rest of the world, which are doing well over there, automotive OEM, automotive refinish, industrial coatings, protective coatings. So that partnership is really world-class and helps us take our global technology advantage solutions to someone and partner with someone that's best-in-class within India. And so it's a really good story for us, not only in 2023, but going forward."", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""And again, going forward, as I alluded to earlier, again, there's a multitude of industries that are establishing or expanding their footprint in India, electronics, automotive, some aerospace. So again, a multitude of global industries that are expanding their footprint."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC.', 'Arun Shankar Viswanathan', ""Congrats on the strong results in '23. So just a question on the guidance. So if I look at the sales guidance, it looks like you are hoping to get to low single-digit organic growth in 2024. Just wanted to confirm that, that would be also including low single-digit volumes. And if so, how do you see that kind of playing out cadence-wise through the quarters, if you're guiding to flat volumes you want to -- you get to maybe 2% to 3% in Q2 and then mid-single digits in the back half?And similarly, on the earnings' growth bridge, your guidance kind of implies 1% growth EPS in Q1. So that would kind of require low double digits in Q2 through Q4, maybe something in the order of 13%. Is that the right way to think about it that really some of these onetime items in Q1 holds back your growth and you get more into the low single digits to mid-single digits on sales Q2 to Q3, Q4 and maybe low double digits to mid-teens Q2 through Q4 EPS growth?"", 'Vincent J. Morales', ""I think the math you have, Arun, is definitely accurate. We talked a lot on the call already about factors that affect Q1, some comparable factors last year, et cetera. Again, we're a seasonal business. For us, Q2 and Q3 are very large quarters for our Deco architectural businesses. They're very large, even larger for our traffic businesses. So again, we'll see a pickup in those businesses seasonally, but we're also expecting some different volume tenor than we had last year in those businesses.Tim went through, I think, a laundry list of items earlier that included the leverage on those higher volumes. We also would expect improved manufacturing that we've been working on, and we alluded to in our May CEO update that manufacturing should grow throughout the year.So again, I definitely agree that Q1 on a year-over-year basis, up modestly, but the back half of the year, we expect to grow in terms of a size."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg.', 'Aron Ceccarelli', 'I would like to go back to the topic of raw materials cost for a second. Your guidance has been improving throughout 2023. You were guiding down high single digit in Q3 to Q4. When I look at Q1 2023, your raw materials costs were still slightly inflationary. So why are you guiding just for mid-single-digit decline now? What has changed, if anything? Because when I look at gross margin, it expanded 450 basis points year-over-year in Q4. It looks to me this is accelerating. So what is driving this mid-single-digit guidance for Q1, please?', 'Vincent J. Morales', ""I think as we alluded to earlier, we do expect sequential improvement in the moderation of raw materials Q4 to Q1. And the mix of business for us as we build inventories, and we deplete inventories in Q4. We're building inventories in Q1. So that has a factor. But again, for the full year, we still expect moderation -- further moderation of raw materials for the full year 2024 versus 2023."", 'Operator', 'Our final question today comes from Jaideep Pandya with On Field Investment Research.', 'Jaideep Mukesh Pandya', ""Maybe it's not relevant, but given how low volumes are across the value chain, could you tell us like what is the spare capacity you have? I'm basically asking this question because a lot of investors are wondering if the margin growth left in the Coating sector beyond 2024 and given that it looks like in '25, '26, growth will come from volume. Just wondering what is the spare capacity you have in the system these days? That's my first question.The second question is really around raw materials. Do you expect to buy in sync with your volume growth this year? Or would you still destock? And therefore, if your volume growth is, let's say, up 2%, we shouldn't really expect raw material purchasing to be up 2%, it should be maybe 0. And the last question really is on Marine Protective. You alluded to firefighting protective. Now one of your competitors is very strong in that area. So have you launched new products and therefore gaining share from that competitor? Or is that the market is just doing very well?"", 'Timothy M. Knavish', ""Okay. Let me take those on, Jaideep. It's Tim. First of all, capacity, we got plenty of capacity. We have capacity -- volumes are still down significantly versus 2019. And we haven't taken capacity out since 2019. And frankly, I would say, our industry peers and certainly our suppliers, there's capacity. So yes, you're exactly right. You should expect that as volume comes up, certainly, we will get leverage from that volume, which will drop as margin improvement.Second question, raw materials and inventories. We do still have probably a few days higher DOI that we would like to have $100 million, $150 million more raw material inventory than we would like to have. So yes, we will be buying raw materials in Q1 as we get ready for the peak paint season and some of them are more seasonal businesses, but maybe a little bit less than what links directly to demand because of that excess that we're sitting on today.And finally, on Marine and Protective, the quick answer is yes. We have launched some new products, new technologies recently in the fire protection area that are quite strong and being well received by the market. For hydrocarbon fire protection is a product called PITT-CHAR NX, which has been very well received and on the cellulosic fire protection side, a product called Steelguard 651 which is also being very well received.So those new technologies are delivering share gain for us. But separate from fire protection, we've got really a fantastic product on the marine dry dock side that's very sustainable, very fuel efficient and drives -- it's really getting really good market receptivity and we've got a lot of share gains that will be -- we'll reap the benefits of those share gains in 2024 and beyond, and that's a product called Sigmaglide. So it is technology-driven in those spaces."", 'Operator', ""There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Jonathan Edwards."", 'Jonathan Edwards', 'Thank you, Elliot. Well done today.

And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial performance, and then I will move to our outlook."", 'In the fourth quarter, the PPG team delivered strong financial results, including record fourth-quarter sales of $4.4 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.53. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of delivering record sales as we continue to benefit from organic sales growth. Our fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was 25% higher year over year, driven by aggregated segment margin improvement of 260 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to be laser-focused on driving margin improvement. Our results reflect our continuing growth trends and strong execution in several of our leading and technology advantage businesses, which culminated in record fourth-quarter sales in the aerospace, automotive OEM, and automotive refinish businesses with strong performance in the protective and marine and PPG Mexico architectural coatings businesses.', 'Our year-over-year sales volume trend improved compared to recent quarters, decreasing less than 1% year over year. We continue to experience lower global industrial production along with soft U.S. and European architectural demand, especially for DIY-related products. Notable for us during the quarter was China, where despite a lethargic general economy, we achieved high single-digit percentage volume growth, reflecting our strong mix of businesses in the country.', 'In addition, we delivered flat year-over-year volumes in Europe as we see economic stabilization in the region, albeit at lower absolute demand levels. Our selling prices were about 2% higher with both segments delivering positive price led by the performance coatings segment. We expect total company selling prices to remain modestly positive in the first quarter of 2024 as new selling price increases have been implemented in several of our businesses. We also benefited from further normalization of our operations as we experienced stabilization of both upstream and downstream supply chains and order patterns.', 'From a supply perspective, the vast majority of our suppliers have more than sufficient capacity heading into 2024. We started the year laser-focused on margin recovery, and the fourth quarter marked our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating segment margin improvement. And as I mentioned, fourth-quarter aggregate segment operating margins increased 260 basis points year over year, and full year increased 310 basis points. We also achieved our second key priority for the year by delivering excellent cash generation of nearly $900 million during the fourth quarter, which was up over 300 million on a year-over-year basis, leading to record full-year cash generation of over $2.4 billion.', 'We significantly reduced working capital by a total of about $600 million on a sequential quarterly basis, and this includes the benefit from a partial reduction of our inventory levels. However, we still ended the year with higher inventory levels from a historical perspective, primarily in raw materials, and will continue to reduce inventory in the first half of 2024. The strong cash generated drove a reduction in net interest expense by about $20 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we repaid some high variable cost debt during the quarter. Additionally, we repurchased $100 million of stock in the fourth quarter, which essentially offset dilution.', ""Now, a few comments on the full year 2023. As we communicated at the beginning of 2023, my priorities included margin recovery, strong cash generation, and further strengthening of our capabilities to support our customers' productivity and sustainability needs, which will result in higher PPG organic growth. And coming into 2023, we had a high degree of conviction that our global business portfolio would prove resilient while anticipating a challenging economic environment, and these clearly played out during the year. For the full year, I'm proud of our team's execution against our strategic objectives as it resulted in delivery of record sales, record adjusted EPS, and record operating cash flow."", 'Our sales performance was led by continued selling price execution to offset significant multiyear cost inflation. Our year-over-year earnings growth was driven by these improved selling prices coupled with moderating input costs and cost structure reductions stemming from our cost management and restructuring initiatives. This resulted in improved margins in both segments. Our businesses delivered innovative and value-added products and solutions to our customers, and this enabled several of our businesses to set all-time annual sales records, including our aerospace, auto OEM, automotive refinish, architectural Mexico, and the protective and marine coatings businesses.', 'Our enterprise growth initiatives delivered about $150 million of incremental sales in the first year, including strong growth from selling our innovative products for electric vehicles as well as our share gains in powder coatings. In automotive refinish, customer adoption of our industry-leading digital tools accelerated, yielding nearly 2,000 net bodyshop wins. These digital tools include our LINQ services and Moonwalk mixing machines, both of which are best-in-class and are focused on improving bodyshop productivity. In Mexico, we further advanced cross-selling of our valued products, including protective coatings and certain light industrial coatings through the best-in-class distribution network of nearly 5,200 concessionaire locations.', 'Finally, our strong focus on the customer drove share gains across several businesses including expansion of our architectural coatings products at Walmart. Strategically, we conducted an ongoing review of both our product and business portfolios leading to the divestiture of several noncore assets including our European and Australian traffic solutions businesses, along with the recently announced strategic alternatives review of the silicas product business. In a variety of cases, we also simplified and improved our product offering, allowing us to reduce complexity and drive down working capital. Finally, these actions plus strong balance sheet management resulted in record full-year 2023 cash generation of 2.4 billion.', ""So, overall, we achieved excellent financial results in 2023 and are anticipating improving from this higher base in 2024. We remain confident that we will deliver positive sales volume in 2024, including benefits from China, India, and Mexico. We've delivered share gains in several businesses, including auto refinish, packaging, and the protective and marine coatings businesses. We will also execute on our more than $250 million order backlog in aerospace, drive further growth in our well-positioned businesses in Mexico, and further expand the benefits of our key growth initiatives, including powder coatings, electric vehicle products, and digital solutions."", ""We will drive further improvement of our operating margins aided by the sales volume growth leverage and our initiatives that drive manufacturing productivity following several years of supply chain and other disruptions. Lastly, we entered 2024 with a strong balance sheet, which provides us with the flexibility for further shareholder value creation going forward, including funding organic growth initiatives, appropriate acquisitions, debt repayment, and share repurchases. Now, I'll comment on our first-quarter outlook. We expect to deliver sequential adjusted EPS growth from $1.53 per share in Q4 2023 to a range of $1.80 to $1.87 per share in Q1 of 2024, an increase of 20% at the midpoint of the range."", 'We anticipate global industrial production to remain soft, and our year-over-year sales volume performance will be unfavorably impacted by the approximate $40 million nonrecurring Walmart customer load-in that occurred in the first quarter of 2023. Also, the timing of the Easter holiday will shift some sales into the second quarter. Despite these difficult year-over-year comparison items, we expect our first-quarter sales volume will be flat overall aided by positive sales volume growth in our aerospace, protective and marine, and packaging coatings businesses. We project solid growth in our auto OEM business in Asia Pacific, where we expect to drive solid volume growth in China, led by our strong positioning with the electric vehicle OEM producers.', 'Additionally, we expect to deliver organic sales growth through our best-in-class Mexico distribution platform. We anticipate overall company selling prices to remain positive as some modest declines in our industrial reporting segment related to a small portion of customer-based index contracts will be more than offset by targeted selling price increases in our performance coatings segment. First-quarter comparisons also include declines in certain transitory European and energy-related pricing indices that were put in place during the period of extremely high energy prices in the region. These particular price declines are offset by lower purchased energy costs for our facility.', 'The net selling price increases, along with various productivity initiatives, will serve to offset somewhat higher expected wage inflation in 2024, especially in emerging regions. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply remains ample, and we will continue to realize benefits from moderating input costs including further recognition of savings stemming from working down our higher inventories as we progress through 2024. We will diligently manage our costs and expect to deliver manufacturing and productivity gains supported by a more stable supply chain and customer order patterns. We anticipate more moderate year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter associated with some of the transitory items I mentioned earlier.', 'However, we are confident that we will deliver our commitment for full-year earnings growth of around 10% at our forecast guidance midpoint. Finally, I want to thank our more than 50,000 employees for making it happen by delivering excellent 2023 financial results and positioning the company for growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond for the benefit of all stakeholders. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks.', 'And now, would you please open the line for questions.', '', 'Operator', ""Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. First question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open."", 'Please go ahead.', 'Dave Begleiter -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good morning. Tim and Vince, do you expect total company pricing to be up in '24? I presume that if it is, it's a positive performance than industrial. Within performance, are you seeing pressure from big box retailers to lower your paint prices?"", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, good morning, Dave. Thanks for the question. We will have positive company price for full year 2024. Again, to your point, largely from performance coatings and a more targeted beyond that.', ""As far as big box pricing, most of the big box pricing is contractual, and so, I wouldn't say that you'll see a significant movement in that pricing throughout the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'John McNulty -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe a little bit more color on the raw material front. Can you speak to -- relative to what you reported in the fourth quarter, how much lower are raw materials that you're buying right now? Because it does look like things are held up a little bit because of FIFO and also some of your destocking."", 'Is it just the mid single-digit dip that you guided to for 1Q, or is there more to it than that? And how should we be thinking about that?', 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah, John. This is Vince. If you look throughout all of last year, we continued to accrue larger benefits from the moderation of raw materials. We will remind everybody, raw material costs are still higher on a multiyear basis by a significant amount.', ""As Tim mentioned, most of our suppliers have more than ample capacity, and it's certainly a focus for them to pick up more volume. We expect some incrementally better invoice -- invoice benefits from raw materials, and then that will eventually flow through our P&L as we go through the year. But year over year, we expect some incrementally beneficial invoice pricing."", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. And I would just add -- this is Tim, John. Thanks for the question. I would just add that fundamentally, upstream of us, it's still a pretty long environment."", ""No issues on our end from availability, and I think that's a good indicator for us as we move through the year as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Ghansham Panjabi -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Tim, I want to go back to the question that was asked earlier about pricing. As you kind of zoom out a bit, price for PPG as a whole has been up over 20% since 2021, and a lot of that is just enormity of the raw material cycle and so on and so forth, which seems to have changed significantly.', ""Your confidence on pricing holding or being up in 2024 and maybe even beyond that, is that based partly on the mix change in the portfolio with aerospace and so on and so forth? Or is there something unique about the industry structure now that's going to allow you to hold on to the enormity of these price increases, but raw materials doing what they're doing."", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Hey, good morning, Ghansham. It's not a mix issue for us, Ghansham. It's more -- first of all, I'm very pleased with how we've continued to hold price, even just closing out fourth quarter with another 2% increment."", ""Again, we'll be positive in Q1, the confidence level is more because of a couple of things. One, to Vince's point earlier, raws are still quite elevated. We're talking about coming off of extremely high peaks. And so -- but they're still quite elevated from, say, 2019."", ""So, we don't see what I would characterize as massive deflation by any means. And the confidence level as we move through the year, I'll talk performance coatings. We -- as you know well, we get price almost irrespective there of the raw material environment because of the unique value proposition that we deliver in performance where we're such a small part of the cost structure of our customers from a pure paint standpoint, but the value add outside of the can that we deliver is such a big significant impact on their cost structure. So, that's a very different model there."", ""And on industrial side, where maybe it is more proportionate to raw material increases or decreases, we just don't see the long supply dynamic upstream of us changing dramatically as we move through the year. When you think about, for example, China, just not having a V-shaped rebound. And China is a big consumer of raws. So, we expect a more moderate environment as we move through 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Duffy Fischer -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Good morning, guys. Two questions. First is cash flow as a percent of EBITDA. If you hit the midpoint of your guide this year, EBITDA should be up about 250 million.', ""Should we expect a commensurate move in cash flow would be one? And then two, in the auto OE business, you guided to down low single digits coming into Q4. You did mid single digits up, again, guiding down in Q1, is that just conservatism? Because when you look at the auto numbers, it seems like auto OE should be better than that unless there's some pricing in there. So, can you just talk about what you're seeing in auto OE for Q1 price versus volume?"", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Hey, Duffy. This is Tim. I'll do the auto one."", ""I'll let Vince do the cash versus EBITDA one. Auto had a really good year for us last year, and we are well positioned for what we view as a multiyear recovery. So, I personally continue to be bullish on auto as we look into the full year 2024. When you look at our Q1, and we went from up mid single digits in Q4, and we're projecting low single digits down in Q1."", ""A lot of that, if you go back to last year, we were a strong double digit up in Q1 of 2023. And also, yes, there is some -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have some of our index pricing rolling back, and that has some impact. But I would not -- personally, I'm not overconcerned about auto volumes as we move through the year. I think total builds were 89-point-something last year."", 'I believe there is some incremental upside to that as we move through 2024. Our share position is good. Our China auto position is really good. And as you know, out of the 90 million new builds, about 30 million will come out of China.', ""So, overall, feeling good about auto. There's a little bit of a year-over-year comp soft point and a little bit of index pricing rolling off in Q1."", 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', ""Just to add, we talked several times, Duffy, on auto. Acceleration in China helps us from an EV perspective as well. So, we have more content on any traditional EV than we do on ICE. So, that's a buffer for us in PPG in particular."", ""To your cash flow question, yes, I think the short answer is typically, EBITDA would certainly serve as a proxy for cash flow, plus or minus. We have the last couple of years -- expanded answer is we have the last couple of years -- had working capital movement that has either helped or hurt the cash flow on a transitory basis. We do have, as Tim alluded to in his opening comments, probably a couple of hundred million dollars of excess raw materials in inventory. We're going to work that down in 2024."", ""So, that will have a cash flow implication for us in a positive manner. But I think generally, what you're saying, EBITDA and cash flow should be -- the movement should be consistent."", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. And, Duffy, this is Tim. I'm going to come back with one additional. Vince mentioned the EV situation."", ""And we all see the headlines on -- on EVs, but that's largely U.S. and Europe right now. And as you know, two-thirds of the world's EVs are made in China. And that content number, if you look at the average PPG content across the EV space for 2023, was up by 20%."", 'So, our content per EV built was up by 20% in 2023. So, that bodes well for us as well.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Steve Byrne -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Yes. Thank you. Tim, you've been involved in this partnership with Home Depot for a long time. I'm curious to hear your view whether it's going better or worse than what you had expected? And any potential forward inflection in that relationship in 2024? And if you don't mind, can you just comment on SG&A for 2024? It seemed to really jump in the fourth quarter."", 'Were there some unusuals in there like with your strategic actions? Any comments on that? How should we forecast that going forward?', 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Hey, good morning, Steve. Yeah. There was -- the quick answer on your second question is there were some unusuals, and Vince will take that.', ""But your first one, the Home Depot relationship and progress on the Pro program is going as expected. Quite frankly, the challenge that we have is that as it's growing off relatively small denominator, as you know, it's still being offset by the challenges on the DIY side. DIY is still the Home Depot and the Glynn brand and Olympic brands are still a critical part of our DIY omnichannel strategy going forward. And unfortunately, the negatives there from a volume standpoint are offsetting the good progress that we have on our pro omnichannel between the Home Depot and our own network."", ""If I look at -- just to give some perspective, so Q4, despite the challenges out there, we were up low single digits on our pro omnichannel. And our sell out with the Home Depot was one of our better quarters yet. So, we're making progress there. But our DIY omnichannel, which includes not only what we do with the Home Depot, but also our big partner in the Midwest, our DIY, remain down."", ""So, that's the issue there, but the momentum continues to grow. It's -- as I've said many times, we are building a business model for the future that's brick-and-mortar light. And it's a marathon, not a sprint. And we continue to tick off miles on the marathon."", 'So, good progress.', 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, Steve. On the overhead, I'm going to just look at the whole year because there's always movement between quarters within a year. But on a full-year basis, our overhead was up about $380 million. About a third of that is directly correlated to the increase in sales, whether it be volume, price, or FX."", 'So, on a percentage basis, if you just do the percents comparison, you get about a third of that directly related to our sales movement. Another third of that on a year-over-year basis, and then Tim alluded to this in his opening remarks, we did have a higher shareholder-based and performance-based compensation. And reminder that in the prior year, we had much lower compensation. So, kind of a doubling effect on a year-over-year basis.', 'And the final third, roughly 100 million or so of inflation. And the remainder of that would be growth initiatives for some of the key programs we won throughout the year and including our Comex growth, etc.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'John Roberts -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', ""Good morning. Is your China strength primarily China for China? Or is it the strong exports of cars that we're seeing out of China?"", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Hey, John. It's both. But I mean the vast majority of the vehicles that we paint in China stay in China."", 'The exciting part on the export side is the largest producer of EVs now in the world, a Chinese producer, is beginning to export. So, that will just be incremental upside, but the vast majority of the cars that we paint in China stay in China.', 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. And, John, I think for our book of business, again, 2023, especially at the beginning part of 2023, it was a tougher year. We're starting to see industrial and some of our other businesses kind of turned the corner in the fourth quarter and now heading into 2024."", 'John Bruno -- Vice President, Finance', 'One more, John, from John Bruno. Outside of auto OEM, a very high percentage of the coatings we sell in China are for products that stay in China.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Josh Spector -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Yes, hi. Thanks. So, I wanted to follow up on industrial pricing. So, when you're talking about down modestly for the first quarter year on year, maybe it's 50, 100 basis points, I guess, in the frame of that, does that -- is it stabilized at that level through the year, or do you expect it to decline? So, kind of, separating the energy give back from maybe some of the index pricing."", 'And I guess when you look at this longer term then, what does this mean for margin potential for the industrial segment? Are we looking at more normal incrementals from here to price raw still play into that? Or what are the factors that maybe move the margins up from the current level beyond this year? Thanks.', 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Josh. Let me start, and I'll let Tim add some color here. But we did -- I just want to remind people -- and again, we talked about this in opening comments in our prepared remarks we released last evening. Just a reminder, Q1 last year in Europe, there was exceedingly high."", ""Energy costs, natural gas costs were $30 to $40 per MMBtu depending on the day. Most companies, PPG included invoked surcharges to pass those through. That, we're lapping that in Q1 of this year. That is a third to half of our price decline in the first quarter in the industrial coatings segment."", 'And the remainder is organic based on the indices that Tim was talking about. Tim you have some color here?', 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I think the question about margin expansion beyond what Vince described in pricing is the volume leverage will be significant on the industrial segment because that's the segment that really got hit the hardest during COVID and COVID recovery. And so, we've still got significant margin upside driven by volume leverage. The other side, if you go back to our CEO day in May in New York, we pointed to about $150 million to $200 million of manufacturing productivity gains that we had line of sight to in the coming years, really, not just to get back to where we were pre-COVID, but also as we modernize, automate, digitize our operations."", 'So, those will really be the two levers that get us to the next horizon on margin largely across the industrial segment but somewhat also in the performance coatings side.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with VRP. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Kevin McCarthy -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst', ""Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Tim, would you elaborate on your volume outlook that's embedded in your '24 guide? Would you expect volumes to be flat or up a little bit? Part of the reason I ask is we've seen many chemical companies suffer from volumes that are trending well-below real GDP. And so, as you look across your portfolio and survey and forecast, do you think we'll see convergence in 2024? Or are there pockets of residual destocking or other headwinds that might make that more ambitious?"", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. Hi, Kevin. So, first of all, we're going to have positive volume in 2024 for the year. I would -- our sales, we said, are going to be up low single digits."", ""We might have to start putting a fourth letter there because I think the -- I'm sorry, the volume will be a little higher on the low single-digit side, and the price will be a little lower on the low single-digit side. But we have volume momentum for really five quarters now, minus three, minus two, a little lighter, minus two, our fourth quarter. We rounded it up to minus one. It was actually less than minus one."", ""We're looking at a zero for Q1. And that includes the impact of the Walmart load-in. It includes the shift from -- of Easter from one quarter to the next. So, we have momentum on volume, some of it just because of the diversity of our portfolio and where we participate, but some of it because of the growth initiatives that we've worked on throughout 2023, where we've picked up share that will start to kick in this year."", ""I think about our packaging coatings business, our industrial coatings business, our refinish coatings business. So, it's really the positivity on volume is one even though they've had negative numbers in front of them for much of 2023, we do have volume momentum. We see it flipping in early 2024. And it's a combination of strength of our portfolio positioning and execution on our growth initiatives."", 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', ""And just a couple of other items of note, Kevin, we expect Europe to stabilize, which really reflects a lack of a destock. We experienced a destocking, especially in the first half of 2023, and that's -- we feel that's won its course. So, stabilization in Europe, which has been a negative for us. And again, China on the 2023, first-half basis was light."", 'So, again, as that normalizes the pandemic effect of that hopefully is behind us, and as that normalizes, provides us with some uplift. And we are -- we do have this backlog that Tim alluded to in the opening remarks in aerospace. So, we continue to produce more products at our manufacturing sites, and that we expect that to continue to grow throughout the year to work down that backlog, which is more than a half a year backlog for us.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Mike Leithead -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask around cash deployment.', ""Your net leverage ended the year toward the lower end of where it's historically been. I guess, three very brief questions. One, can you just remind us roughly what target leverage you intend to maintain? Two, how does the M&A market look today, say, relative to returning more cash to shareholders this year? And then third, I think you're guiding to 15 million of interest in 1Q, but about 95 million for the year. So, why does that step up so much? I'm assuming that takes into consideration of more cash deployment."", 'Could you just help clarify that? Thank you.', 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. Hi. Mike, it's Tim. I'll start."", ""Target, we don't write a target in pen because it changes with time, depending on where we are in the execution of our strategy. We're doing some portfolio things. You've seen some announcements in that regard. And where we are on our strength of our balance sheet, very strong right now, but it would be different as the environment changes."", ""M&A, it has -- it was a little quiet there for some time. We're seeing some things come across our desk now. Nothing huge in the pipeline, but we're seeing some assets come across, and we're evaluating those. Overall, on the strength of the balance sheet and deployment, consistent with what I said throughout last year, number one, we're going to focus on continuing to generate strong cash."", ""That gives us a great deal of flexibility. I'm very proud of what the team did in 2023. Just to be very clear, we will not let cash sit on the balance sheet. We'll do what we need to do from dividends."", ""We've got some good organic growth investments that we'll invest in. Love to do some shareholder value accretion -- accretive acquisitions. And if that doesn't come along, then we'll return cash by buying shares. We did some in Q4 for the first time in a long time."", ""And if we've got excess cash sitting on the balance sheet, you can be assured that that's what we'll do. Now, Q1, we're sitting with a lot of cash right now, but we typically consume significant cash in Q1. And so, we'll be a little cautious here in Q1 so that we don't get back into paying high interest cost debt, which we just got out of. But beyond that, you should expect us to not let the cash sit there."", 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Let me just add. This is Vince. I just want to reemphasize a key comment Tim said.', ""We prefer a strong balance sheet due to the optionality it gives us on many fronts. We feel where we are today, we don't need to let cash grow. We will consume cash through April. That's our traditional seasonality of our businesses."", ""So, the 1.5 billion that sits on the balance sheet, we will consume them through April. That allows us to not enter the debt markets as significantly as we normally would for commercial paper. At this time of the year, we're typically adding commercial paper throughout -- from now through the end of April. So, that's why our interest cost in Q1 will be lower because we're going to use the cash on hand to fund that seasonal inventory build."", ""That cash will then -- what we typically generate strong cash in the back half of the year, which is we'll deplete our interest income. And then, as we generate that strong cash in the back half of the year, we'll look at other uses."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.

And then finally, in your accounts payable in your accrued liabilities line, your year-over-year increase that is a benefit was about 380 million.', ""And sequentially, maybe it was 250. Now, you guys don't disaggregate accounts payable from accrued liabilities. Can you explain what's going on there and that many, many companies had much lower accounts payable this year, and it seems to have really worked in the other direction for you?"", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hi, Jeff. It's Tim. I'll take titanium dioxide question. And, Vince, you can take the more finance-related questions there."", ""TiO2, we see very good availability. We see a long supply chain upstream of us, it's still quite long. And so, we're seeing some modestly lower pricing on TiO2 than what we would have seen last year. It's not down as much as some other parts of our basket, but it's definitely down from where we were last year, Jeff."", ""And on TiO2, in addition to pricing, I do have to mention that a key part of our strategy is to continue the research work that we do to reduce our titanium dioxide content in our formulas every year without sacrificing any performance. And our team has done a great job there. We're down about 1% per formula over the last several years, and we achieved that again in 2023."", 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Jeff. On the balance sheet questions, I'm not going to be able to calculate the FIFO, LIFO impact on the fly here. We can just a reminder everybody, we're at 75% or so. FIFO, the difference between, again, the invoice cost and what we're realizing on the income statement for raw material moderation, that is tens of millions of dollars, if we move that to a FIFO."", ""I can't calculate it precisely. As it relates to payables, for us, we had a couple of items in the fourth quarter. Our tax provisioning is about $100 million higher. We ended the year on a weekend, two-day weekend."", ""So, our accounts payable is higher because of that. There's natural FX in that number on a year-over-year basis. And we had, as you saw, an environmental special for about $30 million where we accrued $30 million for future environmental spending.

In the first quarter, I get the timing shift of Easter, but February also had an extra day this year. So, does that not offset the Easter impact? And then also on TiO2, how much Chinese TiO2 are you guys buying these days? And how much of it is in Europe? And have you changed any purchasing patterns as a function of the EU's investigation to Chinese imports? And then lastly, the pro architectural business has been holding up an awful lot better than the DIY business, just in a similar fortunately, far enough away from COVID now that I think we should be able to have a conversation about what's driving the DIY weakness other than just a pull forward of volumes."", ""And what's keeping the pro business so high or so strong because it just seems like there's a disconnect between sort of pro demand being there, but DIY being so weak? So, if you could help with those three things, I'd appreciate it."", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""OK, Vincent. This is Tim. On the Q1, yes, I'd say correct. There is an extra day in February."", ""I think the negativity of Easter impacts that more significantly in one day because particularly some parts of the world, Europe, vacations before, some vacations after other parts of the world. We do have -- Easter time is typically a good month for us in Mexico. And so, it's more significant than the one day. But you are correct."", ""Also on Q1 though, we have -- in addition to the Easter impact, you do have that customer load-in that we mentioned and the energy pricing issue that Vince mentioned earlier. On the pro DIY, first of all, DIY remains down. And yes, some of it, I don't know if we could put a time stamp exactly on it, but some of it, you could call it COVID -- a post-COVID hangover as people did a lot of pull forward. I think now it's more general inflation and general consumer spending and confidence on remodeling at home."", ""And some of it is existing home resale too, where sellers -- DIY sellers will paint their house, DIY buyers will paint their house. So, I do think some of it is related to what's happening with existing home sales as well. But I do think it's some combination of that and just overall inflation and how it's hitting the average consumer's pocket book and the decisions that they're having to, make. On the pro side, does remain strong."", ""We do see some areas of weakness, again, in things like existing home resale, some of that's done by pros as well. But we see strength in commercial strength and maintenance. And I think that's why it's holding up well.

I'm sorry, I missed that element. Yeah, the TiO2 Europe, we're watching this process very closely. A couple of things."", ""We have not dramatically shifted. We do buy a good bit from the Chinese TiO2 suppliers. They're an important part of our supply portfolio, and we're watching this process in Europe. We think, number one, it will be a very lengthy process."", ""Number two, we have -- we're constantly working on the diversity of our supply base in TiO2 and the flexibility of that supply base. And we've made significant improvements there and where else we can use the various TiO2 from different parts of the world, including China. And again, we continue our longer-term initiative of reducing our dependence solely on TiO2 by removing it from our formulations without sacrificing performance. So, those three things I would point to."", ""Again, we're watching it very closely. And we'll adapt.

Tim, it sounded from your answer that flattish in Q1, basically, but you would expect as we progress through the year, Q2, we'd probably see positive volumes. It sounded like that."", ""I was wondering if you could clarify that. And, Vince, when you mentioned Europe stabilizing, which is obviously a positive sign, but if I think about math of Europe deteriorating in the earlier parts of '23, if it's stabilizing at these low levels, it might suggest that '24, the net would be negative in terms of volume. So, I was wondering if you could speak to that. And also any sort of comments you have with respect to -- I know you indicated that China, you anticipate positive volumes there, particularly with the weak comps."", ""But what you're expecting in the Americas as well would be fantastic."", 'Tim Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""OK. Hey, Frank, I'll start. It's Tim. I think your interpretation of my volume comments are spot on."", ""Positive -- positive volume for the year, flat-ish in Q1, and then you should see an up-tick soon thereafter. So, I do think that's spot on. I know you asked Vince your question. I'm going to give a quick lead in on Europe."", ""Despite the very benign 2023 volume environment in Europe, we had a record year of earnings in 2023 in Europe.

We have -- aero is very strong in Europe."", ""Auto had a better-than-expected year in Europe. And frankly, we do expect that to continue. It's really mostly around the deco the deco market, particularly the retail deco market in Europe that saw a negative volume. And PMC, PMC had a great European year with -- particularly driven by both protective and marine aftermarket."", ""So, I'd give that lead into Europe and hand it over to Vince."", 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. When we say Europe stabilizing in Europe, Europe stabilizing in volumes for 2024, we're looking at it quarter over quarter, Frank, and I know as you know, we're a very seasonal business there in our deco, our architectural coatings business. So, each quarter, we expect that stabilization respective to the last prior-year quarter. So, again, on a full-year basis, we expect that to be flat, reflecting that year-over-year comp quarter by quarter."", ""Again, our view of China is a bit different, I think, than what most markets are seeing. We always have to remind folks, we do not have a large architectural presence in China. One of the heaviest unfavorable items in China is the construction and housing market, very little exposure for us. Again, we're turning the corner on industrial."", 'Auto is growing. Our refinish business is returning in China because of higher miles driven. And aerospace is starting to come back.

So, in PPG Comex in Mexico, we said in May, one of our key initiatives was to continue our robust performance and growth in the deco space. And the team did that, another record year, double-digit sales up on the year, but also to introduce other parts of our portfolio to that strong concessionaire network. And we've done that."", ""Protective coatings were up, let's call it, very high single-digits. Adding again adding that fourth letter, but traffic sales were up double digit. And I'd just return, we just had all of our concessionaires together this past weekend and I was down there meeting with them, and they're very bullish on their ability to sell not only deco but these protective traffic, powder, light industrial coatings. So, we're off and running."", ""We just literally on, I believe it was Monday of this week, introduced powder brands and refinish brands that are specific and dedicated and exclusive to the concessionaire network. And that got a very good reception. Your other question on the initiatives that we kicked off last year as part of our enterprise growth strategy, I'd say, I am very pleased with the first year of execution of that enterprise growth strategy. As we said in the opening remarks, those initiatives, just in the first year, generated about $150 million of incremental sales."", ""And some of those initiatives are longer-term initiatives than others and still in development.

We've seen a few minor, small surcharges being implemented, but frankly, to this point, pretty insignificant. So, the piece that we're watching and the reason we listed it on that part of our slide was we're not certain of the impact on customers particularly if you think about European auto OEMs, where they've got sourcing from around the world. And if they're missing any critical parts, it may impact production scheduling."", ""We have seen none of that so far. That's really the piece we're watching more of a customer impact than on any internal impact. To your restocking, maybe -- I doubt that we'll see any significant inventory build of paints and coatings as a result of this.

And the only thing -- most of our bodyshop customers have backlogs, driven mostly by labor availability. So, even though claims are down and we watch that closely, we're still performing. I would also add, largely because of our digital tools, we had a really good share gain year, and even the revenue that we get from those digital tools was up more than 100% year over year."", ""So, we feel good about that moving into this year. We've got a good order book as we sit here today. So, yes, we are watching claims and mouse driven.

We'll certainly have positive price, as I mentioned earlier. We will have higher low single digits on volume, which will bring not only the benefit of margin dropping, but we will get better leverage out of our manufacturing assets by finally starting to get positive volume."", ""We'll have a manufacturing productivity that will be a piece of that. We do expect -- even though it's a bit early to say what will happen on raws in the second half of the year, we do expect price net inflation to continue to be a good guide for us.

Just wanted to confirm that that would be also including low single-digit volumes. And if so, how do you see that kind of playing out cadence-wise through the quarters if you're guiding to flat volumes, you get to maybe 2% to 3% in Q2 and then mid single digits in the back half. And similarly, on the earnings growth bridge, your guidance kind of implies 1% growth EPS in Q1."", 'So, that would require low double digits in Q2 through Q4, maybe something in the order of 13%. Is that the right way to think about it that really some of these one-time items in Q1 holds back your growth and you get more into the low single digits to mid single digits on sales to Q2 to Q3, Q4 and maybe low double digits to mid teens Q2 through Q4 on EPS growth? Thanks.', 'Vince Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer', ""I think the math you have, Arun, is definitely accurate.

They're very large, even larger for our traffic businesses."", ""So, again, we'll see a pickup in those businesses seasonally, but we're also expecting some different volume tenor than we had last year in those businesses. Tim went through, I think, a laundry list of items earlier that included the leverage on those higher volumes. We also would expect improved manufacturing that we've been working on, and we alluded to in our May CEO update that manufacturing should grow throughout the year.

So, why are you guiding just for mid single-digit decline now? What has changed, if anything? Because when I look at gross margin, it expanded 450 basis points year over year in Q4.

Second question, raw materials and inventories."", ""We do still have probably a few days higher DOI that we would like to have, $100 million, $150 million more raw material inventory than we would like to have. So, yes, we will be buying raw materials in Q1 as we get ready for the peak paint season and some of them are more seasonal businesses, but maybe a little bit less than what links directly to demand because of that excess that we're sitting on today.

In my prepared remarks, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, highlight a number of achievements and share our thoughts on the outlook for 2024 and our financial ambitions. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results, and we'll open the line for your questions. Let's begin. The fourth quarter was an impressive conclusion to the year's financial results. We grew revenue both sequentially and year-on-year, and we achieved cycle-high margins and cash flows during the quarter. Our strong performance was fueled by the international and offshore markets and was supported by robust sales in digital and integration of the acquired Aker subsea business. Throughout the year, we witnessed continued growth in international and offshore markets, where customers are focused on enhanced production and capacity additions. We've also seen further investments in digital technologies for planning and operational efficiencies. This is driving growth today and presenting opportunities into the future. The international shift in investment has accelerated during the year with fourth quarter revenue growth driven by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa while we continue to benefit from long-cycle developments, capacity expansions and exploration and appraisal activities. Specific to offshore, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter as we grew our legacy portfolio and harnessed a strong performance from our OneSubsea joint venture. On this note, I would like to extend my thanks to the entire Aker subsea team, who have joined us 3 months ago and have already contributed very well to our strong year-end results. Exiting the year, our international revenue and margins reached new cycle highs, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth on the international front. And we delivered exceptional free cash flow of $2.3 billion in the quarter. Next, let me reflect on our accomplishments for the full year. We fulfilled our full year financial ambitions, growing revenue by 18%, surpassing our revenue growth target for the year and achieving adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Additionally, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, our highest since 2015. In the Core, across Production Systems, Reservoir Performance and Well Construction, we grew revenue by more than 20% and expanded pretax operating margins by almost 300 basis points. This was driven by strong activity internationally and offshore, new technology deployments and strong product sales. Notably, we achieved our highest-ever revenue in the Middle East, led by impressive growth in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and East Mediterranean. Offshore also continued its positive momentum, led by remarkable growth in Brazil and Angola and very solid increases in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Guyana and Norway. This was supported by the contribution from the acquired Aker subsea business, which enabled us to expand in certain markets, mainly in Norway and Australia. Additionally, our fit-for-basin business model continued to deliver differentiated value in North America, resulting in revenue growth outperforming the rig count. In digital, we continue to witness the adoption of our digital workflow and data/AI platform as customers work to enhance efficiency and returns by integrating our connected and autonomous drilling, data and AI solutions. We now have more than 6,000 DELFI users and have generated 125 million compute hours, both representing more than 40% growth year-on-year. As a result, we achieved full year digital revenue of more than $2 billion with our new technology platforms comprised of cloud, edge and AI growing at a CAGR of 60% since 2021. In new energy, we forged new partnerships and made new investments in capture technology for carbon capture and storage. We are seeing very positive momentum in this space. And we are also -- we are actively participating in more than $400 million of CCS tenders globally. Additionally, in geothermal and geo-energy, we are partnering with government agencies in the Middle East on lower carbon electricity and in Europe on zero-carbon heating and cooling solutions. As we advanced our three engines of growth, we also continue to deliver for our customers and stakeholders by achieving our lowest recordable injury rate and highest level of operational reliability on record. This is also reflected in industry surveys, where we are growing customer satisfaction through performance and value creation. Finally, we reduced our emission intensity across Scope 1, 2 and 3 on the path to achieving our 2025 emissions reduction commitment. Moving forward, we are well positioned to capture further growth. And I look forward to building on this strong success in the year ahead. I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering these impressive results. Turning to the macro. The characteristics of breadth, resilience and durability that have defined this cycle remain fully in place. This continues to be supported by the imperative of energy security to meet rising global demand, confirming our belief in the longevity of the cycle. After a year of demand growth in 2023, we anticipate further growth in 2024 that will continue to support the ongoing multiyear investment cycle. In international markets, growth momentum is set to continue with more than 2/3 of total investment taking place in the Middle East, offshore and gas resource plays. In the Middle East, growth will be led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which continue to commit significant investments to increase production capacity in both oil and unconventional gas, followed by Iraq and Kuwait. Meanwhile, in Asia, countries such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia and India are leading new gas exploration and development. And across other international basins, we anticipate strong activity led by Brazil and followed by West Africa and Australia. Looking across this wide baseload of activity, a significant portion is taking place offshore, where capital expenditures will continue their growth momentum in 2024. As a result, the rig count will continue to rise, mainly in the Middle East and Asia, responding to a strong FID pipeline in both shallow and deepwater. All in all, we see the potential for more than $100 billion in global offshore FIDs in both 2024 and 2025, underscoring the enduring strength of the offshore markets and supporting a very favorable subsea outlook for years to come. In this context, although geopolitical tensions persist in several regions, we do not expect any significant impact to activity in 2024, absent further escalation. Additionally, although we have witnessed short-term commodity price fluctuate over the past few months, long-cycle investment in the Middle East, offshore and gas markets remain decoupled from short-term pricing, which will continue to support the resilience of these markets. In North America, following a noticeable moderation of activity in the later part of 2023, we anticipate capital discipline to continue. Consequently, investment levels will be sustained at 2023 exit rates with minimum -- minimal increase in activity as the region focuses on sustaining its record output from last year. This will drive further adoption of technology as operators aim to further improve efficiency and recovery rates. Now let me explain how we expect these factors to drive our performance in 2024. In the international markets, we expect full year revenue growth reaching the mid-teens, led by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa. This growth will take place both onshore and offshore with offshore benefiting from our newly formed OneSubsea joint venture, which enters the year with close to $4.5 billion of subsea production system backlog. We expect to deliver more than $4 billion in additional subsea bookings in 2024, representing an increase of more than 25% year-on-year as the market continues to expand. For clarity, when excluding the impact of Aker contribution and the expected decline in Russia, we expect double-digit international growth for the year. Meanwhile, in North America, although activity has moderated, we expect full year revenue growth reaching the mid-single digits, driven by our technology-leveraged portfolio in both U.S. land and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Turning to the divisions. We expect all Core divisions to grow, led by Production Systems and Reservoir Performance. Digital & Integration is also expected to grow with digital growing in the high-teens, primarily driven by new technology platforms while APS remains flat. Directionally, we expect further margin expansion, driven by tight service capacity internationally, pricing and increased technology adoption. This will result in year-on-year EBITDA growth in the mid-teens. With continued growth in earnings, our proven ability to generate cash and confidence in the long-term outlook, we are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors have approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. And we'll also increase our share repurchase program in 2024. Combined, we are targeting a return -- to return more than $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2024, an increase of more than 25% compared to 2023. Looking to the first quarter. We anticipate the typical pattern of activity, beginning with the combined effects of seasonality and the absence of year-end digital sales. As a result, on a year-on-year basis, we expect first quarter revenue growth in the low-teens and EBITDA growth in the mid-teens. This will be followed by an activity rebound in the second quarter and further acceleration of growth in the second half of the year, particularly in the international markets. This will support the ambitions we have set for the full year revenue and earnings growth. I will now turn the call over to Stephane."", 'Stephane Biguet', 'Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.86. This represents an increase of $0.08 sequentially and an increase of $0.15 when compared to the same period of last year. We recorded $0.09 of charges during the fourth quarter of this year, $0.06 related to the devaluation of the peso in Argentina and the remaining $0.03 related to merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of the Aker subsea business, which closed at the beginning of the quarter. We anticipate that we will incur additional charges as integration activities continue over the course of 2024. Our full year 2023 revenue of $33.1 billion grew 18% year-on-year. While this revenue is roughly the same as the pre-pandemic level of 2019, our adjusted EBITDA in 2023 in absolute dollars was 22% higher. As a result, our full year 2023 EBITDA margin of 24.5% has expanded 430 basis points over this period on a similar revenue base. This highlights the high grading of our portfolio over the last few years, our significantly improved operating leverage and our favorable market position, particularly internationally and offshore. Fourth quarter revenue of $8.99 billion increased 8% sequentially with the acquired Aker subsea business accounting for approximately 70% of the increase. Fourth quarter pretax operating margin of 20.8% improved 52 basis points sequentially and 101 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 25.3% was 95 basis points higher than the same period of last year. I will now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1 billion increased 7% sequentially with pretax operating margin expanding 197 basis points to 34%. This growth was due to increased digital revenue across all areas, led by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.7 billion grew 3% sequentially, primarily due to increased activity internationally, mainly in the Middle East and Africa. Pretax operating margin increased 88 basis points to 21.4%, representing the highest level of this cycle, driven by higher activity and improved pricing. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion was essentially flat sequentially as international growth of 2% was offset by a decline in North America revenue, resulting from lower U.S. land rig count. Pretax operating margin increased 35 basis points sequentially. Lastly, Production Systems revenue of $2.9 billion increased 24% sequentially, largely due to the acquired Aker subsea business. Excluding this effect, revenue grew 4% sequentially due to strong international sales. Pretax operating margin expanded 153 basis points to 15%, its highest level this cycle on higher sales of midstream, artificial lift and subsea production systems. Looking ahead to the full year of 2024. We expect continued margin expansion in our Core, driven by sustained operating leverage, a favorable geographic mix and pricing tailwinds. In our Digital & Integration division, we expect margins to remain approximately at the same level as 2023 as digital margins will increase due to the accelerated adoption of our new technology platforms while APS margins will decrease as a result of higher amortization expenses. All in all, as mentioned by Olivier, strong year-on-year revenue growth and continued margin expansion will result in adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-teens in 2024 when compared to 2023. Now turning to our liquidity. We generated $3 billion of cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the fourth quarter. This exceptional performance resulted in full year free cash flow of $4 billion, which is the highest level we have achieved since 2015. This was due to a combination of very strong year-end receivable cash collections, increased customer advances, improved inventory turns and the receipt of a prior year tax return. As a result of this exceptional free cash flow performance, we reduced our net debt by $1.4 billion during the quarter to $8 billion. This represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Capital investments, including CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $742 million in the fourth quarter and $2.6 billion for the full year. Looking ahead, we will continue to be disciplined as it relates to our capital investments. Despite the continued revenue growth, our 2024 capital investments will remain at approximately the same level as in 2023. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock for a total purchase price of $100 million. For the full year, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Our continued capital discipline, combined with the confidence we have that 2024 will be another year of strong cash flow generation, will enable us to increase our returns to shareholders in 2024. In this regard, when combining the increased quarterly dividend that we announced today with increased share repurchases, we are targeting to return more than $2.5 billion to our shareholders in 2024. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.', 'Olivier Le Peuch', 'Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we will start the Q&A. So Leah, back to you.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And first, we go to the line of James West with Evercore ISI.', 'James Carlyle West', ""So Olivier, curious to hear your thoughts. Clearly, you're looking for another year of pretty strong growth in EBITDA and revenue. But it seems to me like we've got a lot of particularly deepwater rigs that are going to start turning to the right here very soon and particularly in the second half. And it's -- there should be an exit rate that's even higher than that type of growth as we go into '25. I think, is that a fair assumption? Or am I getting ahead of my skis here in terms of kind of what the overall market opportunity is going to be as we step through this year and get into the '25/'26 period?"", 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""No, that's correct. I think, James, thank you for laying out, I think, the theme of offshore. I think offshore is a distinct attribute of this cycle, has really already delivered in terms of total activity visibly beyond 2019 and includes both shallow and deepwater that have both grown visibly in the last 24 months, shallow, mainly driven by addition of rigs that we continue to see coming in the Middle East and Asia region and deepwater across all the deepwater basins. And we anticipate, albeit at a more moderate rate for deepwater and shallow, the rig activity to continue to increase and the exit rate of '24 to be above in terms of rig count, offshore rig count, total offshore rig count exit rate of '23 as a benefit. I think both the offshore activity and the deepwater, where we have the benefit of the scale with our subsea venture, will benefit. Hence, we continue to see growth, not only in '24 but running out to '25 and beyond. As I said, the total FID for offshore keeps being $100 billion for each of '24 and '25. And this is not only supporting activity next year and '25 but support longevity of offshore investments beyond. So we are -- we remain very constructive on that environment. And yes, we see the exit rate to be above last December in 12 months from now."", 'James Carlyle West', ""Okay, okay, perfect. That's great to hear. And then maybe a quick follow-up in terms of CapEx. I don't know, Stephane, if you want to take this one. But CapEx seems to be -- it seems like you're going to keep it at the same type of level that it's been that wasn't in '23. But there's going to be a lot of -- a lot more activity. And so does that number eventually need to move higher? And when it does, if it does, do you still believe that you could maintain this 5% to 6% of revenue per CapEx dollars ratio?"", 'Stephane Biguet', ""So look, James, yes, we are still growing going into '24 and beyond. But this level of CapEx we spent in '23, we think, remains adequate for this year as well. You have to think about the mix of activities as well amongst all divisions. So we think we can very well address the upcoming growth within this envelope without having to increase nominally throughout the year, unless growth is much more than expected. But we were comfortable with this and we will remain indeed within our guidance. And it's actually the low end of our guidance on the CapEx side."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays.', 'J. David Anderson', ""So maybe we could start off with the Middle East here. So another double-digit sequential quarter out of MENA, clearly an enormous runway of activity in front of you the next several years between unconventional gas and the number of capacity expansion projects underway. My question is how you see top line versus margins evolving. Can you maintain this pace of growth in the region in '24? Or are we getting close to capacity in terms of the number of rigs available, service equipment, even E&P capacity is pretty tight over there? And I guess, conversely, should we start seeing margins expand further as contracts reprice due to tightness? I noted that the tendering of Safaniyah was delayed by 9 months. I'm wondering maybe that's some sticker shock from pricing. So perhaps it's already underway, but just a little bit more details in terms of capacity and pricing in the Middle East, please."", 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""Yes. No, thank you, Dave. I think we have been very pleased with the activity and the way we have been able to turn this activity growth in the last 18 months and the last 12 months, particularly into revenue, benefiting from our strength on the ground in the Middle East. I think I would characterize beyond the capacity expansion and unconventional gas, which is a dual benefit for activity, I will also characterize the activity in the Middle East to be very broad. It's not two countries leading this, it's almost every country in the region that we see further activity and we'll derive from it further revenue growth. So we are not at capacity. We don't see an inflection down of our revenue growth potential in the region, benefiting from our technology, market position with each national company in the region and capability for integration to harness the power of our technology into performance for our customers, hence delivering higher revenue from rate of activity. So we are confident. When it comes to our capacity, yes, equipment capacity, and everybody has been disciplined in the region. And hence, we have been responding and benefiting from pricing in the last 18 months. And as a consequence, our margins have expanded in the region and have supported what you have seen as our international margin expansion year-on-year have been a driver for margin expansion internationally. We expect this to continue as we execute 2024. But again, it's a long duration cycle, both by the nature of the investment decoupled from short-term pricing on commodities. So we remain very confident about our market position first and the market outlook and our ability to differentiate to performance, integration, technology and then continue this success in '24 and '25 and again well into the second half of the decade."", 'J. David Anderson', ""Yes. A long way from the peak. That's pretty clear, at least in that part of the region. I was wondering if we could shift over on the digital side. I know there are a number of comments in the release today regarding increasing digital adoption by your customers. I was hoping you could expand on that a little bit. Is that simply about customers using DELFI more? Or as they get more comfortable with it, is there a certain application gaining traction? Is there any metrics you can give us in terms of year-over-year usage from your bigger customers? And I'm also just kind of curious, in order to grow digital revenue by essentially 50% over the next 2 years, is this primarily coming from an increased digital adoption of existing customers? Or do you also need new customers to get to that target?"", 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""Okay. Let me come back first on some metrics that I think we have highlighted into my opening remarks. And I think this relates to the adoption of DELFI, indeed, adoption of a number of users, use of cloud compute on our DELFI platform and use of additional edge or AI capability that we offer to our customers, the combination of which, as I said, has grown 60% in the last 2 years on a CAGR rate. And the adoption metrics that we shared, both the number of users and the number of hours of compute power that we serve to our customers on the cloud, have been growing by 40%. So yes, the adoption is growing, both measured by, as always said, one customer at a time that transition from our legacy desktop offering to our cloud and by expansion of our workflows, data, AI capability that we offer to existing or new customers. So it's a combination of transition of the existing customers to the cloud and adoption of data and AI capability because we are offering our platform that the industry is recognizing and adopting. And finally and maybe one of the most exciting part that adds a dimension of growth is the digital operation, both drilling and production digital operation. You have seen some of the announcements that have been highlighted in recent weeks and months. And last week, a further alignment with a partner to accelerate doing automation and autonomous systems, so the drilling adoption on the operation production with our partner, Cognite. And this is supplementing, I would say, the core growth of transitioning our geosound customers from desktop to the cloud. So you have three dimensions. You have the cloud transition with existing customers and adoption of new customers coming to SaaS solution. You have the data and AI. It's a new market. It's a rebirth of the data management that scale into the cloud and AI, unlocking the power of data through AI in our industry. And finally, digital operation. These three trends are supporting our growth ambition, both this year and next year. And this span all the customer segments across the globe. And you will keep seeing some announcement of customer adoption on our solutions."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to Scott Gruber with Citigroup.', 'Scott Andrew Gruber', ""I want to touch on Transition Technologies, you noted over $1 billion in sales. And I realize a lot of these are new and focused on emissions reduction. And I believe that the bucket there is separate from new energy, correct me if I'm not accurate. Olivier, I wanted to ask about the outlook for these technologies and the growth of sales of these technologies as the uptake by customers around the world seems pretty strong. Can you speak to the multiyear outlook? And is the cadence of growth for Transition Technologies additive to the growth rate from the Core?"", 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""No, I think you are correct first in stating that this is distinct from our focus on the five themes that we have in new energy and distinct from the CCS I mentioned, where we have a lot of success in geothermal. And it represents a portfolio of technology that we have that we are developing, that we are promoting to our customers that have a distinct lower emission carbon intensity compared to existing or legacy technology and have net effect on our customer for their Scope 1 or their Scope 3 upstream, as we call it, emissions but also have the characteristic to bring efficiency. So customer is looking for low-cost, low-carbon output and continue to adopt this technology by contrast with alternate technology that exists in the market as they deliver not only lower carbon but also deliver higher efficiency, which are the way we characterize this technology. So yes, we are very pleased with adoption. Some technology are very unique, like almost zero-carbon solution. Some solutions are really game-changing such as some of our processing -- subsea processing solution that's having a net impact on the carbon footprint of subsea operation. Some technology are disrupting for the future, such as electrical full -- subsea and electrical full completion technology. And hence, we are seeing accelerated adoption of this. And finally, we say that we are also seeing, following the COP28, much more interest into our methane emission management solution. And you have had seen the announcement we made with Eni, supporting them as a global company to make an assessment and assessing their emission intensity from methane and proposing abatement solutions. So this is a mix of technology, will continue to be growing in our technology mix and that supports our ambition for sustainable future and a balanced plan but also aligned with our customers on lower-carbon, lower-cost future."", 'Scott Andrew Gruber', ""Right. Got it. Appreciate that color. And then Stephane, one for you. Appreciate the cash return target for '24. Can you also provide some broader color on the cash conversion rate? The working capital release in 4Q was very impressive. So curious, thinking about the working capital outlook for '24, tax rate, et cetera."", 'Stephane Biguet', ""Scott, so look, yes, we were also very pleased with the fourth quarter and full year free cash flow. And indeed, in the fourth quarter, it's coming almost entirely from the working capital. So now we do expect, as I say, 2024, to be another very strong year of free cash flow. And it will show the same quarterly pattern we usually see. So in the first quarter, the working capital will clearly increase. We have the payment of annual incentives to employees, as you may know. And then we'll have the reversal of certain exceptional items that occurred in the last quarter of 2023. So we'll see the effect in Q1 as usual. But then this will be followed by a gradual improvement in subsequent quarters, in line with what we observed this year. So hopefully, we can have another very strong finish of the year in 12 months from now and deliver a strong performance as well."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.', 'Luke Michael Lemoine', 'Olivier, you noted the bookings and backlog at OneSubsea. And last call, you talked about some of the commercial and operational objectives. And I wanted to see if you could just talk about how customer engagement and dialogue has progressed with the enhanced offering you now have.', 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""Thank you, Luke. I think we are very pleased first with the first quarter of the subsea joint venture we have with Aker and Subsea 7. I think the results speak for themselves. I think it was a direct contributor to the PS, the Production Systems performance in the fourth quarter, both on the top line and the margins. So we are very pleased. And I think as I said, I could not be more pleased than this. Now going forward, I think our objective continues to be to extract more value through synergy and to fully seize this deepwater offshore cycle that is in full fledge happening, where we see, as I said earlier, a strong outlook. So our priority is to benefit from integration capability. And as you have seen that we have announced some alliance, and one of them with bp, where I think customers are approaching us, organizing that subsea integration capability across the SPS and SURF are augmented by our ability to deliver and understand the reservoir as well as deliver well construction. So hence, opportunity to have integrated asset development, integrated tieback delivery and more opportunity in the space that is a full integrated subsea and beyond to extract better economics and to extract more importantly -- equally importantly, a higher recovery, combining our reservoir subsurface domain expertise, our well placements and our subsea boosting and processing capability, all combined to extract and create a little bit of more value for subsea market going forward from economics and from production recovery. So that's where we see trends coming. And we have a portfolio that is unique with the portfolio particularly on the boosting and processing and tieback capability that is unmatched on the market. And we have digital reservoir technology on our Core portfolio that complements this and help and will support this alliance integration capability. So I can only be pleased with the prospects ahead of us. And the feedback from our customers so far is very positive on our capability."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Saurabh Pant with Bank of America.', 'Saurabh Pant', ""Olivier, maybe I want to touch on exploration a little bit. You talked about that on the call today. You highlighted Asia. I think you talked about China, Malaysia, India, some of the other countries exploring for gas. I know you've talked about exploration in the past. So we are seeing at least a little bit of a tangible recovery happening on the exploration side. Maybe you can expand on that a little bit. What do you expect over the next couple of years on both the gas and the oil side and just maybe remind us how impactful that is for SLB?"", 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""Yes, thank you. I think, yes, we have commented before that we have seen resurgence and rebound of exploration activity [especially] in the last 2 or 3 years. This cycle has added exploration activity back to the cycle. And I think it has been driven by the desire to find new gas reserves to respond to the gas supply security concerns. And also, it has benefited from the continued exploration of oil around the existing offshore hubs in the form of infrastructure-led exploration. And also, in new frontier, replicating the success that Exxon had in Guyana of their basins. So when you look at it from where it's happening, what is unique in this cycle, it's happening everywhere. We have exploration activity, mostly offshore. That's where I think the actual success of new reserves have been mostly and in all offshore basins, both shallow and deepwater, infrastructure-led exploration in existing mature or deepwater markets and in new frontier. So you have seen new frontier happening in Namibia. You have seen new frontier in Surinam, in upcoming Brazil Ecuador margin. You have exploration in East -- West Colombia side. You have furthermore in West Africa South. And you have what is maybe a little bit new this cycle, more exploration coming back in Asia from India, as I said, Malaysia, China. And I think this is what constitutes a little bit of the unique cycle is broad. And it's here, in my opinion, to stay because the economics of offshore have improved significantly over the last couple of cycles. And attributes of reserves, both gas and oil, with low-carbon intensity and the ability to deliver a long plateau of production is unique. So access to offshore acreage, better economics, better quality of potential geological reserves have all driven this. And we have increased the success. And we have exposure in Reservoir Performance with Reservoir Performance evaluation segments that are benefiting from it and has introduced technology that are really in high demand like Ora. And we have a lot of exposure, obviously, as well in the digital segment with our seismic data capability processing and our digital geosounds offering that both benefit from this as a consumption. So we are pleased with the market position we have. And we believe that this exploration appraisal is here to stay because it's very broad, diverse and across many basins, particularly in offshore."", 'Saurabh Pant', 'Fantastic, okay. I have one very quick follow-up, if I may, on the Middle East side. I know you talked about that on the prepared remarks and the Q&A early on. But just to go back to that, I think one thing you noted in the press release was that you expect the record Middle East growth to continue beyond 2025. If you can elaborate a little bit, Olivier, on what gives you the confidence, the line of sight beyond 2025. Maybe part of that is just on the gas side of things, not just oil, right? But elaborate a little bit on the line of sight you have beyond 2025 on the Middle East.', 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""Yes. I think first, you have to realize that the capacity expansion program announced by the multiple countries that have met their commitments extend from '27 to '30-plus, 2035 or '40 from the last country that have expanded this. And hence, I think the capacity will be -- continue to be seeing addition both land and offshore to respond to that capacity expansion. Gas, I think, is here for the long in the Middle East for two reasons. First, there are gas reserves that are really at a very good economic point, particularly in Qatar, and will continue to present an LNG feed to the global gas market. But also, unconventional reserves are seeing a significant investment. And we expect this to actually grow fast in the coming years in two or three countries that are focused on unconventional gas. So the combination of this is giving us the confidence that the record-ever investments that we have seen last year in Middle East will continue in '24, '25 and has potential to expand well into the second half of the decade."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.', 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', 'A couple of questions for me. The first is on EBITDA margins. Congrats on crossing that 25% EBITDA margin mark. How should we think about the margin path in 2024? And as you think about the upside and downside factors that could drive you on that metric, how should we think about that?', 'Stephane Biguet', ""Clearly, we see upside in '24 and continued margin expansion as we expressed earlier. Really, the -- I'm sure you will back-calculate, but our guidance of mid-teens EBITDA growth in absolute dollars will be achieved with revenue growth but clearly with margin expansion across our Core and in digital, as I mentioned. So yes, we continue to see margin expansion. We have great operating leverage. We have pricing tailwinds in our backlog and new technology adoption. And this is pushing margins together with the favorable mix. As you well know, offshore is helping margins as well. So it subside -- it's continued to subside from now on."", 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""Okay. It does sound like geo mix, operating leverage pricing, a lot of different factors there, that's helpful. And then in terms of North America, I recognize it's a smaller business for you. But you indicated in the comments, you expect in North America to grow in 2024 despite weaker rig count and activity. Can you talk about what's driving that and how you're able to outperform in the face of a tougher North America macro? And where are you seeing the technology adoption from a customer perspective?"", 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""No, we're very pleased with our performance in North America in retrospect in 2023 as we visibly outperformed the rig count and we were able to grow sequentially visibly. And we expect indeed to continue to outperform the market. And it comes from multiple factors, the mix factor of exposure we have with great exposure in Gulf of Mexico as well as East Canada and Alaska, where we see potential of technology adoption and giving us the benefits of our mix. But also, in the U.S. land market, I think we had a transition to a fit-for-basin and a technology leverage-focused portfolio in U.S. land and, to some extent, in Canada. And we have seen this as a success with adoption of some really unique drilling technology, particularly digital CCS giving us the tailwind to outperform the market in 2023, and we see this continuing. Now the priority for customers remain clearly efficiency and recovery in U.S. land market. And hence, more efficiency on the trading well construction side, more recovery, use of digital, use of ESPs and also low carbon when it matters will continue to make the impact and serve us very well. And the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other offshore market performance through integration, performance through execution and reliability of our execution, I think, will continue to be paramount for our customers. And as long as we continue to deliver at this level, we'll get rewarded with market position and contract and pricing. And hence, we'll be able to outperform the rig count, hence our guidance up to or reaching the mid-single digit in 2024 against the market outlook."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan."", 'Arun Jayaram', ""I wanted to get your thoughts on what you're seeing in the international markets in terms -- perhaps you could compare and contrast the spending behavior you're seeing from the NOCs versus the IOCs?"", 'Olivier Le Peuch', 'Thank you, Arun. I think if I were to characterize at the highest level, I think that we have seen significant traction in the last 2 years and rebound of investment internationally by the international companies with a delay coming from the contractual nature and also from the investment execution decision from national companies. We anticipate national companies to actually grow faster in -- as we turn into 2024, led in particular by the Middle East region with leading NOCs clearly growing. But I think the momentum we have gained, which was leading the pack to some extent in IOC in 2023, we expect due to the nature of our mix, offshore exposure still a very solid exploration appraisal for a few of them, will continue to give us momentum in the IOCs internationally. And I will not forget about international independents that have a market position, particularly in some offshore markets. And they are continuing to execute on their plan. And so we are pleased, and I think we are looking forward to the national companies accelerating collectively speaking their growth in 2024 compared to the IOCs.', 'Arun Jayaram', ""Great. And my follow-up, Olivier, at the Analyst Day in 2022, you highlighted a target of $3 billion in new energy revenue by the end of the decade. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of where you're at in terms of that path, that journey and maybe some of the areas where you're seeing the most traction today."", 'Olivier Le Peuch', 'I think as you remember and just resetting the scene for everyone, I think we had identified five domains which we believe we have adjacency, we have potential and we have a technology portfolio, we believe, to bring to market and disrupt and participate in a larger scale, CCS, geothermal/geo-energy, energy storage, critical mineral and hydrogen that are both -- that all of them have different horizons of growth and different scale potential for us. So we have been for the last 2 or 3 years seeding investments, developing organically and inorganically technology positions. We are very pleased with the momentum in CCS and geothermal going ahead of our expectation in terms of -- for CCS sequestration studies and participation to exploration in this market and geothermal by its growth potential going beyond the established basins. So we believe that our $3 billion target would be a combination of organic growth on these adjacent markets and inorganic development into the less adjacent markets. And we believe that CCS is likely to be leading in terms of potential contributor to this ambition, followed by likely hydrogen starting to be in a position that will more impact later part of the cycle in the next decade. So we feel confident by the early investment we are making. And we feel confident about the development of the market, the support of the incentive across many regions and early stage of success in CCS particularly as we execute this.', 'Operator', 'We have time for one more question, that is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.', 'Roger David Read', ""Congratulations on the quarter. Olivier, I'd like to follow up a little bit on the last question on the spending, IOCs, NOCs, international E&P, which you mentioned. We generally want to, let's say, look at the oil strip or assume a flat oil price. If spending is going to increase second half '24, a fairly positive outlook as you showed kind of '25 and beyond, would you characterize overall reinvestment by the industry is still too low, in other words, we don't need a higher oil price to get higher spending and investment? Or would you say we are simply dependent on oil prices? I'm just kind of curious, the way you're looking at it from, I guess, productive capacity, these companies and countries need and where they sit on excess capacity today versus that oil price outlook."", 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""I think I will turn it a little bit upside down and realize that, well, our operators are looking at it national companies, IOCs, then looking at the demand that we continue to grow throughout the decade and realize that if they continue to execute on their capital discipline, they need to accelerate the supply coming from international market to fulfill this demand that will continue to grow and will put more pressure on the demand-supply balance. So some of them are responding to capacity expansion program. Some of them are responding by accelerating the exploration appraisal or their development of existing international acreage that they have and development. So that's what we see. It applies to both for oil and gas. And gas is being more driven by regional dynamics on either consumption or gas security access, be it Asia or be it East Mediterranean, to feed Europe, Asia for energy security and domestic consumption. Both these factors are driven by demand. The economics at the current level, still favorable for long-cycle investment. The price of offshore international development and the economics have improved through the cycle. The benefits of efficiency, integration, technology have turned into making the offshore investment more attractive for the long run. Hence, it has re-attracted investments. I will not try to comment on does the industry needs more or less. I think the industry is certainly having the incentive today and have put a program in place with the FID pipeline that confirms that it is attractive. It will be met with demand in the long outlook and our confidence into the longevity of the cycle internationally and into the breadth and resilience across oil and gas of the investment profile we are seeing from operators."", 'Roger David Read', ""And then the follow-up question that kind of ties into that, obviously, a meaningful dividend raise here and a consistent increase in dividend from the COVID era. But as you look forward, recognizing it's the Board that decides the dividend, but how should we think about the dividend evolving back to the sort of 2014 to 2019 era, when it was substantially higher than today? I know there have been some changes, acquisitions and share count and all that. But whether it's an aggregate dollar dividend or a per share metric, how do you think about the dividend within the overall framework here?"", 'Stephane Biguet', ""Thanks for the question, Roger. Really, the way we look at it is it goes beyond the dividend. We prefer looking at the total payout to shareholders, including buybacks. So the dividend itself, yes, 10%, we're happy. We can do this. We're happy it was approved by our Board. It's on the back, of course, of the strong free cash flow generation we had in '23 and our confidence we can replicate that in the future. But we want to go at the right pace so that it remains sustainable in the future, and we can do more dividend increases in the future as long as they are reasonable. But again, total payout is what we are focusing on. We are increasing it from $2 billion in '23, including buybacks, to hopefully more than $2.5 billion in 2024. So if you back-calculate this, of course, with the new amount of dividend, that means a minimum of $1 billion of share buybacks. And as the year evolves, we will review that every quarter. And we'll address that potentially above the $1 billion minimum as reasonable."", 'Operator', ""And ladies and gentlemen, I'll turn the conference back to Olivier Le Peuch for closing comments. Please go ahead."", 'Olivier Le Peuch', ""Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results underscore SLB's differentiated ability to general returns throughout the cycle. We delivered strong revenue growth and free cash flow above expectations and continue to expand EBITDA and operating margins. With momentum across our three engines of growth and our returns-focused strategy in place, we will continue to build on this success in the year ahead. Second, the macro environment remains very compelling for our business with investment and activity predicated in international and offshore basins. Combined with tight service capacity and an emphasis on performance and digital, we are well positioned to expand our lead by delivering exceptional value to our customers. Finally, I remain very confident in our strategy and impressed by the outstanding performance of our teams. I'm fully confident in our ability to deliver our 2024 financial targets and continue increasing shareholder returns. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. With this, I will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining."", 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Those are the big-picture trends for investors to know heading into the new fiscal year. But there's more to this growth story than just those headline sales and earnings metrics. Here are three things you need to know before buying Roku stock in 2024."", 'Roku executives have been saying for years that the streaming video market can support excellent returns, even for companies focused on advertising sales. The next few quarters will test that growth thesis.', ""Roku doesn't rely on subscription fees like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), instead choosing to build a mostly advertising-fueled business model. That difference translated into very weak revenue and earnings trends as digital advertising spending softened last year. There's hope on the horizon, though."", ""In early November, Roku said its solid growth in video ad sales significantly outperformed the traditional TV ad market. The company's scale is helping it attract more advertisers, large and small, and the business is also getting a lift from huge partnerships with companies like Spotify. Roku will need to show continued market share gains in its core platform business for the stock to extend its positive momentum deeper into 2024."", ""Roku's stock jumped in response to its restructuring plan, announced in September, that aims to slash costs across the business. The company is spending less on content and real estate and is cutting its workforce by about 10%. To date, investors haven't seen a positive financial impact from these changes. In fact, net losses ballooned to over $600 million through the first three quarters of 2023, compared to a $260 million loss a year earlier."", ""The restructuring moves should be completed by the end of Q4, though, likely pushing Roku back toward profitability this year. It's possible that the streamer will disappoint Wall Street here with only modest improvements. However, with sales growth accelerating and costs falling, there's a good chance investors will see much better earnings results from Roku in 2024."", ""The biggest worry for investors considering this stock is its elevated price tag. Roku is valued at nearly 4 times its annual sales, which is expensive, given that the business currently generates so much red ink. Netflix isn't much more expensive at 6 times its annual revenue."", ""Roku's management team hasn't proven there's a sustainably strong operating model in this approach yet, and they still need to diversify away from their exposure to volatile advertising demand. Look for the company to progress on this score through big partnerships and a push to market more smart home devices in 2024."", ""Meanwhile, investors can expect volatility around Netflix's late-January earnings announcement. That report will feature a big update on the advertising market and other key industry trends, like content costs."", 'With its subscription-based selling approach, Netflix has demonstrated it can easily produce operating profits of more than 20% of sales.

My guess is, neither of them has ever played a game in their lives, and it shows. They clearly have no idea what they're doing. So their strategy is to offer things on Netflix that you can't get elsewhere. And the problem is that consumers can get games pretty much anywhere, and they don't really think of Netflix as the place to go. So they're trying to do the same strategy with games that they have with TV and film, you know, exclusive content. It's just not going to work."", 'I mean, the smarter thing to do would be to put all sorts of games on your landing screen on Netflix. So let us play ""Candy Crush"" but launch it from our Netflix app, as opposed to having to go to our PC or go into a separate app. And if they get consumers used to playing, that\'ll work. So long-term strategy is going to have to change. This one is doomed. There\'s no chance they ever make money from this.', 'They did recently back off of that exclusive thing by adding the ""Grand Theft Auto"" mobile trilogy. I know you guys are dying to buy that. It\'s 11.99 on your iPhone. And it is free on Netflix. So go for it. There have been over 20 million downloads. So consumers will respond to something that they\'d have to pay for elsewhere and get it free on Netflix. But that costs money. I\'m sure that Netflix had to spend 20 or 40 million bucks to get that exclusive.', 'I think they have to do a lot more of that. And instead of paid downloads, they should just offer free-to-play games like ""Fortnite"" that otherwise we wouldn\'t be playing on our phones because ""Fortnite"" is banned from the App Store, for example.']"

With this adjustment, the average retiree benefit reached $1,827 per month, marking a $146 increase from the year 2022.

In addition, the industry is expected to witness a 12.8% increase in earnings in 2024, slightly surpassing the 11.8% growth anticipated for the S&P 500.

Both companies provided shareholders with a total return (stock price plus dividends reinvested) on par with the S&P 500's 26% return."", 'These two tech giants are far from finished, though. After lapping a boom-bust cycle for digital payments during the pandemic, followed by a surge in interest rates from central banks fighting inflation (higher interest rates lower the present value of a stock), Visa and Mastercard could have another great decade ahead of them. This could be true even if a return to more sluggish economic growth is right around the corner.', ""Here's why Visa and Mastercard are great stocks to build a portfolio around in 2024 and beyond."", 'First, let\'s talk valuation. Both Visa and Mastercard\'s earnings multiples have contracted in the last couple of years because of the aforementioned spike in interest rates from near-zero to now over 5%. As a result, Visa and Mastercard stocks haven\'t been this ""cheap"" in years.', 'Cheapness is relative, though, because neither company is exactly a screaming value at this point. Clearly, investors expect modest revenue growth (high single digits to low teens on average) for years to come.', ""Is that a reasonable assumption? It could be. Digital payment infrastructure still has a head of steam behind it. In many areas of the globe, cash is still king. And in others where digital payments have made significant headway, it's impossible to track exactly how much cash is still being used to enact daily transactions between people and businesses."", ""In fact, according to Worldpay (a division of fellow payments technologist Fiserv), some 1.4 billion of the world's approximate 6 billion adult population still have no bank account at all -- most of them in emerging markets with young populations."", ""Suffice it to say, there's plenty of room for more digital payments expansion, especially in tandem with smartphones and app-based services (versus traditional cards issued by a bank). Add on Visa and Mastercard's steady investment in data security services and the like, and these two could indeed keep putting up the kind of steady growth numbers investors have come to expect, even if global economic growth continues to slow in the aftermath of the pandemic."", ""But there's more to this story than just growth. As I wrote a few months ago, Visa in particular has been an exceptional business at generating above-average return on invested capital (ROIC) -- a way to measure the profit a company has generated from money it has invested in itself."", ""There's another way to view this ability to convert invested dollars into more cash: the amount of capital expenditures (spending on property and equipment) versus growth in net income and free cash flow. Again, you can see for every dollar Visa spends, it has generated far more than that in profit."", ""Visa's data centers and private communications network are top-notch and incredibly efficient. There's hope that Mastercard's smaller payments network can achieve a similar financial effect over time."", ""Either way, both Visa and Mastercard have managed to increase their already incredibly high profit margins over the last decade -- and they're still rising. That gives these two financial technology leaders ample cash to invest, repurchase stock, and increase their dividends."", 'Perhaps shares of Visa and Mastercard will dip at some point this year. Earnings reports that will include an outlook for calendar year 2024 will be delivered late in January, which tends to add a shot of volatility to stock prices.', ""But I don't expect much in the way of an operational surprise from these two leading tech giants. Visa and Mastercard are both great stocks to add to your core portfolio and hold for the very long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

Although the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, it was the 43% gain by the growth-stock-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) that stole the spotlight.', 'Yet in spite of this sizable bounce from the 2022 bear market lows, the high-flying Nasdaq Composite remains more than 7% below its all-time high, which was set in November 2021.', ""While a decline in the growth-stock-fueled Nasdaq Composite over the past 26 months may not be what short-term traders expected, it's music to the ears of long-term-minded investors. Even though we can't pinpoint ahead of time when stock market corrections will begin, history has shown that every downturn in the major indexes (including the Nasdaq) will be eventually (key word!) wiped away by a bull market rally."", ""What follows are four marvelous growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip."", ""The first exceptional growth stock that's begging to be bought with the Nasdaq Composite still notably below its record high is payment facilitator Mastercard (NYSE: MA)."", ""The top concern for financial stocks like Mastercard is that they're cyclical. In other words, they ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. economy."", ""With a couple of money-focused metrics and predictive tools forecasting a U.S. recession in 2024, there's the genuine possibility that consumer and enterprise spending could taper as the year wears on. As a predominantly fee-based business, Mastercard would struggle during a recession."", ""On the other hand, recessions don't last very long. Only three of the one dozen recessions since 1945 have lasted at least a year, with none surpassing 18 months. Since expansions typically last multiple years, companies like Mastercard are often thriving."", ""To add to the above, Mastercard's management team has made the wise decision to steer clear of the lending space. Though the company would probably excel as a lender, economic downturns would expose it to loan losses that require capital to be set aside. Not having to set aside capital is a competitive advantage that supports the company's 40%-plus profit margin and allows it to bounce back from recessions faster than most lending institutions."", ""Mastercard's opportunity in largely underbanked emerging markets, coupled with its established position in developed markets, should double its earnings per share over a five-year stretch (2022-2027). With an annualized estimated earnings growth rate of nearly 21% over the coming five years, Mastercard stock remains cheap."", ""A second marvelous growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market decline is biotech stock BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: BMRN)."", 'The biggest argument skeptics can bring to the table for BioMarin is that shares are currently pricey. On a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, investors are paying north of 120 times earnings. While this does represent quite the premium to the broader market, a projected 43% annualized earnings growth rate over the next five years should more than make up for these concerns.', ""BioMarin's competitive edge is that it focuses on developing therapies for patients with ultrarare diseases. Though there are monetary risks involved with developing drugs targeting a small pool of patients, there are also ample rewards for approved therapies. Health insurers rarely push back on high list prices for rare-disease drugs, and there's usually little competition."", 'Though BioMarin has more than a half-dozen approved therapies, its dwarfism drug Voxzogo is making the biggest impact. Voxzogo sales more than tripled through the first nine months of 2023, when compared to the prior-year period, and have the potential to eventually top $1 billion in peak annual sales. New drug launches, coupled with organic growth from existing therapies, have put BioMarin on a path to double its full-year sales to north of $4 billion by 2027.', ""Lastly, don't forget that healthcare stocks are incredibly defensive. No matter what the U.S. economy throws consumers' way, patients will still need prescription medicine. This suggests that BioMarin Pharmaceutical's operating cash flow can remain strong and predictable in any economic climate."", ""The third amazing growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not purchasing in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market swoon is burgeoning e-commerce company Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY)."", ""Similar to Mastercard, the prevailing headwind for Etsy would be a recession taking shape in 2024. Etsy's platform is driven by consumer purchases, and it's no secret that consumers spend less when economic growth weakens. But as I pointed out with Mastercard, periods of economic expansion handily outlast recessions. For long-term investors, this is a numbers game that's very much in their favor."", 'What makes Etsy\'s operating model ""tick"" is the company\'s merchant base. Whereas e-commerce giants like Amazon dominate from a volume perspective, there\'s not a big attempt to personalize the buying process. Etsy\'s entire merchant base is comprised of sole proprietors and small businesses that\'ll customize orders. No e-commerce platform can, at scale, match the personalization that Etsy\'s merchant base brings to the table.', 'At the same time, Etsy has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on habitual buyers. A ""habitual buyer"" is someone who makes six or more purchases over the TTM period, with the aggregate of these purchases totaling at least $200. Over the four-year period between Sept. 30, 2019 and Sept. 30, 2023 (i.e., beginning prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), the number of habitual buyers tripled to 7.1 million. Habitual-buyer growth is what gives Etsy phenomenal fee-pricing power with merchants and has helped fuel a modest increase in its take rate.', ""Although Etsy's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26 might seem a bit lofty, considering the uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy, its consensus annualized earnings growth rate of 16% over the next five years implies it's still inexpensive."", ""A fourth marvelous growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)."", ""Not to sound like a broken record, but the fear of a recession could be the biggest monkey on Meta's proverbial back in the new year. Meta generates in excess of 98% of its revenue from advertising, and advertisers are known to pare back their spending at the first signs of trouble. It's one of the reasons why Meta struggled mightily in 2022."", ""Thankfully, Meta Platforms has easily identifiable catalysts and moats working in its favor. For example, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger collectively helped the company attract close to 4 billion monthly active users during the September-ended quarter. Businesses are keenly aware that no social media platform offers them access to more eyeballs than Meta's top-tier social media real estate. As a result, the company typically enjoys exceptional ad-pricing power."", ""Meta's operating cash flow and balance sheet are additional reasons this stock is a surefire buy. Despite widening losses from virtual and augmented reality segment Reality Labs, Meta still generated $51.7 billion in net cash from its operations through the first nine months of 2023. When coupled with its greater-than $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, it's clear the company has the luxury of taking risks on next-big-thing investment trends."", 'The final reason to confidently buy Meta Platforms is its valuation. Even after quadrupling from its bear market lows in 2022, Meta stock remains historically cheap. Shares can currently be purchased for about 12X forward-year cash flow, which represents a 22% discount to the average cash flow multiple Meta has traded at over the previous five years.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them.

Joke’s on him, though, because everyone else seems to.', 'Up-to-date info isn’t available, but it’s now known that investors have poured at least $1.9 billion into the new crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds in their first three days of trading. The most bullish estimates expect up to $100 billion flowing into bitcoin funds by the end of the year.', 'This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.', 'That’s a lot of pent-up demand, beating the last record inflows of $1.2 billion within three days in 2021 … which also went into a bitcoin-based product, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (which tracked bitcoin futures rather than its spot price), Reuters reported.', 'See also: Bitcoin Instantly Topped Silver in ETF Market and Trails Only Gold Among Commodities', 'A number of marquee financial firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton lined up to launch bitcoin ETFs, and are now also considering ether [ETH] funds. And yet, Sommer seems ready to write all of this off.', '""FOMO is the main reason for putting money into Bitcoin, which remains highly speculative, difficult to categorize and without an immediately identifiable economic function,” the NYT columnist wrote in his latest edition of the “Strategies” newsletter, referencing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) anti-FOMO bulletin.', 'FOMO, aka the fear of missing out, is certainly a part of crypto investing. For instance, it’s the main driver behind degens chasing the highs of meme coins like BONK or dogwifhat, which truly serve little economic function beyond speculation.', 'But to write off bitcoin simply as a turn of the roulette wheel with $800 billion on the table is to willingly mislead oneself. You don’t have to personally believe what bitcoiners believe to take their arguments seriously, for fear of mockery or ostracization (FOMOO) by your crypto-skeptic peers, Jeff.', 'To be fair, Sommer did tip his hat to the technology behind Bitcoin, i.e. b l o c k c h a i n, to hedge his own argument. To wit:', '“Bitcoin is a serious proposition, in terms of its underlying structure. The use of blockchain, the decentralized, peer-to-peer structure and the complex mathematical code demand respect. Concepts embedded in Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies could have real-world importance at some point…”', 'This was not Sommer’s only completely original and novel thought, he also steadfastly argued that cryptocurrency is a “misnomer” because cryptocurrencies, despite maybe one day having “real-world” utility somewhere, are not really “currencies.” And, he said, the comparison between bitcoin and gold is off because gold has historical “cache.”', ""As the great and powerful Satoshi Nakamoto once said, “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.” At this point it’s not even worth addressing these extremely tired arguments, which seem to be carried out by seasoned journalists everytime crypto notches some victory."", 'But considering that they’re brand new, I’ll try to do Sommer a solid and get him up-to-date on why interest in bitcoin ETFs is more than FOMO.', 'First, there is Bitcoin’s philosophical proposition — the idea that there ought to be a global, stateless monetary network available to all. Often called a libertarian wet-dream, the Bitcoin vision is so simple it actually slots neatly into a range of political philosophies — from globalizing neoconservatism to historical Marxism, just not anything truly authoritarian.', 'Again, you don’t have to buy into the rising trend towards populism to take an interest in it. Many people are feeling with the spread of corporate and governmental surveillance; rising economic inequality; and other geopolitical issues that something like Bitcoin, which empowers everyone without asking for anything of any particular user in return, is a powerful symbol at the very least.', 'Second, there is the fact that bitcoin is one of the most successful economic investments on record. It may not be the best performing asset every year, and certainly many people have lost money trading it, but there is no denying bitcoin’s meteoric gains over the past decade and a half.', 'See also: Bitcoin ETF Net Inflows Near $1B After Three Days', 'This is where the idea of “hodling” comes in, which recommends people buy and hold bitcoin over a long time horizon, because even if the always-volatile bitcoin dips, those are only paper-losses until you sell. Bitcoin ETFs help a larger swath of retail and institutional buyers access BTC, typically through vehicles like retirement accounts or corporate treasuries that will likely hodl for years if not decades.', 'True, bitcoin is not guaranteed to rise in price and could even drop to $0. And true, as Sommer points out, there are other ways to gain exposure to crypto via traditional routes, like buying other indexes that invest in crypto-related stocks, like Coinbase, MicroStrategy or the many publicly listed mining companies.', 'Simply put, there is something powerful to the idea of actually owning an asset that cannot be seized. Spot bitcoin ETFs are a poor approximation of that since buyers of the ETFs never actually get their hands on bitcoin.', 'But Sommer is shutting himself off to that idea early, and trying to convince his readers that the massive interest in bitcoin that was just demonstrably proven via the launch of 11 bitcoin ETFs this month is all just FOMO. The sad thing is, the argument works just as well in reverse: Even if demand for bitcoin is just a matter of social contagion, then so is skepticism, because you need to hear about something to turn away from it. So, check your sources.', 'CORRECTION (JAN. 19, 2024): Removes reference to in-kind redemptions, which were not part of the SEC process.']"

The MSCI index for Latin American currencies was up 0.4% at 1930 GMT against a steady dollar, but set for weekly declines of 1.3%.

A broader gauge of Latin American equities rose 0.8% but was set for a weekly loss of 3.4% - the steepest since early October.

As a result, the committee will meet on Jan. 31 to vote on a subpoena, which, according to Sanders, would be the first time that’s happened since 1981.', 'Sanders’ statement specifically calls out the U.S. prices of Merck’s diabetes drug Januvia and cancer immunotherapy Keytruda, as well as J&J’s lymphoma treatment Imbruvica and its HIV medicine Symtuza. Keytruda, for instance, costs $191,000 per year in the U.S. but $89,000 in Germany. J&J’s Imbruvica is priced at $204,000 in the U.S., but $46,000 in the U.K., the statement said.', '“The pharmaceutical companies they run may make billions in profits,” said Sanders in the statement. “But that does not give them a right to evade congressional oversight. It is time to hold these pharmaceutical companies accountable for charging the American people the highest prices in the world for the medicine they need.”', 'In a Jan. 12 letter to Sanders, Brian Smith, a lobbyist with J&J’s D.C. law firm Covington & Burling, argued that it wasn’t appropriate for the company to testify because collaborator AbbVie sets Imbruvica’s prices. J&J also only holds U.S. rights to the blood thinner Xarelto, another drug under scrutiny. A third medicine the committee has flagged, Stelara, will lose a key patent in early 2025, paving the way for competition from biosimilars.', 'Merck General Counsel Jennifer Zachary, meanwhile, stated in a Jan. 12 letter that the drugmaker “is committed to working with the U.S. government to enable patient-focused innovation, value and access,” and has supported initiatives that lower out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries.', 'Both companies also believe the hearing amounts to retaliation against drugmakers, many of which have sued the federal government to block the price negotiating power Medicare has received through the Inflation Reduction Act.', '“Your insistence on the appearance of the CEOs at the hearing ... unfortunately elevates our concerns that the hearing is being called to punish the companies who have chosen to engage in constitutionally protected litigation,” Smith’s letter read.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

Shares of both drugmakers have plunged as the demand for their respective COVID-19 vaccine declined significantly.', 'Problems often present opportunities, though. Pfizer and Moderna just might be rebound candidates in 2024. But which of these two stocks is the better bull market buy? Two Fool.com contributors weigh in on how Pfizer and Moderna stack up against each other.', ""Adria Cimino (Pfizer): Pfizer's revenue soared to a record high of more than $100 billion in 2022 thanks to its coronavirus products. But today, the company's coronavirus vaccine, Comirnaty, and treatment, Paxlovid, actually are hurting revenue growth. That's because demand for these products has waned significantly in these later stages of the pandemic."", ""At the same time, some of Pfizer's other best-selling drugs are facing losses of exclusivity this decade. All of this may sound pretty grim, but there's one big reason to buy Pfizer stock in spite of these challenges: new products. The company is completing its biggest phase of product launches ever, with 19 new products or indications entering the market over an 18-month period."", 'Pfizer predicts these products will generate $20 billion in revenue in 2030, more than compensating for the $17 billion in lost product revenue due to patent expirations of older blockbusters. On top of this, Pfizer also is set to add to revenue thanks to a string of acquisitions in recent times. The latest is oncology specialist Seagen, which Pfizer says should contribute more than $3 billion to revenue this year.', ""And, importantly, the acquisition boosts Pfizer's position in oncology with expertise in antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) -- or products that use the power of antibodies to target tumors with drugs designed to destroy them. ADCs may be on the road to replacing chemotherapy in the treatment of some tumor types, so strength here could represent a significant key to growth."", ""Of course, Pfizer's growth won't take off overnight. The company expects coronavirus product revenue of $8 billion this year, a dramatic drop from $55 billion back in 2022. And sales of older blockbusters will hurt revenue before newer products fully compensate. But for patient investors, Pfizer may be worth the wait -- since the company is setting the stage for a new era of growth later this decade and into the next. And considering this, today, trading at only about 12 times forward earnings estimates, Pfizer shares look like a steal."", ""Keith Speights (Moderna): Adria's key points for Pfizer also apply to Moderna. Yes, sales for the company's COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax have plummeted and pulled down Moderna's share price. However, Moderna could be about to begin an important new chapter thanks to the introduction of new products."", 'In particular, Moderna is only a few months away from a potential U.S. approval of its messenger RNA (mRNA) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. The company has high hopes for its RSV vaccine. Assuming it wins regulatory approval, it will be the only prefilled syringe product on the market at the time of its anticipated launch later this year.', 'Just how important is this second product to Moderna? The RSV vaccine could enable the company to return to organic sales growth in 2025. Moderna also expects to again reach breakeven in 2026.', 'And there are more new products potentially on the way as well. Moderna plans to file for approvals of its seasonal flu vaccine mRNA-1010 this year. It should report results from a late-stage study evaluating a combination flu and COVID-19 vaccine in 2024. The company also is on track to announce efficacy data later this year from its pivotal late-stage study of cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidate mRNA-1647.', 'Moderna and its big partner, Merck, are expanding late-stage studies of mRNA-4157 in combination with Keytruda in treating melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Results released from a phase 2b study showed that this combo could be highly effective in treating melanoma, with a 49% reduction in the risk of recurrence or death.', 'The bottom line for Moderna is that the worst appears to be over, with seemingly brighter days ahead. With its market cap now at close to $40 billion, investors could soon be attracted yet again to this once high-flying biotech stock.', 'Wall Street appears to be somewhat split on Pfizer versus Moderna. The average 12-month price targets for Pfizer and Moderna reflect upside potentials of 12% and nearly 25%, respectively. However, 12 of 22 analysts surveyed by LSEG rate Pfizer as a buy or strong buy, compared to only 10 of 24 for Moderna.', 'Both of these stocks could bounce back with the market in a bullish mood. However, income investors will prefer Pfizer with its juicy dividend yield of nearly 5.9%. Value investors will also likely gravitate toward Pfizer.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

If you wish to see more such stocks within our list, you can go directly to read the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Healthcare Stocks To Consider.', 'Globally, retirees are exploring investment opportunities to supplement their income, driven by the highest inflation recorded in nearly four decades. In response to this concern, the Social Security Administration addressed the issue by announcing an 8.7% increase in benefits earlier in 2023 to mitigate the impact of inflation, as reported by Bloomberg. With this adjustment, the average retiree benefit reached $1,827 per month, marking a $146 increase from the year 2022. However, given the average annual household expenses for individuals aged 65-74 amounting to approximately $53,000, these social security benefits fall short of adequately covering living costs.', 'In times of economic challenges, investors, particularly those looking forward to a secure retirement, tend to lean towards low-risk stocks that offer reasonable returns amid heightened uncertainties. Consequently, healthcare and consumer stocks often become the preferred choices when navigating significant macroeconomic headwinds. The healthcare industry has undergone profound changes, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. Advances in medical technology, pharmaceuticals, and treatment methodologies have brought about a revolution in patient care and outcomes.', ""The healthcare sector includes a broad spectrum of companies, covering pharmaceuticals, manufacturers of medical equipment and devices, providers of medical insurance, and various other healthcare services. Due to the diverse range of services offered, which frequently contribute to higher life expectancy and enhanced quality of life, the healthcare sector plays a substantial role in the global economic landscape. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, government data highlights that health spending in the US is anticipated to reach nearly $7.2 trillion by 2031. This spending is projected to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy in the coming years. Healthcare expenses are expected to constitute 19.6% of the country's total economic output (GDP), up from 18.3% in 2021. In addition, the industry is expected to witness a 12.8% increase in earnings in 2024, slightly surpassing the 11.8% growth anticipated for the S&P 500. This growth is fueled, in part, by an elevated demand for products such as obesity drugs."", ""Pharmaceutical companies, an extension of the overall healthcare industry, are commonly categorized as defensive, given their role in producing essential health maintenance and illness treatment products. The demand for these products tends to remain relatively stable, even during economic downturns. Notably, the sector provided favorable returns to investors in 2022, marked by the S&P 500's weakest annual performance since 2008. From December 2021 to December 2022, the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index recorded a gain of 4.91%, contrasting sharply with the S&P 500's significant 19.4% decline. Over the past 5 years, the index has shown an increase of 67.48%. With that in mind, some of the best healthcare stocks to buy for a retirement stock portfolio include the likes of Pfizer Inc.

Nothing happens without money moving through the system to make things happen. The financial sector is a sure-fire place to look for investment opportunities.', 'The best investment opportunities often come from buying into companies with promising futures that have stocks trading at bargain-basement valuations. Several fintech stocks match that description, making their stocks no-brainer buys. The best part? You can buy a share of these fintechs for less than $200 all-in.', 'Here are three fat stock pitches hovering over home plate today. Their potential market-beating returns make them home runs possibilities worth buying right now.', ""People may take access to a bank somewhat for granted in the U.S., but those in Latin America cannot. An estimated 122 million people in Latin America are unbanked, meaning they don't even have basic bank accounts. This makes Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) an exciting investment opportunity. The company provides banking services to roughly 90 million people in Mexico, Brazil, and Columbia."", 'Nu has excellent momentum. It has nearly tripled its customer base in just the past three years. Additionally, Nu has expanded its products and services. More customers using more services has fueled tremendous revenue growth. Its Q3 revenue was $2.1 billion, up 53% year over year.', ""Every growing business strives to reach the point where its costs stop increasing and its profits begin taking off. Nu's business hit that critical threshold in 2023. Its Q3 net income was $303 million, up from just $8 million in 2022."", ""Shares trade at a forward P/E of just 23 despite Nu's newly surging earnings growth. It seems Nu will quickly outgrow its current valuation if this performance continues. Given its opportunities to further penetrate the market for banking services in its region, there's no reason to believe it can't. That makes it a stock worth buying today in the expectation that its impressive operating results will eventually drive shares higher."", ""Founded in the late 1990s, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is somewhat of an artifact in fintech. It was one of the first online payment networks, and today, its roughly 430 million merchants and consumers are driving $1.5 trillion in total payment volume. Sometimes, old-guard companies get overlooked, especially in competitive spaces. However, PayPal's long run could be a testament to its competitive strength."", ""The stock has sunk over the past couple of years due to a combination of market volatility and the impression that PayPal is growing long in the tooth and can't compete with newer competitors. The company has begun addressing the second concern. In the fall, it hired CEO Alex Chriss, who came as an executive from Intuit. He's leaning into making PayPal a more profitable business and is strategizing how to re-establish the company in the payments space."", ""PayPal may have to prove it still has the juice, but the business still generates a lot of value as is, and its compelling valuation ultimately makes the stock a no-brainer. Shares trade at a forward P/E ratio of just 11. Meanwhile, analysts estimate the company's long-term earnings growth will average 14%. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which is below 1, signals that PayPal is a bargain based on its expected growth."", ""A company can thrive in a competitive industry without being the biggest player in it. Sometimes, it's about finding a niche you're good at. Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) has done just that. The payments company specializes in the restaurant, entertainment, and hospitality industries. Consistent execution in these specialties has helped Shift4 grow its payment volume from $5.9 billion in Q3 2019 to $27.9 billion in Q3 2023, a nearly fivefold increase in four years."", ""Competitive industries can sometimes make it hard to profit, but Shift4 is already doing well. The company generates free cash flow and net income, translating to earnings per share (EPS) of roughly $2.91 for 2023. Analysts believe its earnings will grow by 45% annually over the long term. Look for continued expansion in Shift4's core markets and international expansion to drive that growth. The company acquired cross-border payments company Finaro to kick-start its expansion into Europe."", ""The stock is another example of a company with underappreciated growth ahead. Shift4 trades at a forward P/E ratio of just under 20, and a PEG ratio of less than 0.5. In other words, Shift4's long-term earnings growth could only come in at half what analysts expected, and the stock would still be a bargain at today's price.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward.

A closer look at the company and its stock suggests there are several reasons to still consider an investment in Big Blue, particularly if you hold shares over the long haul. Let me explain.', ""IBM's long-term growth prospects look favorable because the company is focused on two large, expanding markets: artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The AI market alone has years of growth ahead with forecasts predicting the industry will reach nearly $2 trillion in annual revenue by 2030, a substantial increase from 2023's $208 billion."", 'IBM views these two industries not as separate markets, but as interconnected, particularly considering the massive data typically stored in the cloud that AI relies on to execute tasks. This led to Big Blue tackling these markets with a unified strategy centered around a hybrid approach.', ""Take cloud computing, for starters. IBM specializes in a hybrid cloud, which combines the lower cost of public cloud infrastructure shared across organizations with the security and privacy of a private cloud dedicated to a specific company. A hybrid cloud is ideal for Big Blue's clients in industries with regulatory requirements, such as finance, government, and healthcare. Some IT tasks (hosting a website, for instance) can use a public cloud. Confidential data, including financial and customer records, is better suited for a private cloud."", 'IBM sees the AI industry also moving toward a hybrid approach. CEO Arvind Krishna said on the company\'s third-quarter earnings call, ""We believe that generative AI will be multimodal, with clients using a combination of IBM\'s models, other companies\' models, their own proprietary models, and open-source models."" The AI industry adopting a hybrid approach grants Big Blue\'s AI solutions an advantage, given its integration with the company\'s Red Hat hybrid cloud platform, which Krishna describes as ""the foundation that allows clients to operate in a hybrid environment.""', ""IBM's synergy across AI and cloud computing has translated into sales growth. The company's AI and data division experienced a 6% year-over-year revenue jump in the third quarter, while its Red Hat cloud business saw a 9% increase. These businesses fall under IBM's software segment, which grew Q3 revenue by 8% year over year as the division delivered $6.3 billion of the company's $14.8 billion in sales."", ""In addition, with last year's surge in demand for AI, businesses rushed to adopt AI technology but needed help implementing these solutions. That's where IBM's army of 20,000 AI consultants proved an advantage, enabling the company's consulting arm to grow its Q3 revenue segment by 6% year over year to reach $5 billion."", ""IBM is also developing quantum computing technology.

So, in many ways, its business isn't just back to pre-pandemic levels, but exceeding them. Yet, unlike peer Royal Caribbean (NYSE: RCL), Carnival's stock hasn't recovered anywhere near pre-pandemic levels. Here's one important factor that helps explain the situation and something that investors should monitor."", ""Carnival's stock price is up some 60% over the past year. That's a huge price increase in a very short period, but the shares are still off by roughly two-thirds from where they started in 2020 before the coronavirus pandemic hit. By comparison, Royal Caribbean is up 90% over the past year and has clawed back to within striking distance of its pre-pandemic level, down just 9% or so from where it started in 2020."", 'And yet, Carnival had some very good news to report when it issued third-quarter 2023 earnings.

Given the strength of its advanced bookings, it looks likely that Carnival's success will continue into 2024."", 'So why is its stock still trading so far below pre-pandemic levels? And why has it lagged so far behind a peer like Royal Caribbean? One very big reason is leverage.', ""When the coronavirus pandemic was in its early stages, countries around the world shut non-essential businesses. That included cruise lines. When the restrictions were eased, customers didn't exactly flock back right away. With limited revenue, cruise lines had to raise capital to cover the costs they still had to pay. Carnival's debt-to-equity level was around 0.45 times coming into 2020, which is a completely reasonable figure. In fact, it was perhaps conservative relative to Royal Caribbean, which sat at around 0.9 times."", ""But then things dramatically changed. By the middle of 2023, Carnival's debt-to-equity level had risen to more than 5.7 times equity. That's a shocking increase and suggests that Carnival's balance sheet is highly leveraged. In fairness, Royal Caribbean's debt-to-equity ratio at that point was even higher, at around 6 times, but there's an important difference. Royal Caribbean's leverage was coming down more quickly, having peaked at around 8 times. At that point, Carnival's leverage was still on the rise."", ""Fast-forward to the third quarter and Carnival's debt-to-equity ratio has now started to come down. But Royal Caribbean's is dropping as well. They are now roughly similar, showing that Royal Caribbean is still reducing debt with more urgency than Carnival. That's probably the right call, given the cyclical nature of the cruise industry. Indeed, if there's a recession, demand for cruises is probably going to decline and then both companies may need to lean on their balance sheets again to keep their respective fleets afloat."", ""Now add in the fact that Royal Caribbean's earnings were strongly in the black in the third quarter while Carnival's earnings have been hovering around breakeven. If there's a downturn in the cruise industry, Carnival looks like it would be in a much weaker position than its peer."", ""Leverage can be very useful, especially in an industry that requires massive capital investments, like buying cruise ships. But leverage can also be very dangerous if a company finds itself facing a period of weak earnings. Simply put, Carnival's balance sheet was in much better shape prior to the pandemic than it is now. That means the business could be less resilient when the next headwind arrives. Leverage probably needs to come down a lot further before investors get more comfortable with Carnival."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Carnival Corp. wasn't one of them.

We appreciate you joining our call today. This morning, we reported full year 2023 earnings of $2 billion, reflecting record pretax pre-provision income of $3.2 billion and one of the best returns on average tangible common equity in our peer group at 22%. Our results speak to and underscore the comprehensive work that has taken place over the past decade to position the company to generate consistent, sustainable earnings regardless of the economic environment we're experiencing. We've enhanced our credit and interest rate risk management processes and platforms while sharpening our focus on risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation. Although the industry continues to face headwinds from lingering economic and geopolitical uncertainty as well as the continued evolution of the regulatory framework, we feel confident about our positioning and adaptability heading into 2024. We'll continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet, solid capital and liquidity and prudent credit risk management. Our proactive hedging strategies continue to position us for success in an array of economic conditions and our desirable footprint, granular deposit base and relationship banking approach will continue to serve us well. Our strategic plan continues to deliver consistent, sustainable long-term performance as we focus on soundness, profitability and growth. In closing, I'm excited to work alongside the 20,000 Regions associates who put customers and their needs at the center of all we do and focus on doing the right things the right way every day. Now Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter."", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans decreased modestly on a sequential quarter basis, while ending loans grew a little over 1% compared to the prior year. Within the business portfolio, average and ending loans declined 1% quarter-over-quarter. We are remaining judicious, reserving capital for business where we can have a full relationship. Loan demand remains soft as clients continue to exhibit cautious behavior. We are seeing clients make long-term investments when they have to, but if they can defer, they're holding off. In general, sentiment varies across industries with some continuing to expect growth, while others have a more muted outlook. Average and ending consumer loans remained relatively stable as growth in mortgage and EnerBank was partially offset by declines in home equity and the GreenSky exit portfolio sale we completed this quarter. Looking forward, we expect 2024 average loan growth to be in the low single digits. From a deposit standpoint, deposits increased modestly on an average and ending basis primarily due to increases in interest-bearing business products, which we expect will partially reverse with tax season in the first quarter. Across all 3 businesses, we continue to experience remixing from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits. However, the pace of remixing has slowed. Within Consumer, we continue to see balanced normalization, but we believe the pace of remixing will continue to slow as short-term market rates appear to have peaked and the relationship of checking balances to spending levels is getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. Our overall views on deposit balances and rates are unchanged. We expect incremental remixing out of low-cost savings and checking products of between $2 billion and $3 billion and total balances stabilizing by midyear. This results in a noninterest-bearing mix percentage remaining in the low 30% range. So let's shift to net interest income. Net interest income declined by approximately 4.5% in the quarter driven mostly by deposit cost and mix normalization as well as the start of the active period on $3 billion of incremental hedging. Asset yields benefited from the maturity and replacement of lower-yielding fixed rate loans and securities. Notably, during the quarter, we returned to full reinvestment of paydowns in the securities portfolio and added $500 million over and above that to the portfolio balance taking advantage of attractive market rate and spread levels. Interest-bearing deposit costs were 2.14% in the quarter, representing a 39% rising rate cycle beta. Growth in higher-cost corporate deposits increased our reported deposit betas by approximately 1%, but allowed for the termination of all outstanding FHLB advances. This and a more pronounced slowing in the pace of rate-seeking behavior by retail customers drove modest net interest income outperformance compared to expectations. As we look to 2024, we expect net interest income trends to stabilize over the first half of the year and grow over the back half of the year. $3 billion of additional forward starting hedges in the first quarter and further late-cycle deposit remixing will be a headwind. However, we expect deposit trends to continue to improve with interest-bearing betas peaking in the mid-40% range. The benefits of fixed rate asset turnover will persist, overcoming the headwinds and driving net interest income growth in the second half of the year. With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2024 net interest income to be between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. Our guidance assumes for 25 basis point rate cuts with long-term rates remaining stable from year-end. However, the path for net interest income is well insulated from changes in market interest rates. The primary driver of net interest income in 2024 will be deposit performance. The lower end of our expected 2024 net interest income range assumes a 25% beta as rates fall, while the higher end assumes a deposit beta similar to what we have experienced during the rising rate environment. In a falling rate environment, we are prepared to manage deposit costs lower to protect the margin. A relatively small portion of interest-bearing deposit balances is responsible for the majority of the deposit cost increase in the cycle. These market price deposits include index and other high beta corporate deposit types that will reprice immediately with Fed funds. The other primary contributor is CDs with a 7-month average maturity. While these products will lag in a falling rate environment, we are positioned to offset this cost. So let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 2% during the quarter as a sequential decline in capital markets was offset by modest increases in most other categories. Full year adjusted noninterest income declined 5%, primarily due to reductions in capital markets and mortgage income as well as the impact of the company's Overdraft Grace feature implemented late in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these declines were new records in 2023 for both treasury management and wealth management revenue. With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2024 adjusted noninterest income to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. Let's move on to noninterest expense. Reported noninterest expense increased 8% compared to the prior quarter but included 2 significant adjusted items. $119 million for the FDIC special assessment and $28 million in severance-related costs. Adjusted noninterest expense decreased 5%, driven primarily by lower operational losses. Full year adjusted noninterest expense increased 9.7% or approximately 6%, excluding elevated operational losses experienced primarily in the second and third quarters. We remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend. We expect full year 2024 adjusted noninterest expenses to be approximately $4.1 billion. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Reported annualized net charge-offs for the fourth quarter increased 14 basis points. However, excluding the impact of the GreenSky loan sale, adjusted net charge-offs decreased 1 basis point versus the prior quarter to 39 basis points. Full year adjusted net charge-offs were 37 basis points. Total nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased during the quarter. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 82 basis points due primarily to downgrade within industries previously identified as higher risk. Keep in mind, between 2013 and 2019, our average NPL ratio was 107 basis points. We expect to see further normalization towards these levels in 2024. Provision expense was $155 million or $23 million in excess of net charge-offs and includes an $8 million net provision expense related to the consumer loan sale. The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 3 basis points to 1.73% excluding the loan portfolio sold during the quarter, the allowance for credit loss ratio would have increased 6 basis points. The increase to our allowance was primarily due to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization as well as higher qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain higher risk portfolios. Our average net charge-offs from 2013 to 2019 were 46 basis points. We've seen modest acceleration towards these normalized levels in recent quarters. As a result, we expect our full year 2024 net charge-off ratio to be between 40 and 50 basis points. Turning to capital and liquidity. Given the evolution of the regulatory environment, we expect to maintain our common equity Tier 1 ratio around 10% over the near term. This level will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the proposed changes along the implementation time line while supporting strategic growth objectives and allow us to continue to increase the dividend commensurate with earnings. We ended the year with an estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.2%, while executing $252 million in share repurchases and $223 million in common dividends during the quarter. With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.', 'Robert Scott Siefers', ""Appreciate comments on the main levers for NII or within NII for your guidance. I was hoping if you could discuss a little more about the deposit repricing thoughts that you had. Maybe specifically thoughts about sort of the bifurcation between commercial and consumer deposits? And then just any opportunities you've seen with the Fed already having sort of peaked out presumably, any opportunities you've had already to maybe take some actions to ease the pressure on costs."", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Sure. Scott, this is David. One important thing to note is that about 30% of our customer base is really the driver of our interest-bearing deposit beta. If you look at that, little over half of that is related to our commercial book. And those deposits are indexed. So to the extent Fed changes rates those index data changes. So you're talking about rightfully 55%, almost 60% of that will come down as rates come down. The other represents consumer deposits. So these being CDs and money market accounts there where we've seen migration out of noninterest-bearing accounts. The money market piece, both of these have to be competitive. We have to watch what our competitors are doing to some degree. But we have mechanisms to really start working that down. Part of that is making sure we don't go too long on our CD maturities. So we've been fairly short. I think I mentioned in the prepared comments, our average CD term is 7 months. And so we don't want to extend that much going forward as a matter of we would like to0 shorten that. The coincide was what we think is going to happen with the Fed. Now we have 4 cuts baked in to our guidance -- to hit the midpoint of our guidance, which is on Page 6 of our presentation. And we think that starts probably at the May meeting. And we know that's different than what the market participants believe, but we think that, that's going to -- I think it's going to be slower versus faster. It's important to note, we're neutral to short-term rates. And so it's all about managing our deposit costs. And I think we have a good plan to do so. We've given you really a range. It's a pretty tight range on NII performance on the Page 6, and we kind of talk about betas. So if our betas kind of follow what we had and as rates have gone up, we're 39 a day. We said we'd probably finish in the mid-40s. If we have that coming back down, then we'll be at the upper end of our range if we're only at 25% beta as rates come down, knowing things won't match perfectly, then we'd be at the lower end of the range. So our midpoint is a 35% beta, which we think is very doable, in particular, relative to that half of that -- a little over half of that is related to index deposits on the commercial side."", 'Robert Scott Siefers', 'Perfect. And then maybe on the lending side. You noted soft client demand, which is very understandable. Just curious how you expect demand to trend as the year unfolds.', 'John M. Turner', 'Yes. Scott, this is John. I would -- our current projections are, we believe economic activity picks up towards the second half of the year and we believe we will experience some growth in core middle market banking and small business banking through our Ascentium platform, asset-based lending, which would be typical of this period of time. And on the consumer side, mortgage and EnerBank continue to contribute to growth. Again, any growth we have will be modest, and that will occur likely toward the back half of the year.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.', 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', 'Just maybe I wanted to follow up on the fee income guide. Maybe if you can dwell into where do you see growth across fee revenue, particularly what are you assuming in there to capital markets, was it weakish fourth quarter? So would love to hear outlook on capital market income within fees? And then do you expect to do more purchases for mortgage servicing rights as you did in the quarter? And should that boost mortgage income?', 'David Jackson Turner', ""Yes. So you -- it's David. So your first point on capital markets, we had a pretty tough capital markets finish in the fourth quarter. Been in that is timing. We think some deals, in particular, in the M&A world got pushed into the first quarter. The rate environment has really hampered our real estate corporate banking income line a bit. We think those rebound, both of those rebound, we think M&A has a tendency -- a chance to pick up probably towards the back half of the year actually, we've seen a little bit of rate relief if you will. So we have a pretty good feel about our capital markets rebound for 2024. Relative to mortgage servicing rights, as you know, we have good capital position. We look to support our business to grow our loan book. We think loan growth will be muted. So we look to other ways to put the capital to work, mortgage servicing rights has been one of those. We feel good about that asset class because we're good at it. We have a low-cost servicing group and we're looking to grow when packages make sense and the economics work to our advantage. There's been a number of those on the market. If we can hit the bid that we have to make sure we get an appropriate risk-adjusted return, we'll do that. We suspect there'll be a couple of opportunities during the year as they usually are. But we have room to grow that without adding a lot of fixed overhead to add people to do the servicing, but we don't have to add a lot of fixed overhead."", 'John M. Turner', ""Yes. I'd just add 2 things, Ebrahim. One is we continue to grow consumer checking accounts and consumer households that contributes to growth. Secondly, we had the best year we've probably ever had in treasury management as we see increases in the number of operating accounts that we're originating and services we're providing to customers. And then finally, Wealth Management had maybe the best year it's had certainly in some time, and we expect wealth management fee revenue to continue to grow in 2024."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""That's helpful. And just one other one, David. I guess the one flex on deposit pricing is your loan-to-deposit ratio at 77%, just give us a sense of is this steady state in somewhere in the mid- to high 70s where you see running the bank going forward? Or if rates get cut, you could see this ratio drift into the 80s and that probably provides you some pricing flexibility."", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Yes. So we really don't run the bank trying to solve for our loan deposit ratio. It's just kind of a result of all of our activities that we have. At 77% we're a little bit lower than the peer median by 2, 3 points. It gives us some flexibility to not have to put a lot of pressure on the deposit base. Remember, my opening comments where we want to be fair and balanced with regards to our customers, making sure that we were competitive but we don't have to push. We don't have to be at the upper end of pricing just to maintain those deposits. We have a good core deposit base and it gives us flexibility to not have to chase with rate. And that's why our deposit costs have tendency to be a bit lower across the board."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.', 'Manan Gosalia', ""I think you mentioned earlier on in the call that clients are deferring longer-term investments if they can. Can you talk about what's driving that? Is it just rates and they're waiting for rates to come down? Is part of it the environment and they need more certainty there? So any light on your conversations there would be helpful."", 'John M. Turner', ""Yes. I think probably all of the above, clearly, rising interest rates that have had some impact rising costs, cost of goods, cost of labor has had an impact. And then uncertainty related to the economy, geopolitical conditions, the political environment here in the U.S., all have, I think, created some restraint. Borrowers are, I believe, more optimistic today than they were 60 to 90 days ago, and that's in line with what appear to be improving economic conditions, but still reluctant to initiate long-term investments currently just based upon the things that I described."", 'Manan Gosalia', ""So as we think about deposit betas when rates go down, I think you and a number of your peers have suggested that okay, loan growth will accelerate as we get a resolution on some of these matters and as rates go down. But then on the flip side, does that mean that deposit competition picks back up? I'm just trying to assess the level of confidence on the high and low end of that range of that 25% to 45% down beta?"", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Well, we still think loan growth for the year is going to be relatively muted. And competition for deposits has always been fairly intense. Which you don't want to have to do is use rate. You want to have a relationship banking model, which is what we do. We leverage off of the checking account of the consumer and an operating account of a business. And with that comes all of the type of funding. For us, we have no wholesale borrowings to speak of, paid off all of our FHLB advances. So we have the ability to lever up there to cover incremental growth without having to reprice our deposit base. So if there's incremental pressure or competition on deposits, I don't think it will be all that meaningful for us in particular."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.', 'Ryan Matthew Nash', ""Maybe a question on capital. David, in the slides, you talked about maintaining 10%, your over 8% on an adjusted basis. Maybe just talk about how you think about uses of capital outside of loan growth. I know we had some buyback this quarter. I think in December, we were talking about the potential for securities portfolio restructuring. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about incremental uses of capital from here."", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Yes. So obviously, let me just go through the kind of checkpoints as we think about it. So we want to use our capital to support loan growth. It's going to be fairly muted. As I mentioned, we want to pay a fair dividend, 35% to 45% of our earnings. So we think that's covered. We then have excess capital that we look to put to work in growing our business. We've looked at more searching rights, as I mentioned just a couple of calls ago. And we'll continue to look for businesses that we think can help us grow. We have talked about the securities repositioning. We continue to evaluate that. We have not made any decisions to do that just yet. And outside of that, we don't want our capital to get too far away from 10%. And the 10% is pegged on the fact that we think we're close enough with our ability to accrete capital every quarter to adapt to whatever the regulatory environment is going to be. There's a lot of uncertainty with regards to what that's going to look like, and there's no need for us to continue to ramp up capital to an unnecessary level and hurt our return, we think we're in an optimal spot to be able to maneuver and so we think the 10% number is the right thing to do -- the right place to be."", 'Ryan Matthew Nash', ""Got it. Maybe to come at net interest income and net interest margin from a little bit of a different perspective. You gave us guidance for the first quarter and NIM is expected to be around 350 for the full year. Maybe David, you were daring. Talk about how you see it evolving over the course of the year end. When you look out as we think about the declining rate cycle, where do you foresee the net interest margin settling out over time? I know historically, we've talked about a 3.6% to 4% range. Maybe just a little bit of color on where you see it settling out over the course of the next couple of years."", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Yes. So I think you're going to see that margin pressure a little bit in the first quarter and slightly in the second quarter. The first quarter has another, call it, $3 billion of received fixed swaps that will become effective that will have some negative carry that hurts us a bit in the first quarter. And then things start to change a bit beginning in the second quarter so literally, like after the first month. So I think you'll see a little bit more of a movement in the first quarter and a tiny movement in second. And then we can start to rebound a bit where we'll finish. We think for the year in the 3.50% range, I think as things settle down, we had talked about 3.60% to 4%. That 3.60% was predicated on rates really going back down to very low levels, and that's the purpose of our whole hedging strategy is because we have lower deposit costs of most everybody. If we're going to protect our margin, we have to do it synthetically. And so we have about $20 billion in any given year of received fixed swaps and some other derivatives to help us manage the net interest margin in the 3.60% to 4% range. So you're likely over time to be kind of in the middle of that. And we think that that's a possibility in time that things have to settle out. We've got to get deposit costs back to tie up with where rates are. But we can probably exit the year in the 3.60% range."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.', 'John G. Pancari', 'On the operating leverage side, I mean, your guidance implies negative operating leverage unsurprisingly for 2024. But as you look at your trajectory on the revenue front, your assumptions there combined with your expense expectations, how do you view the likelihood of achieving positive operating leverage in 2025. And when do you expect that you could break into a more positive trajectory on a quarterly basis.', 'David Jackson Turner', ""So I have a tendency to look at it on an annual basis. And you're right, we can't generate positive operating leverage in '24, primarily because of our outperformance in the first 2 quarters of '23, where we were having above 4% margin, which is way above most everybody. And so I think that's been acknowledged in the marketplace. I do think we can get back at '25 to generate positive operating leverage, and we'll start trending there towards the back half of the year as we see us bottoming out in terms of net interest income and margin in the second quarter, and then we can start to grow from there. We'll see what the economy looks like. We'll see what loan growth looks like. We think that picks up a bit. And we think the pressure on deposit betas start to go the other way. And as I just mentioned, we can exit with a little stronger margin. So I think positive operating leverage towards the back half is a possibility."", 'John M. Turner', 'And definitely for 2025.', 'David Jackson Turner', ""And we're going to get there for 2025."", 'John G. Pancari', ""Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then secondly, around credit. Regarding the NPA increase, I know you've flagged the downgrade -- the risk rating downgrades and some of the higher risk sectors. Maybe can you give us a little bit more color whether -- was it concentrated in any one sector? Was there a broader scrub of the loan book that you completed that led you to the multiple of the -- multiple downgrades? Or is it just episodic and then, I guess, just separately, can you talk about the reserve? I know you built it a bit here. What's the outlook there if you continue to add from here?"", 'John M. Turner', ""I'd just say, John, with respect to the increase in NPLs, we've called out portfolios that have been under some stress for a number of quarters now. What we saw in the quarter was some migration from criticized classified to nonperforming, specifically in senior housing, in transportation and warehousing, transportation, specifically and office and then additionally, manufacturing of consumer discretionary items. So that is and that was our expectation. We have 1 large technology credit that moved in the third quarter. That is episodic, we believe, is something that we can and believe we will manage through. So when you look at the migration, as we pointed out, we are moving back to more traditional sort of historical levels of nonperforming loans, which is somewhere between 80 and 100 to 110 basis points. I think maybe David said the average was 102 or 106, 107 from '14 to '19. And we've guided to 40 to 50 basis points of charge-offs, which we think is in line with our expectations for potential loss in the portfolio over time. So I think we feel we have good insight into the credits that we're managing as to why, I would say the burden of increasing interest rates, increasing cost, cost of labor, operating costs, all those things have had an impact specifically on the industries that we've historically now called out transportation, senior housing, office, consumer discretionary. Now with respect to the allowance, we have a process we follow and go through every quarter. And I think we believe -- we currently believe, obviously, that we've provided for potential losses in the portfolio over time, unless we experienced growth in the portfolio or paydowns in the portfolio, some changes in outstandings in the portfolio or in economic conditions. You can assume that our allowance is appropriate and likely won't change -- the trajectory of it will not change unless the economy changes."", 'David Jackson Turner', 'And the only other thing, John, on that would be if the risk ratings change, that go up or down, that also impacts your provisioning or release reserves. So I add that point with other 2 or 3 that John mentioned.', 'John G. Pancari', ""And David, I'm sorry, if I could just add regarding that last point, if the risk rating migration negatively assume -- is it now assumed as part of your outlook, just given where we are in this downturn?"", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Yes, that's right. You look at your reasonable and forecast period and think about where the credits are going; if that changes, so to go the other way, that can cause you not to have to provide any more. So we provided what we think we need to have. If things get better, then you don't need the reserves that you put up and you can release those reserves. If things get worse, then you have to provide more. Generally, loan growth is also a driver of having to add to the provision. If your loans are going the other way, then you don't need the reserves that you had set up for them, so you can have a release related to that. Economic conditions got a little better in the fourth quarter than the third. So that was a positive. But net-net, we're continuing to look at the life of the loan and where that's going to go, and we think we have appropriate reserves for losses that are there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point.', 'David Patrick Rochester', ""On the NII guide, I was just wondering how Slide 6 might change if we don't get those cuts you're factoring in for the year. I know you mentioned you're neutral to those, so maybe this range wouldn't change much. Just figured that might change some of the deposit flow and beta assumptions in here and maybe some other stuff."", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Yes. So we tried to put that in. If you look at the lower box, on the lower end of that, we say stable, that was trying to address exactly what your question is. So to the extent that we're kind of where we are."", 'David Patrick Rochester', 'That was all within this range.', 'David Jackson Turner', ""That's right. That's right."", 'David Patrick Rochester', 'But the lower end?', 'David Jackson Turner', 'Yes.', 'David Patrick Rochester', ""Got you. And then for the $12 billion to $14 billion in the fixed rate loan production and securities investment you mentioned per year. I was just curious what the breakdown of that was for securities and loans and what yields you're putting on today on both the securities investment and new loan production, just on average? I know you've got many different categories and loans you're producing."", 'David Jackson Turner', 'So I think in total, the kind of the front book back book between those 2 is about 200, 250 basis points of pickup. If you look at that 12 to 15, about 1/4 of that is related to securities. That going on as front book, back book pieces of, call it, 300 basis points in loans, front book back book of probably in the 150 to 200 range.', 'David Patrick Rochester', ""Okay. Great. And then just on capital, given your comments on 10% CET1 targeting that unadjusted. What does that mean for the pace of buybacks here? Is the fourth quarter pace a good one going forward for the next few quarters maybe? And then as it relates to your adjusted CET1 ratio, which is just over 8% you've got here, how are you thinking about where you want that to be over time as the new regs kick in?"", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Well, one, we don't know what the new rules are going to be. So we fully loaded it with A2 to show you that, that doesn't impact our stress capital buffer or our absolute minimum. We're in good shape there. We just need to see where the rules come out. By the time all that happens, AOCI is going to be in a different spot than it is today, assuming rates continue to come down a bit. We saw a pretty big move in all of the peers with AOCI this quarter. From a capital standpoint, we think 10% is the right number -- what was?"", 'Unidentified Company Representative', 'Buyback pace.', 'David Jackson Turner', ""The buyback pace. So again, we used the buyback as our last mechanism to help us keep our common equity Tier 1 in that 10% range. And so the pace is do your favorite earnings expectation take out the dividend, use a bit of that with low single-digit loan growth and then the rest is either going to be buying mortgage servicing rights or things of that nature, and then we toggle with share repurchases. So I don't want to comment on whether we stay on the pace because they end up getting your earnings guidance. That's a trick."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.', 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""David, can you share with us, you guys have given us good detail on credit quality and John, you pointed out that the nonperforming loan increase was to the sectors of your portfolio that you've already identified as being weak. Could we look at it another way, and you give us good details on Slides 27 and 28 on the leveraged portfolio in the Shared National Credit portfolio, how are those portfolios holding up credit-wise? And when you think back to where we were a year ago, I remember many of the calls, the word recession was used quite often in those calls, we're not hearing that on this fourth quarter earnings call for most or nearly all the banks. So have these portfolios held up better than what you would have thought it from a year ago?"", 'John M. Turner', ""I would say, yes, Gerard. The leverage portfolio is largely relationship-based credit business. Those are banking relationships that we enjoy, we're close to those customers and we've been close to them throughout this period of elevated rates. There was some risk as rates rose, that we had -- that there may be some softness in the portfolio, but I think it's performed well. The same is true of our Shared National Credit book. And we began to build a capital markets business to help us grow and diversify our revenue and to meet more customer needs. We naturally then began to expand the size of our Shared National Credit book so that we could serve those customers that had need for those products and services. And with that, as you can imagine, comes some tall free risk, single name risk and while I mentioned earlier, we have a technology credit that's fairly substantial. That's an NPL. That is an example of Shared National Credit exposure that we have good visibility into. We think has very limited risk of loss but still as a nonperforming loan. But overall, I would say, just based upon the reflection on the performance of that book, it's been good. We've enjoyed expanding relationships, growing revenue from capital markets and/or deposits, treasury management that we enjoy with those customers. And so I think we've been pleased with the performance of both the leverage book and the Shared National Credit book."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Very good. And then coming back to loans, I think, David, in your comments, you talked about loan demand remains soft and you're looking for low single-digit growth for average loans in 2024. I know during our careers, the shadow banking industry has continued its competition against the banks, but it seems today, there's more coverage of the private equity side getting into lending maybe greater than what we've seen in years, how are you guys competing against the private credit markets. And at the same time, are any of those private credit lenders, customers of yours that you have to balance that relationship of a customer competing against you."", 'John M. Turner', ""We have very modest exposure to private equity who then is -- we're not lending private equity to, in turn, lend into our customer base. So if we have any exposure, it would be very modest there. Separately, we don't see private equity as a competitor necessarily within our core middle market customer base. I asked Ronnie Smith the question the other day if he could name a customer that we lost to private credit. And we can't think of one. Now it doesn't mean it's not occurring in some of the markets that we're in. But by and large, given our focus on the core middle market business and investment-grade type Shared National Credit exposure, we're just not -- we're not seeing private credit as a competitor today. On the wholesale side now there are lots of competitors on the consumer side that we're seeing in a variety of different ways, including mortgage and home improvement that we compete with."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', 'Which are nontraditional depositories?', 'John M. Turner', ""Yes. That's right."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Spahr with Wells Fargo. Christopher Spahr, your line is live. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon King with Truist.', 'Brandon Thomas King', ""So I appreciate the guidance on expenses and expense control there. But I did have a question on just an update on the technology modernization project and kind of what you're baking in for expenses in 2024? And if part of that other expense savings is related to maybe delaying some of that project into further years."", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Yes, Brandon. So we've given you our overall expense guide to be essentially flat after you carve out operational losses from the past year. We continue to make investments in our business. We call it R2, which is our transformation project in cyber and risk management, consumer compliance, a lot of investment in areas of the bank that we're looking to offset elsewhere. R2 project has come along very well. We spent anywhere depending on the year, 9% to 11% of our revenue in terms of technology costs. We don't expect that to change materially in the short term. We continue to evaluate how we can better leverage technology and I think we have a lot of upside potential to leverage that in our business to continue to improve and to continue to take out manual steps, manual processes and have a technology solution too. So we think our investment in technology is the right thing to do and we're going to have a modern core deposit platform in the not-too-distant future, which we think will be a competitive advantage for us as well. So anyway, that's kind of a spending range, if you will, 9% to 11% for revenue."", 'Brandon Thomas King', 'Okay. And just no delays in the timing of that?', 'John M. Turner', 'Yes. No. Yes. To answer your question specifically, that project is on time and on budget, no delays.', 'Brandon Thomas King', 'And then just had a follow-up on credit, and particularly in senior housing. Just wanted to get more details as far as your exposure there? And what are you thinking as far as ultimate loss content, insufficient from a credit loss [space].', 'John M. Turner', ""Yes. We're seeing improvement in the senior housing space, notwithstanding the fact that we have a couple of credits we're carrying as nonperforming. Generally occupancy rates are improving over time. Today, we've got about $63 million in -- I'm sorry, $57 million in -- $118 million in nonperforming loans and reserves against those credits of about 3.7%. So I think we've maybe provided information on Slide 20 in our deck. But we are seeing improvement in senior housing as occupancy rates pick up and people become a little more comfortable with communal living again amongst that age group."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.', 'Erika Najarian', ""Good morning. One follow-up question, Dave. I think very notable what you said to Ryan's line of questioning, the 3.6% exit rate for the net interest margin in the fourth quarter. A lot of investors are now focused on that exit rate. So I'm just wondering if I could ask you sort of what the component pieces is or are rather. So unless you've changed anything on the -- in terms of adding swaps, it seems like you do have $1.6 billion of notional rolling off in the fourth quarter. So I guess it's a good guy. You also mentioned a terminated swap gain in your 10-Q, but you had like a forward look for 4 quarters. Wondering what that could be for 4Q '24 and then more notably, obviously, you guys have said unequivocally that it's the deposit assumption that's really going to make a difference. I'm wondering sort of what the speed is that you're assuming on that 35% down beta, especially if you think of the first rate cut, I think you said was in May."", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Yes. So I think all in, the big drivers there are controlling the deposit costs. We do have a headwind of the $3 billion notional for starting swap in the first quarter and then we're kind of in the run rate that the terminated swaps are in the amortization already. Those aren't huge drivers. I think after we get our headwind and if rates start to come down, then, like I said, almost 60% of our beta is associated with index deposits on the commercial side. So they'll start to come down. And you start then having the loan and security repricing, the fixed maturity repricing, adding 200, 250 basis points that overwhelms that headwind towards the back end of the year and you get a little bit of loan growth in the back end. All that helps you propel you to a much stronger fourth quarter finish than you have at the beginning of the year. So I think if you really looked at what is the one big thing that you have to get done and it's controlling the deposit cost, and we do that through managing the beta as rates change, like I said, 55%, 60% of an index. The other is decisioning we have to make. And that gets to be a little herky jerky because, as I mentioned, some of that's money market that we can change pretty quickly. The other CDs that were locked in today, it's 7 months. And as things renew this month, next month and going forward, we're looking to be shorter rather than longer so that we are prepared to take advantage to reduce our deposit costs as rates come down."", 'Erika Najarian', ""And a follow-up to that, you mentioned 55% to 60% of that down rate coming from these indexed commercial deposits. One of your peers made a differentiation between indexed and contractual yesterday. And I guess just give us some sense of how much of that is contracted versus index? And but really, it sounds like you're confident that either way, you can control that to the downside, especially as you said, loan growth remained soft this year."", 'David Jackson Turner', ""Yes. So when we say index, we're talking about it's tied to Fed fund; when Fed funds changes through the contract, it changes automatically. There's no -- it's not a contractual number locked in like effectively as CD. It's the day -- just like a loan that's based on SOFR. I mean, SOFR changes, so does loan rate that day. And so that's what we're talking about when we say index deposits."", 'Operator', ""Our final question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", 'Any updated thoughts on potential regulatory changes to the debit card interchange fee or overdraft fees and thinking about potential [all cuts] to that.', 'David Jackson Turner', ""Well, so debit interchange going through a discussion to adjust that down. So it was written in the original law and they had to revisit the costs associated with debit interchange. To the extent that does get put into place, that will have a negative impact to us starting, I think that was going to be kicking in, in June. So it's about half a year. And based on our numbers, that's about a $45 million risk item to us in our NIR. Relative to the overdrafts, we're a long way from knowing where that comes out, if there are any changes, and I think 2025 date that we mentioned, that just hit the wire. I think there's going to be a lot of discussion on that because we're disappointed in that we think provision of liquidity to our customer base is really, really important. We do charge a fee for that, but we're paying an item for somebody and charging a fee. And to the extent we return that item to wherever it was written or used, that entity is going to charge a fee. And so it doesn't -- it's not helpful to not be able to provide liquidity to our customer base. And so we're hoping there's going to be further discussion on that point. And I think it would be premature to really talk about the impact of OD until we get further down the road."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", ""Okay. And then just separately, good to see the elevated check fraud came down as you expected and the outlook kind of implies but you're confident that you're past this issue. I guess, just wanted to reconfirm that. And then also just any meaningful changes that you made to address it and whether it showed up in expenses overall?"", 'John M. Turner', 'I would just say that the countermeasures that we put in place, which include talent, technology, process changes, all have been effective. And we believe going forward, the run rate will be $20 million to $25 million per quarter in operating losses and the expenses associated with those countermeasures are embedded in our run rate and in our projection for expenses for 2024.', 'David Jackson Turner', ""We got to continue to be vigilant with regards to this, just like we are with cyber. So we have bad people attacking us as does every financial institution, and we have to continue to stay ahead of it. We feel good about what we put in place, but we are not sitting idle. We're continuing to push and challenge ourselves to get even better than we are today."", 'John M. Turner', 'Okay. Operator, is that the end of the call?', 'Operator', 'Yes. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.', 'John M. Turner', ""Okay. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate everybody's participation today and interest in our company. Have a good weekend."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.""]"

Welcome to Regions' fourth quarter 2023 earnings Call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding our results.

The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.', 'See the 10 stocks', '*Stock Advisor returns as of January 16, 2024', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. This morning, we reported full year 2023 earnings of $2 billion, reflecting record pre-tax pre-provision income of $3.2 billion, and one of the best returns on average tangible common equity in our peer group at 22%. Our results speak to and underscore the comprehensive work that has taken place over the past decade to position the company to generate consistent, sustainable earnings regardless of the economic environment we're experiencing."", ""We've enhanced our credit and interest rate risk management processes and platforms while sharpening our focus on risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation. Although the industry continues to face headwinds from lingering economic and geopolitical uncertainty, as well as the continued evolution of the regulatory framework, we feel confident about our positioning and adaptability heading into 2024. We'll continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet, solid capital and liquidity, and prudent credit risk management. Our proactive hedging strategies continue to position us for success in an array of economic conditions."", ""And our desirable footprint, granular deposit base, and relationship banking approach will continue to serve us well. Our strategic plan continues to deliver consistent, sustainable, long-term performance as we focus on soundness, profitability, and growth. In closing, I'm excited to work alongside the 20,000 Regions associates to put customers and their needs at the center of all we do and focus on doing the right things the right way every day. Now, Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter."", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans decreased modestly on a sequential-quarter basis, while ending loans grew a little over 1% compared to the prior year. Within the business portfolio, average and ending loans declined 1% quarter over quarter."", ""We are remaining judicious reserving capital for business where we can have a full relationship. Loan demand remains soft as clients continue to exhibit cautious behavior. We are seeing clients make long-term investments when they have to, but if they can defer, they're holding off. In general, sentiment varies across industries, with some continuing to expect growth, while others have a more muted outlook."", 'Average and ending consumer loans remained relatively stable as growth in mortgage and EnerBank was partially offset by declines in home equity and the GreenSky exit portfolio sale we completed this quarter. Looking forward, we expect 2024 average loan growth to be in the low single digits. From a deposit standpoint, deposits increased modestly on an average and ending basis, primarily due to increases in interest-bearing business products, which we expect will partially reverse with tax season in the first quarter. Across all three businesses, we continue to experience remixing from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits.', 'However, the pace of remixing has slowed. Within consumer, we continue to see balance normalization, but we believe the pace of remixing will continue to slow as short-term market rates appear to have peaked and the relationship of checking balances to spending levels is getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. Our overall views on deposit balances and rates are unchanged. We expect incremental remixing out of low-cost savings and checking products of between $2 billion and $3 billion and total balances stabilizing by mid-year.', ""This results in a noninterest-bearing mix percentage remaining in the low 30% range. So, let's shift in net interest income. Net interest income declined by approximately 4.5% in the quarter, driven mostly by deposit cost and mix normalization, as well as the start of the active period on $3 billion of incremental hedging. Asset yields benefited from the maturity and replacement of lower-yielding fixed-rate loans and securities."", 'Notably, during the quarter, we returned to full reinvestment of paydowns in the securities portfolio and added $500 million over and above that to the portfolio balance, taking advantage of attractive market rate and spread levels. Interest-bearing deposit costs were 2.14% in the quarter, representing a 39% rising rate cycle beta. Growth in higher-cost corporate deposits increased our reported deposit betas by approximately 1% but allowed for the termination of all outstanding FHLB advances. This and a more pronounced slowing in the pace of rate-seeking behavior by retail customers drove modest net interest income outperformance compared to expectations.', 'As we look to 2024, we expect net interest income trends to stabilize over the first half of the year and grow over the back half of the year. Three billion dollars of additional forward starting hedges in the first quarter and further late-cycle deposit remixing will be a headwind. However, we expect deposit trends to continue to improve, with interest-bearing betas peaking in the mid-40% range. The benefits of fixed-rate asset turnover will persist, overcoming the headwinds and driving net interest income growth in the second half of the year.', 'With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2024 net interest income to be between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. Our guidance assumes four 25-basis-point rate cuts, with long-term rates remaining stable from year-end. However, the path for net interest income is well insulated from changes in market interest rates. The primary driver of net interest income in 2024 will be deposit performance.', 'The lower end of our expected 2024 net interest income range assumes that 25% beta as rates fall, while the higher end assumes a deposit beta similar to what we have experienced during the rising rate environment. In a falling rate environment, we are prepared to manage deposit costs lower to protect the margin. A relatively small portion of interest-bearing deposit balances is responsible for the majority of the deposit cost increase this cycle. These market price deposits include index and other high beta corporate deposit types that will reprice immediately with fed funds.', ""The other primary contributor is CDs, with a seven-month average maturity. While these products will lag in a falling rate environment, we are positioned to offset this cost. So, let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 2% during the quarter as a sequential decline in capital markets was offset by modest increases in most other categories."", ""Full year adjusted noninterest income declined 5%, primarily due to reductions in capital markets and mortgage income, as well as the impact of the company's Overdraft Grace feature implemented late in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these declines were new records in 2023 for both treasury management and wealth management revenue. With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2024 adjusted noninterest income to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. Let's move on to noninterest expense."", 'Reported noninterest expense increased 8% compared to the prior quarter, but included two significant adjusted items: $119 million for the FDIC special assessment and $28 million in severance-related costs. Adjusted noninterest expense decreased 5%, driven primarily by lower operational losses. Full year adjusted noninterest expense increased 9.7% or approximately 6% excluding elevated operational losses experienced primarily in the second and third quarters. We remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business.', 'We will continue focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy, and vendor spend. We expect full year 2024 adjusted noninterest expenses to be approximately $4.1 billion. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Reported annualized net charge-offs for the fourth quarter increased 14 basis points.', 'However, excluding the impact of the GreenSky loan sale, adjusted net charge-offs decreased 1 basis point versus the prior quarter to 39 basis points. Full year adjusted net charge-offs were 37 basis points. Total nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased during the quarter. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 82 basis points due primarily to downgrades within industries previously identified as higher risk.', 'Keep in mind, between 2013 and 2019, our average NPL ratio was 107 basis points. We expect to see further normalization toward these levels in 2024. Provision expense was $155 million, or $23 million in excess of net charge-offs, and includes an $8 million net provision expense related to the consumer loan sale. The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 3 basis points to 1.73%.', ""Excluding the loan portfolio sold during the quarter, the allowance for credit loss ratio would have increased 6 basis points. The increase to our allowance was primarily due to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization, as well as higher qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain higher-risk portfolios. Our average net charge-offs from 2013 to 2019 were 46 basis points. We've seen modest acceleration toward these normalized levels in recent quarters."", 'As a result, we expect our full year 2024 net charge-off ratio to be between 40 basis points and 50 basis points. Turning to capital and liquidity. Given the evolution of the regulatory environment, we expect to maintain our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio around 10% over the near term. This level will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the proposed changes along the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allow us to continue to increase the dividend, commensurate with earnings.', ""We ended the year with an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.2% while executing $252 million in share repurchases and $223 million in common dividends during the quarter. With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.', 'Scott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Excuse me. Appreciate the comments on the main levers for NII -- or within NII for your guidance.', ""I was hoping you could discuss a little more about the deposit repricing thoughts that you had. You know, maybe specifically thoughts about sort of the bifurcation between commercial and consumer deposits. And then just any opportunities you've seen with the fed already having sort of peaked out, presumably. Any opportunities you've had already to, you know, maybe take some actions to ease the pressure on costs?"", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Scott, it's David. One important thing to note is that about 30% of our customer base is really the driver of our interest-bearing deposit beta. If you look at that, a little over half of that is related to our commercial book, and those deposits are indexed."", ""So, to the extent fed changes rates, those index to beta changes. So, you're talking about roughly 55%, almost 60% of that will come down as rates come down. The other represents consumer deposits. So, these have been CDs and money market accounts there where we've seen migration out of noninterest-bearing accounts."", ""The money market piece -- both of these have to be competitive. We have to watch what our competitors are doing to some degree. But we have mechanisms to really start working that down. Part of that is making sure we don't go too long on our CD maturity."", ""So, we've been fairly short. I think I mentioned in the prepared comments, our average CD term is seven months. And so, we don't want to extend that much going forward. As a matter of fact, we'd like to shorten that to coincide with what we think is going to happen with the fed, and we have four cuts baked into our guidance to hit the midpoint of our guidance, which is on Page 6 of our presentation."", ""And we think that starts probably at the May meeting. And we know that's different than what the market participants believe, but we think that that's going to -- I think it's going to be slower versus faster. It's important to note, we're neutral to short-term rates. And so, it's all about managing our deposit costs, and I think we have a good plan to do so."", ""We've given you, really, a range. It's a pretty tight range on NII performance on the Page 6. And we kind of talk about betas. So, you know, if our betas kind of follow what we had and as rates have gone up, we're at 39 today."", ""We said we'd probably finish in the mid-40s. If we have that coming back down, then we'll be at the upper end of our range. If we're only at 25% beta as rates come down, knowing things won't match perfectly, then we'd be at the lower end of the range. So, our midpoint is a 35% beta, which we think is very doable."", 'In particular, relative to that, half of that -- a little over half of that is related to index deposits on the commercial side.', 'Scott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Perfect. Thanks for that color, David. And then maybe on the lending side, you noted soft side demand, which is very understandable. Just curious how you expect demand to trend as the year unfolds.', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Scott, this is John. I would -- you know, our current projections are we believe economic activity picks up toward the second half of the year and we believe we will experience some growth in core middle market banking and small business banking through our [Inaudible] platform asset-based lending, which would be typical of this period of time. And then on the consumer side, mortgage and EnerBank continue to contribute to growth.', 'Again, any growth we have will be modest, and that will occur likely toward the back half of the year.', 'Scott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Yup. Perfect. All right. Thank you all very much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Hey. Good morning. Just maybe I wanted to follow up on the fee income guide, maybe if we can drill into where do you see growth across fee revenue. Particularly, what are you assuming in there for capital markets? It was a weak-ish fourth quarter, so we'd love to hear the outlook on capital markets income within fees."", 'And then do you expect to do more purchases for mortgage servicing rights, as you did in the quarter, and should that boost mortgage income? Thank you.', 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, your -- it's David. So, your first point on capital markets, you know, we had a pretty tough capital markets finish in the fourth quarter. A bit of that is timing."", ""We think some deals, in particular in the M&A world, got pushed into the first quarter. You know, the rate environment has really hampered our real estate corporate banking income line a bit. We think those rebound -- both of those rebound. We think M&A can -- has a tendency -- a chance to pick up probably toward the back half of the year after we've seen a little bit of rate relief if you will."", 'So, you know, we have a pretty good feel about our capital markets rebound for 2024. Relative to mortgage servicing rights, as you know, we have a good capital position. We look to support our business to grow our loan book. We think loan growth will be muted, so we look to other ways to put the capital to work.', ""Mortgage servicing rights has been one of those. We feel good about that asset class because we're good at it. We're at a low-cost servicing group, and we're looking to grow when packages make sense and the economics work to our advantage. There have been a number of those on the market."", ""You know, if they -- if we can hit the bid that we have to make sure we get an appropriate risk-adjusted return, we'll do that. We suspect there'll be a couple of opportunities during the year, as there usually are. But we have room to grow that without adding a lot of fixed overhead. Have to add people to do the servicing, but we don't have to add a lot of fixed overhead."", 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I'd just add two things, Ebrahim. One is we continue to grow consumer checking accounts and consumer households. That contributes to growth. Secondly, we had the best year we've probably ever had in treasury management as we see increases in the number of operating accounts that we are -- that we're originating and services we're providing to customers."", ""And finally, wealth management had maybe the best year it's had, certainly in some time, and we expect wealth management fee revenue to continue to grow in 2024."", 'Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""That's helpful. And just one other one, David. I guess the one flex on deposit pricing is your loan-to-deposit ratio at 77. Just give us a sense of is this steady state and somewhere in the mid to high 70s where you see running the bank going forward."", 'Or if rates get cut, you could see this ratio drift into the 80s, and that probably provides you some pricing flexibility. Thank you.', 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, we really don't run the bank trying to solve for our loan deposit ratio. It's just kind of a result of all of our activities that we have. You know, at 77%, we're a little bit lower than the peer median by 2 points or 3 points."", ""It gives us some flexibility to not have to put a lot of pressure on the deposit base. Remember, my opening comments were we want to be fair and balanced with regards to our customers, making sure that we -- we're competitive. But we don't have to push. We don't have to be at the upper end of pricing just to maintain those deposits."", ""We have a good core deposit base, and it gives us flexibility to not have to chase with rate. And that's why our deposit costs have a tendency to bend, be a bit lower across the board."", 'Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.', 'Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Hi. Good morning. You know, I think you mentioned earlier on in the call that clients are deferring longer-term investments if they can. Can you talk about what's driving that? Is it just rates and they're waiting for rates to come down? Is part of it the environment and they need more certainty there? So, any light on your conversations, that would be helpful."", 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. I think probably all of the above. Clearly, rising interest rates, that have had some impact. Rising cost, cost of goods, cost of labor has had an impact.', ""And then uncertainty related to the economy, geopolitical conditions, the political environment here in the U.S. all have, I think, created some restraint. Borrowers are, I believe, more optimistic today than they were 60 to 90 days ago, and that's in line with what appear to be improving economic conditions, but still reluctant to initiate long-term investments currently just based upon the things that I described."", 'Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""So, as we think about deposit betas when rates go down, you know, I think you and a number of your peers have suggested that, OK, loan growth will accelerate as we get a resolution in some of these matters and as rates go down. But then on the flip side, does that mean that deposit competition picks back up? You know, I'm just trying to assess the level of confidence on the high end, low end of that range of that 25% to 45% down beta."", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, we still think loan growth for the year is going to be relatively muted. And, you know, we've -- competition for deposits has always been fairly intense. You know, what you don't want to have -- do is use rate. You want to have a relationship banking model, which is what we do."", 'We leverage off of the checking account of the consumer and an operating account of a business, and with that comes all of the type of funding. You know, for us, we have no wholesale borrowings to speak of. We paid off all of our FHLB advances. So, we have the ability to lever up there to cover incremental growth without having to reprice our deposit base.', ""So, if there's incremental pressure or competition on deposit, I don't think it'll be all that meaningful for us in particular."", 'Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Ryan.', 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Ryan Nash -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, John. Good morning, David. Maybe a question on capital.', 'David, in the slides, you talked about maintaining 10% year over -- 8% on an adjusted basis. Maybe just talk about how you think about uses of capital outside of loan growth. I know we had some buyback this quarter. I think, in December, we were talking about the potential for securities portfolio restructuring.', 'Maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about incremental uses of capital from here.', 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, obviously, let me just go through the kind of checkpoints as we think about it. So, we want to use our capital to support loan growth. It's going to be fairly muted, as I mentioned."", ""We want to pay a fair dividend, 35% to 45% of our earnings. So, we think that's covered. We then have excess capital that we look to put to work in growing our business. We've looked at mortgage servicing rights, as I mentioned just a couple of calls ago."", ""And we'll continue to look for businesses that we think can help us grow. We have talked about the securities repositioning. We continue to evaluate that. We have not made any decisions to do that just yet."", ""And, you know, outside of that, we don't want our capital to get too far away from 10%, and the 10% is pegged on the fact that we think we're close enough with our ability to accrete capital every quarter to adapt to whatever the regulatory environment is going to be. There's a lot of uncertainty with regards to what that's going to look like. And there's no need for us to continue to ramp up capital to an unnecessary level and hurt our return. We think we're in an optimal spot to be able to maneuver, and so we think the 10% number is the right thing to do -- the right place to be."", 'Ryan Nash -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Got it. Maybe to come at net interest income and net interest margin from a little bit of a different perspective. You know, you gave us guidance for the first quarter, and NIM is expected to be around 3.50 for the full year. Maybe, David, you or Deron can talk about how you see it evolving over the course of the year.', ""And, you know, when you look out as we think about, you know, the declining rate cycle, where do you foresee the net interest margin settling out over time? I know, historically, we've talked about a 3.6% to 4% range. Maybe just a little bit of color on, you know, where you see it settling out over the course of the next couple of years. Thank you."", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, I think you're going to see that margin pressure in the -- a little bit in the first quarter and slightly in the second quarter. The first quarter has another, call it, $3 billion of received fixed swaps. It'll become effective."", ""That'll have some negative carry that hurts us a bit in the first quarter. And then, you know, things start to change a bit beginning in the second quarter, so literally like after the first month. So, I think you'll see a little bit more of a movement in the first quarter and a tiny movement in the second. And then we can start to rebound a bit where we'll finish, we think, you know, for the year in the 3.50 range."", ""I think as things settled down, we had talked about 3.60% to 4%. That 3.60 was predicated on rates really going back down to very low levels. And that's -- the purpose of our whole hedging strategy is because we have lower deposit costs than most everybody, if we're going to protect our margin, we have to do it synthetically. And so, we have about $20 billion in any given year of received fixed swaps and some other derivatives to help us manage the net interest margin in the 3.60% to 4% range."", ""So, we're likely, over time, to be, you know, kind of in the middle of that, and we think that that's a possibility in time that things have to settle out and we've got to get deposit costs back to tie up with where rates are. But we can probably exit the year in the 3.60 range."", 'Ryan Nash -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thanks for all the color, David.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Good morning. On the operating leverage side, I mean, your guidance implies negative operating leverage unsurprisingly for 2024. But as you look at your, you know, trajectory on the revenue front, your assumptions there, combined with your expense expectations, how do you view the likelihood of achieving positive operating leverage in 2025 and when do you expect that you could break into a more positive trajectory on a quarterly basis? Thanks.', 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, John. So, I have a tendency to look at it on the -- on an annual basis. And you're right, we can't generate positive operating leverage in '24, primarily because of our outperformance in the first two quarters of '23, where we were having above 4% margin, which is way above most everybody. And so, I think that's been acknowledged in the marketplace."", ""I do think we can -- and we can get back in '25 to generate positive operating leverage, and we'll start trending there toward the back half of the year as we continue -- as we see us bottoming out in terms of net interest income and margin at the -- in the second quarter. And then we can start to grow from there. We'll see what the economy looks like. We'll see what loan growth looks like."", 'We think that picks up a bit, and we think the pressure on deposit betas start to go the other way. And as I just mentioned, we can exit with a little stronger margin. So, I think positive operating leverage toward the back half is a possibility.', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'And definitely for 2025.', 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""And we're going to get there for 2025."", 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Right. OK. Great. That's helpful."", ""And then secondly, around credit, regarding the NPA increase, I know you've flagged the downgrade -- the risk rating downgrades in some of the higher-risk sectors. Maybe could you give us a little bit more color, were there -- was it concentrated in any one sector? Was there a broader scrub of the loan book that you completed that led you to the multiple of the -- the multiple downgrades or is it just episodic? And then I guess just separately, can you talk about the reserve? I know you build it a bit here. What's the outlook there as you continue to add from here? Thanks."", 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. I'll just say, John, with respect to the increase in NPLs, and we've called out portfolios that have been under some stress for a number of quarters now, and what we saw in the quarter was some migration from criticized classified to nonperforming, specifically in senior housing, in transportation and warehousing, transportation specifically, and office. And then additionally, manufacturing of consumer discretionary items. So, that is -- and that was our expectation."", ""We have one large technology credit that moved in the third quarter that is episodic. We believe it's something that we can and believe we will manage through. So, when you look at the migration, as we pointed out, we are moving back to more traditional sort of historical levels of nonperforming loans, which is somewhere between 80 basis points and 100 basis points to 110 basis points. I think maybe David said the average was 102 or 106 -- 107 from '14 and '19, and we've guided to 40 basis points to 50 basis points of charge-offs, which we think is in line with our expectations for potential loss in the portfolio over time."", ""So, I think we feel we have good insight into the credits that we're managing. As to why, I would say the burden of increasing interest rates, increasing cost, cost of labor, operating costs, all those things have had an impact, specifically on the industries that we've historically now called out: transportation, senior housing, office, consumer discretionary. And with respect to the allowance, you know, we have a process we follow and go through every quarter. And I think we believe that -- we currently believe obviously that we've provided for potential losses in the portfolio over time."", ""Unless we experience growth in the portfolio, paydowns in the portfolio, some changes in outstandings in the portfolio or in economic conditions, you can assume that our allowance is appropriate and likely won't change. The trajectory of it will not change unless the economy changes."", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Right. And the only other thing, John, on that would be if the risk rating changed, the net -- go up or down, that also impacts your provisioning or release of reserves. So, I'd add that point with the other two or three that John mentioned."", 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""And, David, I'm sorry, if I could just -- regarding that last point, isn't risk rating migration negatively assumed? Isn't it now assumed as part of your outlook just given where we are in this downturn?"", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, that's right. You look at your reasonable and forecast period and think about where the credits are going. If that changes, so to go the other way, that can cause you not to have to provide anymore. So, we've provided what we think we need to have."", ""If things get better, then you don't need the reserves that you put up and you can release those reserves. If things get worse, then you have to provide more. You know, generally, loan growth is also a driver of having to add provision. If your loans are going the other way, then you don't need the reserves that you had set up for them."", ""So, you can have a release related to that. Economic conditions got a little better in the fourth quarter than the third, so that was a positive. But net-net, you know, we're continuing to look at the life of the loan and where that's going to go, and we think we have appropriate reserves for losses that are there."", 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'OK.

I know you've got many different categories of loans you're producing."", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, I think just in total, the kind of the front book, back book, between those two, is about 200 basis points to 250 basis points of pickup.

That's going on as front-book, back-book pieces have, call it, 300 basis points in loans."", 'Front book, back book are probably in the 150 to 200 range.', 'Dave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', ""OK. Great. And then just on capital, given your comments on 10% CET1, targeting that unadjusted, what does that mean for the pace of buybacks here? Is the fourth quarter pace a good one going forward for the next few quarters maybe?

What was the --', 'Dana Nolan -- Executive Vice President, Head of Investor Relations', 'The buyback pace.', 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', 'The buyback pace. So, again, we use the buyback as our last mechanism to help us keep our Common Equity Tier 1 in that 10% range. And so, the pace is do your favored earnings expectation take out the dividend.

David, can you share with us -- you guys have given us good detail on credit quality, and, John, you pointed out that, you know, the nonperforming loan increase was to these sectors of your portfolio that you've already identified as being weak. Could we look at it another way when -- and you gave us good details on Slides 27 and 28 on the leveraged portfolio and the shared national credit portfolio. How are those portfolios holding up credit-wise? And when you think back to where we were a year ago, I remember many of the calls, the word recession was used quite often in those calls."", ""We're not hearing that on this fourth quarter earnings call from most or nearly all the banks. So, have these portfolios held up better than what you would have thought it from a year ago?"", 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I would say yes, Gerard. The leveraged portfolio is largely relationship-based credit business. Those are banking relationships that we enjoy as we're close to those customers, and we've been close to them throughout this period of elevated rates. There was some risk as rates rose that we had -- that there may be some softness in the portfolio, but I think it's performed well."", ""The same is true of our shared national credit book. As we began to build a capital markets business to help us grow and diversify revenue and to meet more customer needs, we naturally then began to expand the size of our shared national credit book so that we could serve those customers that had need for those products and services. And with that, as you can imagine, comes some toll-free risks, single-name risks. And while -- I mentioned earlier, we have a technology credit that's fairly substantial, that's an NPL."", ""That is an example of a shared national credit exposure that we have good visibility into. We think has very limited risk of loss but still is a nonperforming loan. But overall, I would say, just based upon reflection on the performance of that book, it's been good. We've enjoyed expanding relationships, growing revenue from capital markets and/or deposits, treasury management that we enjoy with those customers."", ""And so, I think we've been pleased with the performance of both the leveraged book and the shared national credit book."", 'Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Very good. And then coming back to loans, I think, David, in your comments, you talked about loan demand remaining soft and you're looking for low single-digit growth for average loans in 2024. I know -- and during our careers, the shadow banking industry is -- you know, continued its competition against the banks. But it seems today, there's more coverage of the private equity side getting into lending, maybe greater than we've seen in years."", 'How are you guys competing against the private credit markets? And at the same time, are any of those private credit lenders, customers of yours that you have to balance that relationship of a customer competing against you?', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, we have very modest exposure to private equity who then is -- we're not lending to private equity to, in turn, lend into our customer base. So, if we have any exposure, it would be very modest there. Now, separately, we don't see private equity as a competitor necessarily within our core middle market customer base. I asked Ronnie Smith the question the other day if he could name a customer that we lost to private credit, and we can't think of one."", ""Now, that doesn't mean it's not occurring in some of the markets that we're in. But by and large, given our focus on the core middle market business and investment-grade-type shared national credit exposure, we're just not -- we're not seeing private credit as a competitor today on the wholesale side now.

So, appreciate the guidance on expense region and expense control there. But I did have a question on just an update on the technology modernization project and kind of what you're baking in for expenses in 2024 and if part of that other expense savings is related to, you know, maybe delaying some of that project until further years?"", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Brandon. So, we've given you our overall expense guide to be, you know, essentially flat after you carve out operational losses from the past year. You know, we continue to make investments in our business. Our -- we call it R2, which is our transformation project and cyber and risk management, consumer compliance."", ""A lot of investment in areas of the bank that we're looking to offset elsewhere. R2 project is coming along very well. We spend anywhere, depending on the year, 9% to 11% of our revenue in terms of technology cost. We don't expect that to change materially in the short term."", ""We continue to evaluate how we can better leverage technology. And I think we have a lot of upside potential to leverage that in our business to continue to improve and to continue to take out manual steps and manual processes and have a technology solution, too. So, we think our investment in technology is the right thing to do, and we're going to have a modern core deposit platform in the not-too-distant future, which we think will be a competitive advantage for us as well. So, anyway, that's kind of the spending range, if you will, 9 to 11 for revenue."", 'Brandon King -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'OK. And just to comment, no delays in the timing of that.', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah, no. Yeah. To answer your question specifically, that project is on time and on budget, no delays.', 'Brandon King -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'OK. And then just had a follow-up on credit and particularly in senior housing. I just wanted to get more details as far as your exposure there and what are you thinking as far as ultimate loss content and any protections from a credit loss perspective.', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. You know, we're seeing improvement in the senior housing space, notwithstanding the fact that we have a couple of credits we're carrying as nonperforming. We -- generally, occupancy rates are improving over time. Today, we've got about $63 million in -- some -- sorry, $57 million in and $118 million in nonperforming loans and reserves against those credits of about 3.7%."", 'So, I think we maybe provided information on Slide 20 in your deck. But we are seeing improvement in senior housing as occupancy rates pick up and people become a little more comfortable with communal living again among that age group.', 'Brandon King -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks for all the color.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question.', 'Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. I have one follow-up --', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Good morning. One follow-up question, David. I think very notable what you said to Ryan's line of questioning, the 3.6 exit rates for the net interest margin in the fourth quarter. You know, a lot of investors are now focused on that exit rate."", ""So, I'm just wondering if I could ask you to what the component pieces is -- or are, rather. So, unless you've changed anything on the -- in terms of adding swaps, it seems like you do have 1.6 billion of notional rolling off in the fourth quarter. So, I guess that's a good guide. You also mentioned a terminated swap gain in your 10-Q, but you had like a forward look for four quarters."", ""Wondering what that could be for 4Q '24. And then more notably, obviously, you guys have said unequivocally that it's the deposit assumptions that's really going to make a difference. I'm wondering sort of what the speed is that you're assuming on that 35% down beta, you know, especially if you think that the first rate cut I think you said was in May?"", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, I think, all in, the big drivers there are controlling the deposit costs. We do have a headwind of the $3 billion notional forward starting swap in the first quarter. And then we're kind of in the run rate."", ""The terminated swaps are in the amortization already. That -- those aren't the huge drivers. I think after we get our headwind and if rates start to come down, then, you know, like I said, almost 60% of our beta is associated with index deposits on the commercial side. So, they'll start to come down and you start then having the loan and security repricing, the fixed maturity repricing adding 200 basis points, 250 basis points that overwhelms that headwind toward the back end of the year."", ""And you get a little bit of loan growth in the back end. All that helps you propel you to a much stronger fourth quarter finish than you have at the beginning of the year. So, I think if you really looked at what is the one big thing that you have to get done, and it's controlling the deposit cost, and we do that through managing the beta as rates change, like I said, 55%, 60% of it index. The other is decisioning we have to make."", ""And that gets to be a little herky-jerky because, as I mentioned, some of that's money market that we can change pretty quickly. The other are CDs that were locked in today. It's seven months. And as things renew this month, next month, and going forward, we're looking to be shorter rather than longer, so that we are prepared to take advantage to reduce our deposit costs as rates come down."", 'Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst', ""And a follow-up to that, you know, you mentioned 55% to 60% of that down beta will be coming from these index commercial deposits. You know, one of your peers made a differentiation between index and contractual yesterday. And I guess just, you know, give us some sense of how much of that is contract versus index? And, you know -- but really, it sounds like you're confident that, either way, you can control that to the downside, especially, you know, if, as you said, loan growth remains soft this year."", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, when we say index, we're talking about it's tied to fed funds. It's when fed funds changes through the contract, it changes automatically. There's no -- it's not a contractual number locked in like a -- effectively a CD."", ""It's -- the day -- just like a loan that's based on SOFR. I mean, SOFR changes, so there's a loan rate that day. And so, that's what we're talking about when we say index deposits."", 'Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst', 'OK. Got it. Thank you.', 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question."", 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Matt.', ""Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst"", 'Good morning. Any updates on potential regulatory changes to the debit card interchange rate or overdraft fees and thinking about potential offsets to that?', 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, the -- so debit interchange, going through a discussion to adjust that down as was written in the original law. They had to revisit the cost associated with debit interchange. To the extent that does get put into place, that will have a negative impact to us starting -- I think that was going to be kicking in in June. So, it's about a half a year."", ""And based on our numbers, that's about a $45 million risk item to us in our NIR. Relative to the overdrafts, we're a long way from knowing where that comes out, if there are any changes, and I think that's a 2025 date that was mentioned. That just hit the wire. I think there's going to be a lot of discussion on that because it's -- we're disappointed in that."", ""We think provision of liquidity to our customer base is really, really important. We do charge a fee for that, but we're paying an item for somebody and charging a fee. And to the extent we return that item to where it was written or used, that entity is going to charge a fee. And so, it doesn't -- it's not helpful to not be able to provide liquidity to our customer base."", ""And so, we're hoping there's going to be further discussion on that point. And I think it'd be premature to really talk about the impact to OD until we get further down the road."", 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah.', ""Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst"", ""OK. And separately, you know, good to see the elevated check fraud came down as you expected and the outlook kind of implies that you're confident that you're past this issue. I guess just want to reconfirm that. And then also, just any meaningful changes that you made to address it and whether it's -- that showed up in expenses or will?"", 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I would just say that the countermeasures that we've put in place, which include talent, technology, process changes, all have been effective. And we believe going forward, the run rate will be $20 million to $25 million a quarter in operating losses. And the expenses associated with those countermeasures are embedded in our run rate and in our projection for expenses for 2024."", 'Dave Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. You know, we got to continue to be vigilant with regards to this, just like we are with cyber. So, we have bad people attacking us, as does every financial institution, and we have to continue to stay ahead of it. We feel good about what we put in place, but we are not sitting idle.', ""We're continuing to push and challenge ourselves to get even better than we are today."", ""Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst"", ""OK. Perfect. That's helpful. Thank you."", 'John Turner -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you. OK. Operator, is that the end of the call?', 'Operator', 'Yes.

Both companies provided shareholders with a total return (stock price plus dividends reinvested) on par with the S&P 500's 26% return."", 'These two tech giants are far from finished, though. After lapping a boom-bust cycle for digital payments during the pandemic, followed by a surge in interest rates from central banks fighting inflation (higher interest rates lower the present value of a stock), Visa and Mastercard could have another great decade ahead of them. This could be true even if a return to more sluggish economic growth is right around the corner.', ""Here's why Visa and Mastercard are great stocks to build a portfolio around in 2024 and beyond."", 'First, let\'s talk valuation. Both Visa and Mastercard\'s earnings multiples have contracted in the last couple of years because of the aforementioned spike in interest rates from near-zero to now over 5%. As a result, Visa and Mastercard stocks haven\'t been this ""cheap"" in years.', 'Cheapness is relative, though, because neither company is exactly a screaming value at this point. Clearly, investors expect modest revenue growth (high single digits to low teens on average) for years to come.', ""Is that a reasonable assumption? It could be. Digital payment infrastructure still has a head of steam behind it. In many areas of the globe, cash is still king. And in others where digital payments have made significant headway, it's impossible to track exactly how much cash is still being used to enact daily transactions between people and businesses."", ""In fact, according to Worldpay (a division of fellow payments technologist Fiserv), some 1.4 billion of the world's approximate 6 billion adult population still have no bank account at all -- most of them in emerging markets with young populations."", ""Suffice it to say, there's plenty of room for more digital payments expansion, especially in tandem with smartphones and app-based services (versus traditional cards issued by a bank). Add on Visa and Mastercard's steady investment in data security services and the like, and these two could indeed keep putting up the kind of steady growth numbers investors have come to expect, even if global economic growth continues to slow in the aftermath of the pandemic."", ""But there's more to this story than just growth. As I wrote a few months ago, Visa in particular has been an exceptional business at generating above-average return on invested capital (ROIC) -- a way to measure the profit a company has generated from money it has invested in itself."", ""There's another way to view this ability to convert invested dollars into more cash: the amount of capital expenditures (spending on property and equipment) versus growth in net income and free cash flow. Again, you can see for every dollar Visa spends, it has generated far more than that in profit."", ""Visa's data centers and private communications network are top-notch and incredibly efficient. There's hope that Mastercard's smaller payments network can achieve a similar financial effect over time."", ""Either way, both Visa and Mastercard have managed to increase their already incredibly high profit margins over the last decade -- and they're still rising. That gives these two financial technology leaders ample cash to invest, repurchase stock, and increase their dividends."", 'Perhaps shares of Visa and Mastercard will dip at some point this year. Earnings reports that will include an outlook for calendar year 2024 will be delivered late in January, which tends to add a shot of volatility to stock prices.', ""But I don't expect much in the way of an operational surprise from these two leading tech giants.

For instance, it’s the main driver behind degens chasing the highs of meme coins like BONK or dogwifhat, which truly serve little economic function beyond speculation.', 'But to write off bitcoin simply as a turn of the roulette wheel with $800 billion on the table is to willingly mislead oneself. You don’t have to personally believe what bitcoiners believe to take their arguments seriously, for fear of mockery or ostracization (FOMOO) by your crypto-skeptic peers, Jeff.', 'To be fair, Sommer did tip his hat to the technology behind Bitcoin, i.e. b l o c k c h a i n, to hedge his own argument. To wit:', '“Bitcoin is a serious proposition, in terms of its underlying structure. The use of blockchain, the decentralized, peer-to-peer structure and the complex mathematical code demand respect. Concepts embedded in Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies could have real-world importance at some point…”', 'This was not Sommer’s only completely original and novel thought, he also steadfastly argued that cryptocurrency is a “misnomer” because cryptocurrencies, despite maybe one day having “real-world” utility somewhere, are not really “currencies.” And, he said, the comparison between bitcoin and gold is off because gold has historical “cache.”', ""As the great and powerful Satoshi Nakamoto once said, “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.” At this point it’s not even worth addressing these extremely tired arguments, which seem to be carried out by seasoned journalists everytime crypto notches some victory."", 'But considering that they’re brand new, I’ll try to do Sommer a solid and get him up-to-date on why interest in bitcoin ETFs is more than FOMO.', 'First, there is Bitcoin’s philosophical proposition — the idea that there ought to be a global, stateless monetary network available to all. Often called a libertarian wet-dream, the Bitcoin vision is so simple it actually slots neatly into a range of political philosophies — from globalizing neoconservatism to historical Marxism, just not anything truly authoritarian.', 'Again, you don’t have to buy into the rising trend towards populism to take an interest in it. Many people are feeling with the spread of corporate and governmental surveillance; rising economic inequality; and other geopolitical issues that something like Bitcoin, which empowers everyone without asking for anything of any particular user in return, is a powerful symbol at the very least.', 'Second, there is the fact that bitcoin is one of the most successful economic investments on record. It may not be the best performing asset every year, and certainly many people have lost money trading it, but there is no denying bitcoin’s meteoric gains over the past decade and a half.', 'See also: Bitcoin ETF Net Inflows Near $1B After Three Days', 'This is where the idea of “hodling” comes in, which recommends people buy and hold bitcoin over a long time horizon, because even if the always-volatile bitcoin dips, those are only paper-losses until you sell. Bitcoin ETFs help a larger swath of retail and institutional buyers access BTC, typically through vehicles like retirement accounts or corporate treasuries that will likely hodl for years if not decades.', 'True, bitcoin is not guaranteed to rise in price and could even drop to $0. And true, as Sommer points out, there are other ways to gain exposure to crypto via traditional routes, like buying other indexes that invest in crypto-related stocks, like Coinbase, MicroStrategy or the many publicly listed mining companies.', 'Simply put, there is something powerful to the idea of actually owning an asset that cannot be seized. Spot bitcoin ETFs are a poor approximation of that since buyers of the ETFs never actually get their hands on bitcoin.', 'But Sommer is shutting himself off to that idea early, and trying to convince his readers that the massive interest in bitcoin that was just demonstrably proven via the launch of 11 bitcoin ETFs this month is all just FOMO. The sad thing is, the argument works just as well in reverse: Even if demand for bitcoin is just a matter of social contagion, then so is skepticism, because you need to hear about something to turn away from it. So, check your sources.', 'CORRECTION (JAN. 19, 2024): Removes reference to in-kind redemptions, which were not part of the SEC process.']"

The MSCI index for Latin American currencies was up 0.4% at 1930 GMT against a steady dollar, but set for weekly declines of 1.3%. Chile\'s peso rose 0.9% to trade at 909.1 to the dollar as the currency of the world\'s biggest copper producer was boosted by a rise in prices of the metal.

A broader gauge of Latin American equities rose 0.8% but was set for a weekly loss of 3.4% - the steepest since early October.

Brazil\'s economic activity lagged expectations in November, central bank data showed on Friday. The Colombian peso reversed initial losses to inch 0.1% higher.

S&P\'s decision was met with skepticism by Wall Street banks and investors, who said the move was ""unexpected"" and ""inconsistent.""

222,04fe108a-b43e-3b25-b203-e3147cda409a,NVDA,2024-01-20,Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 28% of His Portfolio Invested in 3 Brilliant AI Growth Stocks,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/04fe108a-b43e-3b25-b203-e3147cda409a/billionaire-investor-david.html,1705752900,STORY,"['MSFT', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', '^GSPC']","[""Billionaire David Tepper runs Appaloosa Management, a hedge fund that has regularly outperformed industry peers and the broader stock market since it was founded in 1993. Indeed, Appaloosa beat the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 15 percentage points over the last three years. That suggests Tepper and his fund's investment choices are worth studying."", 'As of the September quarter, Tepper had 28.2% of his Appaloosa portfolio invested in just three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks: 8.8% in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), 9.4% in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and 10% in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). That level of asset allocation is a clear sign of high conviction.', ""Here's what investors should know about these three brilliant AI stocks."", 'Nvidia has a strong presence in two semiconductor markets: graphics chips for gaming and professional design and data center accelerators (graphics processing units or GPUs) for complex workloads like scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics, and it holds 80% to 95% market share in AI computing.', 'Nvidia has extended its ability to monetize both markets with subscription software and cloud services. Omniverse is a virtual design and simulation platform for developing 3D and robotics applications, as well as training autonomous vehicles. DGX Cloud is an AI application development platform comprising infrastructure, software, and pre-trained machine learning models. Many investors mistakenly see Nvidia as nothing more than a chipmaker, but that description fails to account for its growing software and services business. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino says Nvidia\'s ""software capabilities provide an incredible competitive moat.""', 'In recent years, Nvidia has broadened its data center portfolio with networking platforms and central processing units (CPUs), both purpose-built for AI workloads. Networking revenue nearly tripled over the past year, and Nvidia is well positioned to take share in CPUs given that it holds 95% market share in data center GPUs.', 'Going forward, the graphics processor market is forecast to increase by 28% annually through 2030, while the AI market is forecast to increase by 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at annual sales growth exceeding 25% through the end of the decade. Even in that context, its current valuation of 30.4 times sales looks pricey, but I think patient investors willing to hold the stock for at least five years can buy a small position today.', 'Amazon has a strong presence in three markets: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Specifically, it operates the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe as measured by sales volume. Amazon is also the largest retail advertiser in the U.S. and the third-largest ad tech company in the world. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services.', 'That last point is particularly relevant. To quote Argus analyst Jim Kelleher, ""As the leading provider of infrastructure-as-a-service and other cloud services, AWS is uniquely positioned in the burgeoning AI-as-a-service market."" Indeed, the company is a recognized leader in cloud AI developer services, and its product pipeline is packed with AI innovations.', 'Amazon Bedrock became generally available in September. That service provides pre-trained machine learning models and development tools that help businesses build generative AI applications. More recently, the company announced Amazon Q, a generative AI business assistant that can create content and surface insights across data sources and enterprise systems like Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce, and ServiceNow.', 'Going forward, retail e-commerce sales are forecast to increase by 8% annually through 2030, while the ad tech and cloud computing markets are forecast to expand by 14% annually during the same period. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit annual sales growth through the end of the decade, which makes its current valuation of 2.9 times sales look quite reasonable.', 'Microsoft has a strong presence in two markets: enterprise software and cloud computing. The company accounts for more than 16% of software-as-a-service spending, nearly double the market share of its closest competitor, due to its leadership position in office productivity and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Similarly, Microsoft Azure accounts for 23% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending, second only to Amazon Web Services.', 'Microsoft is adding AI capabilities to its enterprise software to create new monetization opportunities. Microsoft 365 Copilot is a generative AI assistant that automates workflows across office productivity applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Similarly, Copilot for Dynamics 365 automates workflows across ERP applications for sales, marketing, customer service, and supply chain management.', 'Microsoft is also investing heavily in AI across its cloud computing business. Azure is the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI, and it\'s the only cloud platform that provides access to pre-trained models from OpenAI, including the GPT models that power ChatGPT. Businesses can use those models to build custom generative AI applications. JPMorgan Chase analysts believe ""Microsoft\'s investment into OpenAI, which started years ago, could potentially prove to be some of the best money ever spent.""', 'Going forward, enterprise software-as-a-service and cloud computing sales are forecast to grow at 14% annually through 2030. That gives Microsoft a good shot at double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade. In that light, its current valuation of 13.3 times sales looks a bit pricey. I think patient investors can buy a small position today, but waiting for a cheaper price may be the most prudent course of action.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Such trades require taking on above-average risk, of course, with no assurance of a major return being achieved. They also often need years to fully pan out. But they can certainly be worth it.', ""With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three prospects that could turn a $10,000 investment into a relative fortune. Just keep close tabs on them if you decide to take a swing. After all, these stocks offer tremendous upside potential specifically because their underlying companies' futures remain a bit murky."", ""Mankind has been deploying communication satellites since the late 1950s, and using them in earnest since the 1960s. Since the beginning of this century they've been used to offer broadband-based internet access to and from outer space."", ""And yet, we've only scratched the surface of the potential demand for satellite-based communications. The ongoing digitization of, well, everything is forcing enterprises and institutions to find more efficient ways to handle more and more information."", 'Enter Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB).', ""Just as the name suggests, Rocket Lab puts satellites into space. To date, more than 1,700 satellites are in orbit thanks to the company's technology. It's also already got 22 launches lined up for the year now underway, many of which will be carrying multiple satellites. More launches could be scheduled for this year in the meantime too. That may raise the 19% revenue growth rate analysts are currently anticipating for 2024."", 'This new era of space-based telecom is still in its infancy, however. Now that all these related technologies -- and the need for them -- have caught up with one another, industry research and consulting firm Quilty Space believes roughly 20,000 additional satellites will be put into orbit before the end of the decade.', ""And Rocket Lab USA's off to a great start winning this not-so-distant-future business. Although this year's growth outlook isn't exactly out of this world, the analyst community expects its top line to swell an impressive 72% next year."", ""That still won't be enough to push the company out of the red and into the black. It will push it in that direction, though, further fleshing out Rocket Lab's long-term potential as a solutions provider in the rapidly evolving orbital launch business."", ""It's been a tough year for solar power equipment maker Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH), and by extension, for Enphase Energy shareholders. Shares are down more than 60% since late 2022, with economic malaise undermining demand for new solar panel installations."", ""Don't mistake a short-term headwind as a fading long-term opportunity, however. Enphase should still have its day in the sun."", ""If you're not familiar, Enphase Energy makes solar power hardware. It doesn't make solar panels, though; panels are practically a commodity anymore. Rather, Enphase manufactures inverters that convert the sun's rays into usable electricity. Its IQ8 microinverters work as well in commercial settings as they do in residential, although its corresponding tech makes Enphase's equipment very well-suited for home use."", ""As was noted, last year was a toughie. Analysts believe the company will report full-year sales growth of nil when it posts its fourth-quarter results early next month. Earnings likely fell just a bit. The same analyst community expects the company's top and bottom lines to fall this year, with demand for solar power technology remaining under duress thanks to economic headwinds."", ""Take a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. Solar power is the heart of the energy industry's future. Even with its current weakness, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects solar power to account for nearly all of the nation's power-production capacity this year and next, mirroring clean-energy initiatives in other parts of the world. Indeed, that projected 79 gigawatts' worth of additional power-generating installations should drive solar's share of domestic energy production from last year's 4% to 7% by the end of 2025, again mirroring worldwide demand."", ""Things are even more compelling for the longer haul. Mordor Intelligence says the global energy market will expand at an annualized pace of nearly 30% between now and 2029. Enphase stock's recent pullback is a means of stepping into that megatrend at a discount."", 'Last but not least, add Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to your list of stocks a $10,000 investment in today could grow into a fortune 10 years from now.', ""It's the biggest and best-grounded of the three companies in question. That's why its potential gains are also the smallest -- it's the lowest-risk prospect of the three. That doesn't mean it can't dish out serious gains in the foreseeable future, though."", 'The key to this growth is the advent of artificial intelligence.', ""While the world's done amazing things with the technology so far, we've only just begun to figure out how to commercialize AI. Precedence Research believes the worldwide AI market is going to swell from 2023's total of around $500 billion to more than $2.5 trillion in 2032. Nvidia's place in this market? It makes the hardware that makes AI possible. Estimates put its market share at around 90%."", ""The key to winning and keeping this commanding market share is Nvidia's purpose-built, turnkey AI platforms that leverage the company's well-proven video processing architecture. As it turns out, the same tech that makes for great graphics cards is ideally suited for AI applications as well."", 'In fact, Nvidia\'s latest GeForce RTX Super GPUs (graphics processing units) allow laptops to be generative AI workstations, while its HGX H200 platform unveiled in November of last year ""delivers 141GB of memory at 4.8 terabytes per second, nearly double the capacity and 2.4x more bandwidth compared with its predecessor, the NVIDIA A100."" It matters simply because more computing speed makes for more powerful AI applications.', ""The AI business's highest-growth days are likely in the past. The runway is still very long, however, with tons of opportunity ahead. And, with roughly three-fourths of the company's revenue now coming from AI solutions, the industry's impending growth bodes well for Nvidia."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Rocket Lab USA right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Rocket Lab USA, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Rocket Lab USA wasn't one of them.

If you wish to see more such stocks within our list, you can go directly to read the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Healthcare Stocks To Consider.', 'Globally, retirees are exploring investment opportunities to supplement their income, driven by the highest inflation recorded in nearly four decades. In response to this concern, the Social Security Administration addressed the issue by announcing an 8.7% increase in benefits earlier in 2023 to mitigate the impact of inflation, as reported by Bloomberg. With this adjustment, the average retiree benefit reached $1,827 per month, marking a $146 increase from the year 2022. However, given the average annual household expenses for individuals aged 65-74 amounting to approximately $53,000, these social security benefits fall short of adequately covering living costs.', 'In times of economic challenges, investors, particularly those looking forward to a secure retirement, tend to lean towards low-risk stocks that offer reasonable returns amid heightened uncertainties. Consequently, healthcare and consumer stocks often become the preferred choices when navigating significant macroeconomic headwinds. The healthcare industry has undergone profound changes, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. Advances in medical technology, pharmaceuticals, and treatment methodologies have brought about a revolution in patient care and outcomes.', ""The healthcare sector includes a broad spectrum of companies, covering pharmaceuticals, manufacturers of medical equipment and devices, providers of medical insurance, and various other healthcare services. Due to the diverse range of services offered, which frequently contribute to higher life expectancy and enhanced quality of life, the healthcare sector plays a substantial role in the global economic landscape. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, government data highlights that health spending in the US is anticipated to reach nearly $7.2 trillion by 2031. This spending is projected to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy in the coming years. Healthcare expenses are expected to constitute 19.6% of the country's total economic output (GDP), up from 18.3% in 2021. In addition, the industry is expected to witness a 12.8% increase in earnings in 2024, slightly surpassing the 11.8% growth anticipated for the S&P 500. This growth is fueled, in part, by an elevated demand for products such as obesity drugs."", ""Pharmaceutical companies, an extension of the overall healthcare industry, are commonly categorized as defensive, given their role in producing essential health maintenance and illness treatment products. The demand for these products tends to remain relatively stable, even during economic downturns. Notably, the sector provided favorable returns to investors in 2022, marked by the S&P 500's weakest annual performance since 2008. From December 2021 to December 2022, the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index recorded a gain of 4.91%, contrasting sharply with the S&P 500's significant 19.4% decline. Over the past 5 years, the index has shown an increase of 67.48%. With that in mind, some of the best healthcare stocks to buy for a retirement stock portfolio include the likes of Pfizer Inc.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report exceptional top and bottom line results for the quarter. Core income, earnings per share and return on equity were all record highs driven by both underwriting and investment results. Our underwriting gains were broad-based.In each of our 3 segments, underlying underwriting income was higher and prior year development was favorable. Catastrophe losses were also light. Record underlying underwriting income resulted from net earned premiums of $10 billion, up more than 13% over the prior year quarter and an underlying combined ratio, which improved 5.5 points to a record 85.9%.Looking at our 2 commercial segments together, the aggregate BI BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 85.9% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance was coincidentally also 85.9%, an improvement of more than 10 points year-over-year. In addition, we are pleased to have delivered full year core income of $3.1 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.5%.Notwithstanding elevated industry-wide catastrophe losses earlier in the year, and a personal lines operating environment that while improving was difficult during the year.Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well. Generating after-tax net investment income of $645 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio.Our operating results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 8% during the year. After making important investments in our business and returning nearly $2 billion of excess capital to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 13% to $10 billion in the quarter. For the year, we grew net written premiums by 14% to more than $40 billion. All 3 segments contributed to our top line success. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums in the quarter by 14% to more than $5 billion. Renewal premium change remained high at 11.8% while retention also remained high at 87%.The combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and the disciplined marketplace. The segment generated $672 million of new business in the quarter, which was $118 million or about 20% higher than in the prior year quarter.In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7% to $989 million, driven by excellent production in our surety business, where net written premiums were up 9%. Production was also strong in our management liability business. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments.In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 21.2% in home and 16.7% in our auto business. Renewal premium change alone contributed more than $2 billion of written premium in this segment over the past year. With another strong production -- with another year of strong production in each of our segments, we feel very well positioned for the new year. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to take a minute and put our 2023 results into an overtime context with an update to some data we shared previously. A half dozen or so years ago, we laid out a focused innovation strategy. Ensure that if we were successful in this execution, we would expect to grow our business at attractive returns. A reflection of our belief that any strategy to achieve industry-leading returns over time requires a strategy to grow over time.The data on Slide 19 of the webcast presentation show the success we've achieved. Starting at the top left corner. In terms of the top line, we've grown net written premiums at a compound annual rate of 7% over the past 7 years. That's 2.5x our rate of growth from 2012 to 2016. The growth rate in each of the past 2 years was double digits, the result of a deliberate and tailored strategy, stronger pricing where we need it and a combination of pricing and unit growth where we like the opportunity.In Business Insurance, we've added more than $4 billion to our top line over the past 2 years. The investments we've made in capabilities to enhance the franchise value that we offer to our customers and distribution partners have contributed to strong retention and growth in new business.In Bond & Specialty, we've increased net written premiums over that period by about $0.5 billion or 14%. More than half of that growth has come from a very profitable surety business, where our market-leading position has enabled us to benefit from increased demand for bonds with higher contract values and projects resulting from the Federal Infrastructure and Jobs Act and other federal programs.Across both of our commercial segments, since 2021, we have about doubled our E&S writings to around $2.5 billion. That includes organic growth from the E&S business we write in National Property, our North field business and our Lloyd's business as well as the impact of more recent strategic efforts, which include our relationships with Fidelis and Corvus.The margins in our E&S business are quite attractive. In Personal Insurance, where margins have not been at target levels in recent periods. Net written premium growth of $3.4 billion over the past 2 years has been almost entirely a result of price increases. The PI team has done an excellent job of threading the needle, maintaining a strong customer base while achieving meaningful pricing gains.They've also done a great job with private product management. Our advanced peril-by-peril Quantum Auto 2.0 offering now represents more than 60% of the domestic property portfolio. And adoption of our telematics product and Teledrive among new customers has been strong. With pricing gains and enhanced product sophistication, the book should contribute to our earnings power going forward as we move to our target returns.Also important is that across all 3 segments, we've grown mostly in products, classes of business and geographies and through distribution partners that we know well. That gives us a lot of confidence in the business we're adding to the books. Moving to the right, you can see that while we've meaningfully increased our rate of growth, we've maintained very strong and consistent underlying profitability.That demonstrates that we're not growing by underpricing the business or compromising our underwriting discipline. We've grown by investing in the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell. We've also grown through a lot of great hustle and hard work on the part of our outstanding field organization. One of the clear strategic objectives of our innovation strategy has been to optimize productivity and efficiency. Moving to the top right of the slide, you can see that over the last 7 years, we've reduced our expense ratio by 3.6 points to just over 28% for 2023, which is more than a 10% reduction relative to our 2012 to 2016 expense ratio of around 32%. Enhanced operating leverage gives us the flexibility to let the benefit fall to the bottom line and/or invest further in our strategic priorities.Case in point, as you can see on Slide 21, since 2017, we have doubled our investments in strategic technology initiatives. Over that same period, we've carefully managed growth in routine but necessary technology expenditures. In other words, over a 7-year period, we simultaneously and meaningfully increased our technology spend, improve the strategic mix of that spend and lowered our expense ratio.The upshot of what we've accomplished on the top half of Slide 19 is what you see on the bottom half. On the bottom left, you can see that we've increased underlying underwriting income significantly. From 2012 to 2019, underlying underwriting income averaged $1.3 billion. In 2020, we crossed the $2 billion mark, and 2023 marks the first time that we've exceeded $3 billion.We've taken our underlying underwriting income to a meaningfully higher level. We've also significantly increased our cash flow from operations to more than $7.5 billion in 2023. The fourth consecutive year it's been more than $6 billion and more than double our average cash flow from operations in the earlier part of the last decade. Cash flow isn't a metric that we or our industry talk a lot about, but it's important. It's what gives us the ability to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders and grow the investment portfolio.We've grown our investment portfolio significantly to nearly $93 billion. As we continue to reinvest our fixed income portfolio at higher rates, this is a highly reliable lever of earnings and value creation. To sum it up through a well-executed strategy, we've more than doubled our rate of growth, sustained strong underlying underwriting margins and meaningfully lowered our expense ratio.That has resulted in record levels of underlying underwriting income, cash flow and invested assets. Ultimately, of course, one number that brings everything together is adjusted book value per share. On Slide 20, you can see that we have steadily increased adjusted book value per share each year since 2006 at a compound annual rate of 7.5%.The effective management of our capital complements that result. We've increased our capital base to support the profitable growth of our business. At the same time, we've been disciplined about returning excess capital to shareholders. Over this period, we've increased our dividend at a compound annual rate of more than 8% and returned more than $40 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases at an average price of about $74 per share.These results, together with our track record of strong returns and low volatility demonstrate the strength of our business and the success of our overtime strategy. Looking ahead, we're very confident about how we're positioned for 2024 and beyond. The fundamentals across our business are in excellent shape. We're confident that we're focused on the right strategic priorities and that with demonstrated success in execution, there's plenty more opportunity ahead of us. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, and core return on equity was 24%, both all-time record quarterly results. We're pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 85.9%, a 5.5 point improvement from last year's quarter. The combination of premium growth and underlying margin improvement led to underlying underwriting income of $1.1 billion after tax, up $511 million or 89% from the prior year quarter.The underlying combined ratio improved from the prior year in all 3 segments. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter improved by 0.5 point from last year's quarter to 27.4%, once again, reflecting the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. The full year expense ratio of 28.1% was our best ever. As Alan mentioned, our focus is on operating leverage. And looking ahead to 2024, we're comfortable with the annual expense ratio in the range of 28% to 28.5% for now. Our fourth quarter results include a modest $125 million of pretax catastrophe losses with no individually significant events impacting our book of business. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $132 million pretax, with all 3 segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $56 million was driven by favorability in workers' comp that was partially offset by adverse development in umbrella and general liability. Even after the reserve charge, the returns in both umbrella and GL remain very attractive.In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $36 million was driven by better-than-expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal Insurance had $40 million of net favorable PYD driven by homeowners and other. After-tax net investment income of $645 million was up 21% from the prior year quarter.Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets.Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also higher than in the prior year quarter. In terms of our outlook for fixed income NII for 2024, including earnings from short-term securities, we expect approximately $2.6 billion after tax, beginning with approximately $630 million in the first quarter and growing to approximately $675 million in the fourth quarter.Page 22 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1st catastrophe reinsurance renewal. Our long-standing cat XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events. And we've increased the amount of total coverage for 2024. Despite the growth in our property book, our attachment point remains steady, and the per occurrence loss deductible is unchanged at $100 million.For 2024, we have placed coverage for $3.5 billion of the $4.5 billion layer above the $3.5 billion attachment point. We're pleased to have obtained the extra protection in light of the recent inflationary impact on insured values. With context, we've never hit this treaty. Nonetheless, this is prudent, affordable balance sheet protection for tail events. The cost of the additional reinsurance will be largely offset by the strong renewal pricing we continue to achieve on our direct written property premiums resulting in only a de minimis impact on the underlying combined ratio.On a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 23 of the webcast presentation. As we enter 2024, we thought it would be helpful to once again highlight the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. Cat losses in the second quarter had been on average, more than 3 combined ratio points higher than in any other quarter.And the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in 7 of the past 10 years. Also of interest for 2024, in light of continued strong pricing and terms in the E&S and reinsurance markets, we are pleased to share that we have renewed the 20% quota share with Fidelis. The renewal includes the same loss ratio cap we had for 2023. The written premium volume, which will again be included as part of international within the Business Insurance segment is not expected to be material to the segment. but should have a modestly favorable impact on the underlying combined ratio for 2024 as it earns in.Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.1 billion were again very strong. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. As you may have seen, S&P issued their updated capital model, and we now expect that the result of the new model will be a modest improvement in their assessment of our capital metrics. Interest rates decreased and spreads narrowed during the quarter. And as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $6.5 billion after tax at September 30 to $3.1 billion after tax at year-end.As we've discussed previously, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity, the quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have a little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $122.90 at year-end, up 8% from a year ago. We returned $298 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $66 million and dividends of $232 million. We have approximately $6 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.Thinking about share repurchases in 2024, while there is no change in our capital management philosophy, we will factor in the need for increased capital in light of our top line growth as well as the $435 million we just deployed to complete the Corvus acquisition. Currently, we expect repurchases in the first quarter of somewhere around $250 million.Recapping our results for 2023. Core income was $3.1 billion, and core ROE was 11.5%. We delivered our highest ever levels of written premium, earned premium, underlying underwriting income and cash flow from operations. In addition, we ended the year with our all-time high in adjusted book value per share and with our largest investment portfolio ever. We've never been better positioned for the year ahead.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance."", 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding on a terrific year in terms of financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. Last year at this time, I indicated that we were firing on all cylinders, and that certainly remains the case today. Segment income for the quarter was $957 million, our highest quarter ever and up well over $200 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower catastrophes.The all-in combined ratio of 86.5% was a great result, and we're once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 86.8% and an all-time best result. The underlying loss ratio improved by almost 2.5 points from the prior year quarter, with the drivers of the improvement, including the benefit of earned pricing a mix shift to the property line and an impact from non-cat weather that was modestly favorable to both the prior year and our expectations.The expense ratio remained excellent at 28.8%. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 14% from the prior year to a fourth quarter record of $5 billion, benefiting from high retention, strong renewal premium change and an increase in new business levels. As Alan mentioned, given the attractive margins in this segment, we're very pleased with this growth.Turning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 11.8%, with renewal rate change of 7.4% and continued strong growth and exposure. Renewal rate change increased from the third quarter in select and middle market, however, ticked down at the segment level, driven almost entirely by a lower mix of national property written premium in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.Retention remained excellent at 87% and new business of $672 million was the strongest fourth quarter we've ever produced. We're thrilled with these production results and our field superior execution in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to be able to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change to address the persistent environmental headwinds. As for renewal rate change, during the quarter, we achieved meaningful renewal rate increases in all lines other than workers' comp.The property, umbrella and auto lines led the way. Renewal rate change in each of the casualty lines was comparable or better than the third quarter. And given our high-quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels.As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remained strong at 11.9%, up more than 1.5 points from the third quarter driven by renewal rate change, which increased to 4.1% for the quarter. Even with strong pricing, retention remained very strong at 85%. New business was up $49 million from the prior year quarter driven in large part by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product.In middle market, renewal premium change of 10.4% and retention of 90% remained historically strong. New business of $348 million was an all-time best fourth quarter result. As we close out 2023, let me provide a little color on full year results before turning the call over to Jeff. Segment income was nearly $2.6 billion, an exceptional result. The underlying combined ratio of 88.9%, top line of $20.4 billion. Renewal premium change, retention and new business premiums were all record results. These results are a direct reflection of our successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies.And while delivering these financial and production results, we've also continued to invest in strategic capabilities that will enhance our many competitive advantages. For example, during the year, we continued to advance our data and analytics capabilities by leveraging evolving technologies, including AI, and new data sources to help us manage the portfolio and equip our frontline underwriters with data and insights to better enable our risk selection, underwriting and pricing.In addition, we continued to advance our already state-of-the-art product and service capabilities by continuing to roll out our BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in all but a couple of states as well as our new commercial auto product, which is now live in 14 states.Both products deliver industry-leading segmentation and user experiences. In addition, we continue to make progress on developing other industry-leading user experience capabilities to make it easier and more efficient for our distribution partners and customers to do business with us. In particular, in our middle market business, we advanced our capabilities around digitizing the underwriting transaction for our agents and brokers.In our Small Commercial business, we continued to roll out our new front-end rate quote and issue interface platform to make it faster and easier for our agents to write business with us, while maintaining all the underwriting discipline and specialization behind the scenes. And finally, we continued to improve our operating leverage through our relentless focus on productivity and efficiency. We're proud of these extraordinary results in the best-in-class team that produce them.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."", 'Jeffrey Peter Klenk', ""Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty ended a strong 2023 with a terrific quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $240 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter. delivered very strong underlying underwriting income and an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 80.6%. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 7% in the quarter. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90%, in line with the prior year quarter, while continuing to achieve positive renewal premium change.New business was up driven by a new domestic cyber capacity agreement with Corvus. Surety net written premiums increased 9%, reflecting continued strong demand for surety bonds. So we're pleased to have once again delivered terrific top and bottom line results this quarter, capping off a year during which we generated record segment income and net written premium.Finally, we're pleased that earlier this month, we closed our previously announced acquisition of Corvus Insurance. Corvus is an industry-leading cyber insurance managing general underwriter, powered by proprietary technology. Corvus has developed cutting-edge capabilities, including digitally integrated cyber sales, underwriting, service and support, sophisticated underwriting algorithms and advanced vulnerability scanning.Corvus also brings deep cyber underwriting and risk management expertise, and we're pleased to welcome them to the Travelers family. This acquisition affords us the opportunity to write Corvus' profitable book of business which will be reflected as new business in our production results over the course of 2024.And now I'll turn the call over to Michael."", 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Personal Insurance generated $520 million of fourth quarter segment income, strong results and a significant improvement compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.9% improved over 10 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting improvements in both Automobile and Homeowners and Other.Net written premiums grew 13%, driven by continued elevated levels of renewal premium change in both Auto and Home bringing full year net written premiums to a record of nearly $16 billion. In automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 103.6%. The underlying combined ratio of 102.7% improved nearly 8 points compared to the prior year quarter.This improvement was driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing. To a lesser extent, it also benefited from the year-over-year impact of a modest favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year compared to a modest unfavorable re-estimation in the prior year quarter.In Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 70.8% improved by over 28 points, reflecting catastrophe losses that were favorable to both the prior year quarter and our expectations and an improved underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio improved 12.5 points, primarily due to non-catastrophe weather-related losses that were favorable to both the prior year and our expectations and the impact of earned pricing.Turning to production. Our results demonstrate our continued disciplined execution of rate and non-rate actions to improve profitability and manage growth. In domestic automobile retention remained consistent. Renewal premium change of 16.7% remains strong and as expected, moderated from the third quarter of 2023, as the majority of our book reached rate adequacy on a written basis.We expect renewal premium change to remain in the mid-teens through the first half of 2024 as we continue to assess the environment and seek rate on a state-by-state basis as appropriate. We're pleased to note that auto new business increased relative to the prior year quarter, as we tempered our non-rate actions in states where we've achieved written rate adequacy. We will continue to evaluate our non-rate measures as more states reach adequacy throughout 2024.In Homeowners and Other, retention remained consistent even as renewal premium change reached a record level at 21.2%, primarily driven by higher renewal rate change. As we noted last quarter, we expect homeowners' renewal premium change to moderate to low double digits in 2024. We will continue to see great increases in response to elevated loss levels. But at the same time, our automatic increase in limit factors will return to more normal levels, reflecting the progress we've made on aligning insured values with replacement costs.Our continued efforts to manage new business flow and thoughtfully deploy capacity in the face of market dislocation drove the year-over-year decline in homeowners new business and policies enforced during the quarter. We anticipate this trend will continue as we take further actions to improve profitability and manage growth in property.In 2023, we made notable progress on improving the underlying fundamentals of our business and are moving towards our goal of delivering target returns. While the environment remains dynamic, we're confident we're on a path to generating leading returns in personal insurance and growing profitably over time.Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."", 'Abbe F. Goldstein', ""Thanks very much. We're happy to open up for your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.', 'David Kenneth Motemaden', 'I just had a question on the Business Insurance underlying loss ratio. And if you could size the components of the improvement between earned pricing above trend the light non-cat weather as well as the property mix shift?', 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""David, it's Dan. So we're not going to put numbers on them. But price versus trend has been favorable throughout the last couple of years and was favorable again this quarter. A little bit of a mix shift towards property, as Greg said, and modestly favorable non-cat weather impact, not huge but worth to mention, but we're not going to put numbers on each of those."", 'David Kenneth Motemaden', ""Got it. And then I think it's been 5 of the last 7 quarters or something like that where you guys called out the general liability umbrella as areas of reserve increases in business insurance. I'm wondering if we could get a little bit more detail about exactly what you guys are seeing and reacting to, and if you think we're closer to the end of some of these true-ups?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Sure, David. It's Dan again. So not big, big movements this quarter, more of the same, more of what we've sort of been talking about the last couple of quarters, which is no surprises in terms of the themes of the things that we're seeing come through those numbers, but the magnitude has been a little greater than we had allowed for previously, and we're just looking at the data that comes in every quarter and try to make sure we stay as current with it as we can. And so a modest reaction to keep up with that, but nothing really new."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.', 'Charles Gregory Peters', ""Well, first of all, you had a great fourth quarter, so congratulations. But I wanted to focus on Slide 7, the return on equity slide and you guys have all mapped out really a pretty strong outlook. And I guess I'm trying to reconcile what is looks to be a very pretty good outlook with the fact that your ROE is running below where I think it should be.I feel like the ROE should be running higher. So maybe, Alan, you can provide some perspectives because I know the ROE is an important factor that you guys look at."", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Greg, it's Dan. I'll start. So look, 11.5% for ROE for a full year, pretty good number, another year, double digits, well above our cost of capital, and the risk-free rate, not quite where we'd like it to be. And I think the biggest contributor, and as you called out, Slide 7 is that yellow bar from the contribution from underwriting really impacted, as we talked about, especially in the second quarter and the third quarter by a very elevated level of catastrophe losses for the year.That's not what we expect to be the new normal run rate. We're certainly factoring more recent cat experience into our view of cat expectations going forward, but we wouldn't expect it to be elevated at that level."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Greg, it's Alan. The other thing I would add to that is I won't tell you would do, but one of the things I do every quarter is try to take a stab at normalizing these things. And so eliminate prior year development and put in for cats, whatever you think is a normalized cat number and then you get a different perspective."", 'Charles Gregory Peters', ""Right. Okay. And then Dan, I just wanted to go back to your comments about share repurchase and uses of capital. I know you talked about the expectation for what's going to happen in the first quarter, and you talked about capital. Are there any other things you'd like to call out in terms of capital allocation outside of dividends and share repurchase."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Let me start with that, and then I'll see what observations Dan has on that. So I think we've said for a very long time, our first objective for every dollar of capital we generate is to invest it back in the business when we think we can do that and achieve our objectives and contribute to shareholder value.But we think we've got a long track record that demonstrates our discipline with shareholders' capital. And so we're going to invest the money back in the business when we can and that could be keeping capital on the balance sheet to support profitable growth. It could be buying things like Corvus.It could be investing in technology or people doing the things that we think we can do that are accretive to our objectives. And when we can't do that, we're going to give the dollars back. So it's a long-winded way of saying no change at all in our capital management loss. Dan, (inaudible)."", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""I agree entirely. There's no hidden message in there, Greg. It's business as usual."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""My first question is on the Fidelis relationship. Dan, I think you called out and said you expect a modest favorable impact in 2024. Can you just give us a sense of how favorable that deal was to '23 margins within BI and how we should think about the year-over-year improvement you guys are expecting in '24 versus '23?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Sure, Elyse, it's Dan. So really not going to put a very fine number on it. Keep in mind now that Fidelis is now a stand-alone public company. They haven't reported results yet. I don't think it would be appropriate for us to give an outlook of what we felt about their profitability. But it was a modest help in 2023. It will be a modest help again in 2024.There'll be a little bigger base of earned premium as we'll have 2 years' worth of written impacting 2024. So worth calling out as a modest benefit, but not a big number, and I really don't think it would be appropriate for us to try to put a finer number on it than that."", 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', 'Okay. Then within personal auto, what percent of your states or premium still have non-rate restrictions in place.', 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Elyse, I don't think we'll get more specific than the majority, but you can think of the non-rate restrictions as tracking very closely with where we see written adequacy state by state. So the majority of the premium is in states where we have relaxed some of those or tempered some of those non-rate actions because the majority of premium is in states where we've got target returns on a written basis.And again, as I indicated in the -- in my prepared remarks, we'll continue to follow that path as more states get adequate will temper actions in those states as they reach adequacy."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research.', 'Ryan James Tunis', ""I guess my question is just looking at the rate slides. We saw an acceleration of pricing in middle market in select obviously, a decelerated headline. So I'm guessing that means there's deceleration in national property. Could you just, I guess, talk a little bit about the relative pricing dynamics in those 3 markets?"", 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""Ryan, it's Greg. Yes, you can see, if you look at underneath the price, and you can see rate is up in both the middle market and Select business. So the residual that makes up the total BI, you're correct, the preponderance of that is national property. And so a couple of dynamics this quarter in National Property One is when that plays out to the total book, we did have less weight on a net written premium national property this quarter, quarter 4 versus quarter 3 and quarter 2.And we did have a tick down overall in Rates national property also just given where the returns are in that business, and the business is performing extremely well."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', 'But make no mistake, Ryan, the overall rate change and renewal price change in the property line continues to be very strong.', 'Ryan James Tunis', ""Got it. And then just a follow-up. We're not used to seeing this type of margin expansion in business insurance. I would think that would mean that's largely attributable to short tail lines. But I guess I was also curious, obviously, Rate's been running an excessive onstream and casualties well for a while.We have been really talked about changing loss picks or anything like that. But was there a change on the casualty side to I guess, loss picks in the fourth quarter? Any true-up to the current year or something like that we should be aware of?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""No. Ryan, it's Dan. Like if we have an unusual item in the quarter that's sort of nonrun rate, we'll usually try and call it out for you, including some kind of year-to-date catch-up. Michael referred to it in PI auto, but you didn't hear Greg talk about anything significant in BI because there wasn't really anything significant in BI.So we do -- what we always do, right, go through all the lines there's puts and takes across every line, looking at frequency and severity. But on the whole, no big change in our view of blended trend."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO.', 'Michael David Zaremski', ""First question is maybe looking for a little bit more color on some of the pleasantly surprising commentary about the general liability and umbrella returns still being very good despite but someone else had pointed out, was 5 of the last 7 quarters adding to reserves. So just curious, is there any more -- can you elaborate on that business? Is that maybe you're taking into account the -- you don't typically hear that. Maybe it's the investment income that's helping or it's sold as part of a package. And so the rest of the products are running at better returns? Or anything you could add to that?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Mike, it's Dan. So we're thinking about the returns, and that is our all-in view of return, but we are specifically looking at those lines when we make that comment, although we do, to your point, also pay a lot of attention to returns on an account basis. But those comments were specific to the liability and umbrella lines. And this really goes back to the comment that Alan made a couple of quarters ago, which is -- the amounts that were, I'll say, tweaking prior year reserve development by is really pretty modest in the scope and the scheme of those reserves. And when we look at the total volume of business that we're writing and the returns on an over time basis, we still both like both of those lines very much."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Another way to think about it might be that you think about it in terms of rate adequacy and you might have an attractive rate adequacy, you might make an adjustment to it. It might be to one degree or another, slightly less rate adequate, nonetheless, you like the rate adequacy. So that's -- it's in that context, we say we continue to like to return in those lines."", 'Michael David Zaremski', ""Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, Alan, you continue to mention and show gauges of free cash flow. You also mentioned that it's -- I still don't think it's appreciated, at least I don't appreciate it why it's important. So maybe you can try to further elaborate on is it -- is the increase in cash flows, which I assume is correlated with your increased growth. Is that actually aiding your ROE? Or what are we -- why should we be focusing more on free cash flow, which has a lot of moving parts in it."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Yes. I wouldn't say it's just growth. It's a combination of profitable growth is what I would say about that. And as I've said, that I mean that's what gives us the flexibility to invest in all the important things we invest in, return capital to shareholders and grow the investment portfolio. So without strong free cash flow, we couldn't do those 3 things, and those are key to our operating model."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS.', 'Brian Robert Meredith', ""First question, if I look at the underlying combined ratio on your business insurance, it's, I believe, the best it's ever been since the St. Paul merger and public prior to that just on the numbers. I guess can you kind of talk a little bit about -- is that a sustainable kind of underlying combined ratio, underlying margin?Is there more improvement potentially can go there? At what point do you kind of say, okay, the margins we're seeing on the business are about as good as we should have and there maybe more focus on growth and more expenses and other things. How do you balance that?"", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""It's a really good question. And as you can imagine, I'm going to resist the temptation to try to share too much on an outlook of that number or what we might want to do strategically. Everything you mentioned is something we can think about. And I really would like to get away from talking about the future of margins.But we've answered that question before with loss trend where it is and pricing where it is. So you can conclude that answer hasn't really changed. So I think I'm just going to leave it with we really like these margins. We really like the business we're putting on the books at the margin we're putting it on the books and we really like the opportunity ahead of us."", 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""Brian, this is Greg. Just one follow-up. I would note you said you could grow the business. We are growing the business 16% on a full year basis and have strong new business. So there's a number of items that we watch and we compete in the marketplace, but growth is one of them through the lens of adequacy of our products."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Yes. And on that note, as I've shared before, we -- it's a full area in this industry to try to grow and compete on price. That's a losing proposition. we try to grow by making sure we've got the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell."", 'Brian Robert Meredith', ""Makes sense. And then, Michael, I'm just curious, back on personal auto. When you look at your business, the majority right now being, call it, rate adequate on a written basis, what are you kind of thinking from a loss cost in place in perspective? And is that maybe why you're not stepping on growth maybe a little bit quicker right now because of uncertainty as far as the claim severity?"", 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Sure, Brian. It's a great question. I would say that we continue to see loss trends moderate in personal auto but they remain at elevated levels. And so I guess I would describe our outlook as cautiously optimistic, and I would just say we're staying very disciplined, as I described earlier, with state-by-state execution, making sure we have our arms around written rate adequacy and then adjusting our marketplace actions in auto accordingly.And as I said, we're very pleased with the increase in new business production that we saw this quarter and policies in force stabilizing. And our plan is to continue down that path, achieve rate equity in additional states and for those non-rate actions as we go. and see what that does to the top line as we move forward."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW.', 'Meyer Shields', ""I was hoping for an update on what you're seeing in workers' compensation medical inflation. We've heard some comments about it moving back towards normalized levels and I'm wondering what Travelers experience is?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Meyer, it's Dan. So sure, a couple of comments on that. We do see some paid medical severity. That's now higher than what we saw in the very benign pandemic levels. On the flip side of that, frequency has been pretty favorable. And as you know, we've shared a number of times previously, our view in reserving and in pricing still assumes that there's going to be a return to that higher longer-term trend.But when we factor all that in, in the most recent data that we're looking at, loss costs still coming in better than we expected, and that's why you get another quarter of favorable PYD."", 'Meyer Shields', 'Okay. Fantastic. And then switching gears. When we look at the, I guess, the premium data in Business Insurance, it looks like exposure and other components that are not rates accelerated in select but decelerated in middle market and property. And I was hoping you could talk us through that.', 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""Meyer, this is Greg. We have a couple of dynamics going on between those 2 businesses. In Select, we have a higher exposure in workers' comp E&CMP. And for workers' comp relative to middle market, I think that it's just a different cohort of customers. So in a wage increase environment on a smaller customer base, you get bigger deltas and so that's what's driving the difference in workers' comp.CMP, similar to what Michael said, that's our business owner product with a heavy property coverage that comes with it in. So we do have to think of it as an automatic inflationary level underneath the CMP product, so you get a little more exposure to growth there also. So those are the drivers underneath the difference between select and middle."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.', 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""First one I had is on Business Insurance. And I was just interested in hearing a little bit about the competitive dynamic in the market. I mean I look at the returns, the underlying loss ratios are and so forth and the ROEs that suggests and yet price accelerating and in some areas, your business retention is actually hitting pretty darn high levels.So it also gets a lot of discipline in the marketplace. And -- just wanted to get your perspective on what is it in the environment that's causing everyone to remain so disciplined despite good underwriting and the additional contribution to net investment income."", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""Alex, it's Alan. Let me start and then I'll turn it over to Greg to add anything I missed. But I would say, overall, you're correct. The pricing environment remains very strong and broad-based by any historical standard or on any measure.And as you said, even with another quarter of very strong pricing, retention remains at historical highs. And I would say in broad strokes and there's really no change here from recent quarters. In broad strokes, I think there are 2 trends impacting pricing. On the one hand, there's just a lot of uncertainty out there in the world, and there's some headwinds.So the reinsurance market continues to be strong. You've got inflation of various varieties. You've got a tight labor market. I think weather is probably on everybody's minds, think about geopolitics these days, the world has never been more active than it is now and on and on. And so I can't speak for anybody else, but we're reacting to those things in our pricing.At the same time, we've had -- returns were in a much better place than they were a few years ago because we've done a pretty good job with pricing terms, conditions and all the rest. And so the pricing you see from us, and you referred to it as a competitive marketplace. I would say that it is a marketplace that is pretty disciplined. I suspect reacting to many of the things that we're reacting to. Greg, anything to add?"", 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""No, I think that's spot on."", 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""Got it. The second one I had is on personal auto. Can you just give us maybe a high-level idea of what's going on with severity in the claims, and we can look a lot at used cars and that kind of thing, but some of the more nuanced elements are on core repair and that kind of thing. Any color you can provide on some of those trends?"", 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Yes. Sure, Alex, it's Michael. Maybe just give a couple more comments relative to the comment I made earlier about moderating trends. You're right to point to sort of vehicle severity and used car prices, and we certainly see moderation there in the level of increase year-on-year. And in fact, when you look at the dynamics underneath the prior period adjustments that I described in the script, those really are driven by the physical damage coverages. Late last year, we were adding to our estimates for vehicle losses because physical damage coverages were rising more than we thought they were going to.And this year, we actually took down some of our estimates for vehicle severity on prior periods because they've been a bit more favorable than we anticipated. Broadly speaking, severity in auto is running mid- to high single digits, think closer to mid in the vehicle severity, think closer to high and bodily injury.And so that's sort of where trends are running today. We don't have a dramatic improvement in those trends sort of factored into our comments about when we're going to get to written adequacy state by state or those types of things, but that's a little bit more detail on sort of where things are running today.The other thing that we've mentioned a couple of quarters throughout the year is we are also monitoring the mix of losses between vehicle loss and losses that have third-party property damage and bodily injury. We've seen a bit of a mix shift towards more bodily injury claims, which is one of the things that has us keeping our severity trend estimates at that sort of elevated level."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.', 'Jon Paul Newsome', 'I want to follow directly on that maybe similar thoughts about the home part of the business, Michael.', 'Michael Frederick Klein', 'Sure. Just in terms of outlook for trans (inaudible)?', 'Jon Paul Newsome', 'Yes, please.', 'Michael Frederick Klein', ""Yes. So in property, again, the big driver of the improvement this quarter really was catastrophes and non-cat weather. The non-cat weather and I guess the non-weather loss dynamic that I would elaborate on is a lot of that non-cat weather favorability and some of the non-weather loss favorability that we've commented on throughout 2023, really has been frequency-driven.We do still see pretty healthy severity trends in the property space, offsetting some of that favorable frequency. Now again, we've had favorable results in the quarter. So the net is a good guy. But labor and some large loss pressure along with that favorable frequency is what's happening kind of underneath the loss levels in property."", 'Jon Paul Newsome', ""I'm just curious for some time, I think we've seen a little bit of a divergence between commercial auto and personal lines auto. Has that continued to be the case? Or are we seeing pretty similar claim trends in across sort of anything that drives?"", 'Alan David Schnitzer', ""I think broadly, the claim trends are similar. I mean we see similar threads. It's obviously -- I mean that the exposures are different. The size of the vehicles are different. Mike, what else would be the other, limits profile were different."", 'Michael Frederick Klein', 'Limits profile were different. Mix of vehicle versus bodily injury is different between business insurance and personal insurance, right, Greg?', 'Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski', ""Yes. I mean, one of the benefits, Paul, of having 2 large cohorts of auto business, commercial, auto, personal our product managers and actuaries spend a lot of time together and compare the trends. And for commercial, we'll have passenger -- private passenger, light vehicles, think Vans of that sort. And then we'll have heavies, which aren't as relevant, but we spend a lot of time on the 2 cohorts that are private passenger like and the trends are very similar, both on a frequency and severity basis between the 2 portfolios."", 'Operator', 'We have time for one more question. And that question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen.', 'Andrew Scott Kligerman', ""Question -- most of my questions are answered. But the -- in Bond & Specialty, the results looked exceptional. But in the context of renewal premium change, I'm very curious as to how pricing fared with regard to D&O and cyber in the quarter and what you're thinking in terms of those 2 lines going into 2024."", 'Jeffrey Peter Klenk', ""Yes. Andrew, this is Jeff Klenk. So relative to D&O and cyber, public D&O pricing continues to be, I'd say, more pressured relative to the other liability lines. I would remind you that for public D&O and our management liability book, we're relatively underweight there. That's not been a major area of focus for us. On the cyber side, we continue to see some modest negative pricing there. I think, given some broader market perception on the returns in the line. Again, we feel really good about our execution there. We closely monitor our return profiles and are comfortable with our execution, both for those lines of business and management liability problem."", 'Andrew Scott Kligerman', ""Got it. Great. And along the same lines in business insurance with regard to workers' comp, I was wondering if you could put some numbers around that paid medical severity higher than the benign numbers you were seeing during the pandemic. I think that was in response to Meyer's question. And then the same question on the pricing of workers' comp. What are you thinking about going into 2024 as you proceed?"", 'Daniel Stephen Frey', ""Andrew, it's Dan. So I'll start and disappoint you on the work comp severity. So we're not going to put a number on it. But again, it's been benign. We've seen some of those numbers move up, but your starting point matters. So what you assumed medical severity was going to be inside of your overall loss pick.Pick really matters in terms of whether a move-up is problematic for you or not. And again, we saw more favorable reserve development this quarter. And then in terms of pricing, and I'll turn it to Greg. I think the returns in comp have continued to be good. So pure rate has continued to be slightly negative for us. We are getting strong exposure increases, Greg referenced in the select comments a few minutes ago. that's the poster child for where a lot of that exposure behaves like rate because it's the same worker just earning a higher wage and we're getting paid a higher price for it. the rating agencies, the bureaus are looking at their data on a lagging basis. And until returns come under some pressure in work comp, we wouldn't be surprised to see this environment stay pretty steady."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein for closing remarks.', 'Abbe F. Goldstein', ""Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your time. And as always, if there's any follow-up, please feel free to reach out. Have a great day."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call.

Reported EPS is $2.81 EPS, expectations were $3.67. M&T Bank Corporation\xa0isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter\xa0(see the details here).', 'Operator: Welcome to the M&T Bank Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Market and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.', 'Brian Klock: Thank you, Michael and good morning. I’d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules by going to our website, www.mtb.com, once there, you can click on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.

The appropriate reconciliations to GAAP are included in the appendix. Joining me on the call this morning is M&T’s Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, Daryl Bible. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Daryl.', 'Daryl Bible: Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. As you will hear today on the call, 2023 mark a banner year for M&T Bank. On Slide 3, I want to acknowledge that the keys to our success to what continues to drive performance, remains our purpose, mission and operating principles. Our focus on making a difference in people’s lives and creating a positive impact in the communities we serve is core to how we operate. It is evident in how we show up for our communities in the moments of need like in Vermont and Lewiston, Maine, where we continue to help those impacted by tragedies. It is why we are committed to supporting small businesses that are the backbone of local economies. And it dictates how our charitable foundation which celebrated its 30th anniversary last year continues to uplift our partners.', 'It is all done alongside our daily work of helping our customers achieve their financial goals. Turning to Slide 4. We are excited to see how deeply we’ve embedded sustainability across the bank and into our products and services. I look forward to sharing more information on the impact of our businesses when we release our 2023 sustainability report in the spring. Now, let’s turn to Slide 6. As we reflect on 2023, there are several successes to highlight. We continue to realize the benefits from the People’s United franchise and are pleased with the growth in New England with M&T finishing as top SBA lender in Connecticut. C&I loans grew by over $5 billion or 11% in 2023, aided by the growth in several specialty businesses brought over by People’s United.', 'This C&I growth outpaced the reduction in CRE as we continue to optimize the way we serve these customers in the most capital-efficient manner possible. At the end of 2023, CRE loans represented approximately 25% of total loans. Our capital remains strong with a CET1 ratio near 11%. We continue to leverage our strong capital and liquidity levels to grow new customer accounts and relationships. We also reduced asset sensitivity in 2023 while protecting shareholder capital and value. However, our work is not done. We continue to recognize the value created by the merger with People’s United, while also bringing more capital efficient, neutral balance sheet that will produce stable and predictable revenue and earnings over the long term. Now, let’s review the highlights for the full year.', 'Results for the full year 2023 were strong. We generated positive operating leverage, solid loan growth, improved expense control through the year and growth in EPS and strong returns. Our pre-tax pre-provision revenue, or PPNR, was $4.2 billion, up 22% from 2022 and we generated 3.9% positive operating leverage. Net charge-offs were 33 basis points, in line with our expectations and long-term average. GAAP net income was $2.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $15.79, up 37% from the prior year. As a reminder, ‘22 results included merger charges, gain on sale of our insurance business, and a sizable contribution to our charitable foundation, while 2023 included gain on the sale of the CIT business and the FDIC special assessment. If you exclude these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $15.72 during 2023, up 11% compared to 2022.', 'Our adjusted returns were also very strong with return on assets of 1.33% and return on common equity of 11%. Turning to Slide 7, which shows the results of the fourth quarter were also strong. PPNR declined modestly from the linked quarter to just over $1 billion. C&I and consumer loan growth was strong. Expense control was evident as adjusted expenses declined 2% from the linked quarter and were down each consecutive quarter in 2023. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.74 for the fourth quarter. If we exclude the FDIC special assessment, adjusted diluted earnings per common share were $3.62. On an adjusted basis, M&T’s fourth quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.19% and 9.8%, respectively. Next, we will look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our fourth quarter results.', 'Please turn to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3% from linked quarter. This decline was driven by higher interest rates on customer deposit funding and changing deposit mix, partially offset by higher interest rates on earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.61%, down 18 basis points from the linked quarter. The primary drivers of the decrease to the margin were an unfavorable deposit mix shift contributing a negative 7 basis points, the impact of higher rates on customer deposit funding, net of the benefit from higher rates on earning assets contributing a negative 5 basis points and a negative 6 basis points for carrying additional liquidity on the balance sheet. Turning to Slide 9 to look at the average balance sheet trends.', 'Average investment securities were $27.5 billion, decreasing modestly during the fourth quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits at the Fed increased $3.5 billion to $30.2 billion. Due to our decision to have more liquidity on the balance sheet, this was mainly funded with strong deposit growth. Average loans increased slightly to $132.8 billion and average deposits grew $2 billion to $164.7 billion. Turning to Slide 10 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases increased slightly. Growth in C&I and consumer loans outpaced declines in CRE and residential mortgage loans. Growth in C&I loans were driven largely by dealer, fund banking and corporate and institutional businesses. Loan yields increased 14 basis points to 6.33% with higher yields across all loan categories.', 'Of note, the consumer loan yield increased 26 basis points as we continue to benefit from higher yields on new originations compared to yields on runoff balances. Turning to Slide 11. Our liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, investment securities and cash, including cash out at the Fed totaled $56.7 billion, representing 27% of total assets. The duration of the investment securities portfolio at the end of 2023 was about 3.7 years and the unrealized pretax loss and available-for-sale portfolio was only $251 million. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to focus on growing customer deposits, and we’re pleased with our growth in average deposits. Average deposits totaled grew $2 billion. Approximately 3/4 of that quarterly growth was from customer deposits.', 'Average demand deposits declined $3.8 billion, reflecting a continued shift toward higher-yielding products such as sweeps, on market savings and time to profits. The mix of average non-interest-bearing deposits was 30% of total deposits compared to 33% sequentially. Excluding broker deposits, the non-interest-bearing deposit mix in the fourth quarter was 33%. Encouragingly, we saw the pace of deposit cost increases slow through the quarter. Continue on Slide 13. Non-interest income was $578 million, up 3% sequentially. The increase was largely driven by a strong quarter for commercial mortgage banking revenues, growth and trust income and a small unrealized gain on certain equity securities. Other income also benefited from higher loan syndication fees.', 'The decrease in rates towards the end of the quarter drove the increase in commercial mortgage banking revenues. Turning to Slide 14. We continue to focus on controlling expenses. Non-interest expenses were $1.45 billion. Excluding the $197 million FDIC special assessment, non-interest expense were $1.25 billion, down 2% from linked quarter, and the adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.6%, largely unchanged from the third quarter. The decrease was driven by reductions in other expenses as a result of losses associated with certain retail banking activities in the linked quarter and lower merchant discount and credit card fees. The decrease in other expenses was partially offset by higher professional and other services. Salary and benefits decreased modestly from the third quarter as a result of lower average head count and seasonally lower benefit costs, partially offset by higher severance expenses.', 'Next, let’s turn to Slide 15 for credit. Full year net charge-offs totaled 33 basis points in line with our long-term historical average and expectations were set out earlier in 2023. Net charge-offs for the quarter totaled $148 million or 44 basis points, up 15 basis points over the linked quarter. This quarter’s increase was largely driven by 3 office-related charge-offs located in New York City, Boston and Washington, D.C. and 2 C&I charge-offs related to an online retailer and to an RV dealer. Non-accrual loans have trended down each consecutive quarter since the first quarter of 2023. That trend continued in the fourth quarter with non-accrual loans declining $176 million from linked quarter to $2.2 billion. The non-accrual ratio declined 15 basis points from the third quarter to 1.62%.', 'The decline was primarily driven by the transfer of certain loans to accrual, commercial payoffs and charge-offs on loans previously deemed non-accrual. Since the end of 2022, we have increased the allowance over $200 million, and the allowance to loan ratio was 13 basis points, ending 2023 at 1.59%. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a provision of $225 million compared to net charge-offs of $148 million. This resulted in an allowance build of $77 million this quarter and increased the allowance to loan ratio by 4 basis points. The current quarter build was primarily reflective of the commercial real estate values and higher interest rates contributing to modest deterioration in the performance of loans to commercial borrowers as well as loan growth in the C&I and consumer portfolios.', 'Turning to Slide 16. When we file our Form 10-K in a few weeks, we estimate that the level of criticized loans will be $12.6 billion compared to $11.1 billion at the end of September. We completed thorough reviews, covering more than 60% of all CRB loans, including maturities in the next 12 months, construction loans, watch loans and all criticized loans. The increase in criticized CRE loans was tied to these reviews and to 2024 maturities were the prospect of continued higher rates could negatively impact performance of the portfolios or create shortfalls in debt service coverage or require interest reserves for construction loans. The growth in criticized C&I loans was not tied to any specific review, but rather completion of an annual review cycle and our ongoing quarterly update upon receipt of interim financials.', 'Generally, our reviews do not incorporate any benefit of the forward curve at potentially lower interest rates. The 10 largest downgrades accounted for half of the total C&I downgrades and represented a range of industries. Common themes include pressures from higher interest rates and labor costs. During the fourth quarter, criticized non-owner-occupied C&I loans increased $663 million, accounting for 44% of the total increase in criticized loans. Criticized permanent CRE loans increased $441 million, representing 29% of the increase and criticized construction loans increased $375 million. Turn to Slide 17 and 18 for more details on the criticized loan portfolio. About 18% of the increase in criticized loans was driven by healthcare, 13% by multifamily and 9% are retail CRE loans.', 'Loan to values remain strong for these loan types ranging from low 50% range for retail, mid-50% range for multifamily and high 50% range for healthcare. To date, modifications at maturity have had sponsors generally support their loans through replenishment of reserves, loan pay-downs and enhanced recourse. That is why our credit size has not led to growth in non-accruals. Our conservative underwriting and strong client selection has been supportive of these assets. Reflective of the financial strength of the portfolio diversification of our CRE borrowers, 96% of criticized accrual loan balances and 53% of non-accruals loans are paying as agreed. Turning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T’s CET1 ratio at the end of 2023 was an estimated 10.98% compared to 10.95% at the end of the third quarter.', 'The increase was due in part to continued pause in repurchase in shares, combined with continued strong capital generation. At the end of December, the negative AOCI impact on CET1 ratio for available-for-sale securities and pension-related components would be approximately 20 basis points. Now turning to Slide 20 for outlook. First, let’s talk about the economic outlook. We see so-called soft landing scenario as having the highest probability, but the possibility remains for mild recession brought down by lagged impact of rate hikes from last year. We are encouraged to be continued strong performance by the consumer as continued drag gains as well as wage growth above inflation helped drive consumer spending. Consumer spending has slowed enough to alleviate inflation pressure for many goods and services.', 'We expect that to continue in 2024. Inflation figures remain above the Fed target of 2%, chiefly because of rents and home prices. While the prices of many consumer goods have fallen and inflation for consumer services has slowed. We expect weakness seen in rent listings to play through to the official inflation data in 2024 and helping to bring the headline inflation figures down. Our outlook incorporates the forward curve that has multiple 25 basis point Fed cuts in 2024. With that backdrop, let’s review our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable net interest income to be in the $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion range and net interest margin in the 350. This outlook reflects the impact of higher deposit funding costs and the impact of different interest rate scenarios.', 'As we have discussed, we continue to carry a high level of liquidity. Our current level of HQLA is about $46 billion, which is 2/3 in the cash and 1/3 in investment securities. In 2024, we started to shift some cash into securities. This, combined with other potential hedging actions can help protect the downside risk for NII from lower rates, but may reduce NII in 2024. We expect full year average loan and lease balances to be in the $135 billion to $136 billion range. We expect growth in C&I and consumer but anticipate declines in CRE and residential mortgages. Average deposits are expected to be in the $163 billion to $165 billion range. We are focused on growing customer deposits at a reasonable cost. The level of broker deposits is expected to decline through the year.', 'Turning to fees. We expect non-interest income to be in the $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion range. We expect solid fee income across many business lines. Lower rates will help drive stronger residential and commercial mortgage banking revenue Trust income is expected to grow from current levels from higher valuations and increasing clients. Turning to expenses. We anticipate non-interest expenses, including intangible amortization to be in the $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion range. This outlook includes our typical first quarter seasonal salary and benefit increase, which is estimated to be $110 million. We also included the outlook to be approximately $53 million for intangible amortization. Our business lines are focused on holding their expenses flat while allowing us to continue to invest in the franchise and our key priorities.', 'These priorities include growing the New England and Long Island markets, optimizing resources in both expense savings and revenue generation transferring our systems and processes, making them more resilient and scalable and continuing to build out our risk management. Turning to credit. We expect net charge-offs for the full year to be near 40 basis points due to the ongoing credit cost normalization in the loan portfolio and resolution of some stress credits. We expect that the taxable equivalent rate to be 24.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Finally, as it relates to capital, our capital, coupled with limited investment security works has been a clear differentiator for M&T. The strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary. We take our responsibility to manage our shareholders’ capital very seriously and will return more when it is appropriate to do that.', 'Our businesses are performing very well, and we are growing new relationships each and everyday. While every economic uncertainty is improving, our share repurchase remains on hold. Our decision to resume share repurchases will consider the results of the 2024 internal and supervisory stress test, including the stress test capital buffer. Additional clarity on Basel III end game regulations and continued stabilization and economic conditions as it relates to the probability of a mild recession. That said, we continue to use our capital for organic growth and growing new customer relationships. Buybacks have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and well again in the future. In the meantime, our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients, communities, regulators, investors and rating agencies.', 'On Slide 21, there is a summary of three enhancements we made to our financial reporting. First, we reclassified the substantial majority of owner-occupied loans and related interest income from CRE to C&I loans. This better aligns with the classification with the underlying management and repayment source of the loans. Second, in the upcoming 10-K we are changing our operating segments to reflect how management organizes its businesses to make operating decisions, allocate capital resources and assess performance. Third, as certain categories have started to attribute more or less to our expense base, we opted to include printing, postage and supplies and other costs and operations and break out professional and other services as a distinct line item in the income statement.', 'To conclude, on Slide 22, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. Why the economic uncertainty remains high, that is when M&T has historically outperformed peers. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperformance through all economic cycles while growing in the markets we serve. We remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth. Finally, we are disciplined, inquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital. Our integration of People’s United is complete, and we are confident in the ability to realize our potential post merger.

The company is expected to have witnessed sales and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.71 per share, indicating a 7.6% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For fiscal second-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $21.7 billion, suggesting a 4.3% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, the company recorded an earnings surprise of 7%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 3.8%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.', '\xa0', 'Procter & Gamble Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) Quote', ""Procter & Gamble has been demonstrating its dominance in the global market by strategically leveraging its brand strength to drive organic sales growth. As a manufacturer of products catering to the daily needs of consumers worldwide, P&G's success in the preceding quarters can be attributed to its robust brand portfolio and effective business strategies. The persistence of these trends is expected to get reflected in the company’s organic sales for the fiscal second quarter.We expect organic sales to increase 6% in the to-be-reported quarter. Organic sales are expected to increase 5% each for the Beauty, and the Baby, Feminine & Family Care; 8% each for Grooming and Health Care; and 6% for the Fabric & Home Care segment.P&G has been diligently pursuing cost-saving and productivity measures to drive margins and reinforce its competitive advantage. The company's commitment to enhancing productivity, while mitigating macro cost headwinds has been integral to maintaining a balanced top and bottom-line growth. Its focus on productivity and cost-saving plans are likely to have boosted margins in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect P&G's core gross margin for the fiscal second quarter to have been influenced by significant productivity savings. Our model predicts a core gross margin expansion of 190 bps for the to-be-reported quarter.\xa0However, currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have partly weighed on the fiscal second-quarter performance. Additionally, Procter & Gamble has been witnessing elevated SG&A expenses due to higher supply-chain costs, rising inflation and elevated transportation expenses.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected ongoing supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation to continue to impact consumer confidence throughout fiscal 2024. The persistence of these headwinds is likely to get reflected in the company’s bottom-line results to some extent.Our estimate indicates a 1.5% impact from currency headwinds in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, our estimate for core SG&A expenses of $5.4 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 6.9%. As a percentage of sales, core SG&A expenses are estimated to reflect a 50-bps expansion from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Consequently, our model suggests a 140-bps operating margin expansion to 24.4% for the fiscal second quarter."", 'Our proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Procter & Gamble this time around.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.4%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $4.88 billion, up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Colgate-Palmolive?', ""For Colgate-Palmolive, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.78%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Colgate-Palmolive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Colgate-Palmolive would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.86, delivering a surprise of +7.50%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Colgate-Palmolive appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.', 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', ""Among the stocks in the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, Procter & Gamble (PG) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.71 per share for the quarter ended December 2023.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.', ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares."", ' Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals ', ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Dale Asplund, for US$6.7m worth of shares, at about US$475 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$572. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign.

It has achieved a great deal of success of late, which understates just how well the business has been performing. And yet investors have soured on the shares since their price hit a high-water mark in 2022.', 'If you have $200 to invest, strongly consider buying Prologis stock and holding it for a very long time, perhaps forever.', 'At its core, Prologis is a very boring REIT. It largely owns warehouses, which are basically just big empty boxes. What makes the company so attractive for customers is not the boxes, but the location of the boxes. It operates in all of the most important transportation hubs in the world. So with one relationship, a company could pretty much solve all of its warehouse needs.', ""Then there's the size of the company. It operates 1.2 billion square feet of warehouse space across 5,500 buildings located in 20 countries. And management believes it has another $40 billion worth of properties it can build on vacant land it owns. There are no other publicly traded warehouse landlords that come close to that mark."", ""That is one of the reasons why the REIT has a market cap of $120 billion. The interesting thing about that number isn't that it is large for a warehouse REIT -- it is large for any REIT at all. An investment in Prologis is an investment in a recognized industry leader. Add in an investment-grade-rated balance sheet\xa0and, despite the stock decline, Prologis looks like a fairly safe option in the REIT sector."", ""Being big isn't enough to make a stock worth buying on its own. And given the stock price decline, it pays to ask what is going on at the business that has investors so worried."", ""The answer is nothing. For example, Prologis was able to increase rents on expiring leases by a whopping 84% in the third quarter. Occupancy was a very strong 97.1%. This is not a business that is struggling, though it would be fair to suggest that it can't keep up this level of performance forever."", ""And yet Prologis doesn't see anything on the horizon that suggests its business is going to fall off a cliff. Construction starts are reasonable and demand for existing assets remains strong, hinting that rent growth and occupancy will be resilient in the years ahead, even if results aren't quite as robust as they have been of late. The big change is likely in how investors view the company's prospects, not the company's actual prospects."", ""Indeed, when supply was particularly tight Wall Street jumped into the warehouse space. And now, despite results that have remained strong, investors have moved on to the next big thing. Yes, growth is likely to slow from here. But when you add in the company's dominant industry position, the access to capital markets it has because of its size, and the built-in growth it has due to its large portfolio of vacant land, there's still a lot about Prologis to like."", ""Despite the investor enthusiasm that drove up Prologis' share price, it was never an exciting company. It is the kind of REIT that does one thing and does it exceptionally well. Which is why, with the stock still down so much, it is a great buy-and-hold investment option. You won't brag to your friends about owning it, but as it continues to raise rents up to market rates and build out new assets when demand is there, this giant company will continue to grow. And you can take advantage of that long-term growth with as little as $200."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prologis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prologis, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Prologis wasn't one of them.

However, one strategy has delivered them with a fair degree of consistency over the years: investing in dividend stocks, specifically dividend growers and initiators.

Two top options to consider investing in right now are Prologis (NYSE: PLD) and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIP)(NYSE: BIPC). They have a long history of growing their payouts and delivering market-beating returns, which seems likely to continue in the future. Because of that, they could help provide your portfolio with the secret sauce needed to generate above-average total returns.', ""Prologis is the leading industrial real estate investment trust (REIT). The company's global warehouse portfolio generates growing rental income to support its rising dividend. The REIT has increased its payouts at a 12% compound annual rate over the last five years, twice as fast as the S&P 500's average. It also offers an above-average yield (currently 2.7% compared to 1.5% for the S&P 500). Prologis' rapidly rising payout has helped drive it to market-beating total returns over the last five years (an annualized rate of 18.7% compared to 14.3% from the S&P 500). "", 'The warehouse operator is in an excellent position to continue growing its dividends at an above-average pace. Management estimates rent growth should drive 7.5% to 8.5% annual net operating income growth through 2026. Add in growth from development projects, and the REIT should grow its core funds from operations (FFO) at an annualized rate of 9% to 11% during that timeframe. Meanwhile, Prologis has further upside potential from acquisitions, which have historically added about 1.5% to its core FFO per share each year. Those growth drivers could enable the REIT to increase its dividend by around a double-digit percentage rate over the next few years. The combination of earnings growth and rising income should help Prologis produce double-digit percentage total annual returns. ', ""Brookfield Infrastructure is a leading infrastructure operator. Its global portfolio of utilities, pipelines, ports, and data centers generates steadily rising income backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures. That supports the company's 4.4%-yielding payout. Brookfield has grown its dividend at an 8% compound annual rate over the last decade. That has helped fuel a 12.5% annualized total return during that period, outpacing the S&P 500's 12.1% annualized total return. "", 'The company is in a strong position to continue outperforming. It has a trio of organic drivers (inflation-linked rate increases, volume growth, and development projects) that should support annual FFO-per-share growth of 6% to 9%. Meanwhile, the company has an active capital recycling program (selling mature businesses and reinvesting the proceeds into higher-returning new investments). That strategy has historically helped drive its annual FFO-per-share growth into double-digit percentages. Those drivers should give it the fuel to achieve its long-term targets of increasing its dividend by 5% to 9% annually and delivering total annual returns in the 12% to 15% range. ', 'Investing in dividend growth stocks can give investors a leg up in their efforts to earn above-average returns. That has certainly been the case for those who have invested in Prologis and Brookfield Infrastructure over the years.

However, with the recent numbers showing that inflation is that dinner party guest that is overstaying its welcome, you may not want to dismiss income-generating stocks too quickly.', 'Now, if you’re still with me, I’ll also say that this I’m not recommending that you find the dividend stocks with the highest dividend yields and be done with it.', 'While high-yield dividend stocks are attractive, they’re only one part of a stock’s total return. Not only do you want to ensure that a company’s dividend is safe (and preferably growing), but you also want to buy shares of a company that are going to deliver reasonable capital gains to go along with that dividend.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Of course, if you’re looking to own stocks for the long haul, you’re going to have to deal with a bad year here and there. But over time, owning quality high-yield dividend stocks is a solid strategy for building wealth.', 'Companies that pay dividends are often blue-chip companies that are at a mature stage in their business cycle. This means they deliver predictable, some may say boring, revenue and earnings. But boring can quickly become beautiful when it’s time for those dividends to be paid.', 'Here are seven overlooked high-yield dividend stocks for you to consider in 2024.', 'Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com', 'This isn’t the first time I’ve recommended Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and it may not be the last. PFE stock is a no-go for many investors based on reasons that have nothing to do with the company’s fundamentals. Fair enough, every investor needs to know where their line is.', 'And from a total return standpoint, Pfizer has been a tough hold. The stock is down 38.9% in the last 12 months. The reason is simple. The record revenue and earnings per share (EPS) growth the company saw in 2021 and 2022 has normalized. Faced with tougher comps in 2023, Pfizer couldn’t deliver.', 'But the company reported 7% growth in revenue from its non-Covid products in the third quarter. And, Pfizer projects full-year revenue growth for those products between 6%-8%.', 'Beyond its current portfolio, Pfizer has a strong pipeline backed by $7.9 billion in internal reserarch and development spending. The pipeline includes many drugs and therapeutics centered around the concept of precision medicine, which focuses on the biological basis of diseases.', 'Pfizer is expected to post 45% earnings growth in the next 12 months. Still PFE stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18x. Investors also get a dividend that has been growing for 14 consecutive years and has\xa0a juicy 5.91% yield.', 'Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com', 'Next on this list of overlooked high-yield dividend stocks is Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). One reason why the company may be overlooked is that it’s in the category of equities loosely labeled sin stocks. ', 'As you consider the bullish case for Philip Morris, think to the electric vehicle (EV) industry. While this industry has its startups, the legacy automakers weren’t going to allow this threat to their business to emerge without getting a seat at the table. ', 'In the same way, Philip Morris is a key player in the smokeless tobacco categories. Traditional nicotine products continue to have a place in the company’s portfolio. But an increasing amount of revenue is coming from smoke-free products. In its third quarter 2023 earnings report, that category was responsible for 36% of the company’s revenue.', 'That’s why no matter how you look at it, or disagree with it, Philip Morris is an exceptional defensive stock. PM stock is down 7% in the last 12 months, but analysts are expecting a 15% recovery in the company’s share price. And investors get a juicy dividend that currently yields 5.50% and has increased for 16 consecutive years. ', 'Source: Giovanni Nastukov / Shutterstock.com', 'Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) is the former consumer products division of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The company formally spun off from J&J in May and began publicly trading at that time. The early returns have been underwhelming with the stock down 18%.', 'Nevertheless, Kenvue represents the most defensive sector of its former parent company’s portfolio with brand names like Band-Aid, Listerine, and Tylenol. Those popular brands are\xa0literally household names and staple items in medicine cabinets.', 'But should you buy the stock? Earnings are expected to be flat to slightly lower. But analysts have a sense that the sell-off may be overdone. They assign KVUE stock with a $24.27 consensus price target which is 10% higher than the price as of this writing. ', 'And then there’s the dividend which currently has a yield of 3.65%. For now, ratings agencies are giving Kenvue a halo effect from Johnson & Johnson. The stock gets mostly ‘A’ ratings as analysts expect that Kenvue management won’t depart from J&J’s emphasis on the dividend. ', 'Source: LesPalenik / Shutterstock.com', 'The fall rally in oil prices reversed sharply in the last two months of 2023, and with it went the share price of oil stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX). The energy sector in general disappointed investors in 2023. In fact, CVX stock earned the dubious distinction of being one of the Dogs of the Dow in 2023. ', 'To be fair, there are many factors that can impact the direction of oil prices. However, despite the state of interest rates, oil prices have been ticking higher. If the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, for whatever reason, it will be exceptionally bullish for oil. ', 'But won’t that just be a rising tide that lifts all oil stocks? The experts are projecting earnings per share for companies in the oil and gas industry will rise at an average rate of 6.3% for the next 12 months. However, Chevron is expected to grow earnings by over 16% and analysts give CVX stock a consensus price target of $177.61 which is a 22% gain. ', 'In addition to that sector-beating performance, Chevron is a dividend aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 36 consecutive years. The dividend currently has a yield of 4.16%.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) clocks in with a dividend yield of 4.07%. And in 2023, that was the only comfort that investors got from owning UPS stock. Shares of the delivery giant are down 11.5% in the last 12 months. The company faced tough comparisons to 2022. A labor dispute didn’t help matters as some customers took their business elsewhere. ', 'But the stock has been trending higher along with the broader market. The company has taken cost-cutting measures and is projecting earnings growth of over 6.8% in the next 12 months. Analysts give the share price about a 5% upside. And on Jan. 10, Stifel Nicolaus reiterated its Buy rating on the stock while bumping its price target to $190. ', 'That’s more exciting. However, for UPS Stock to hit that number, you’re betting on the consumer to stay strong. The December CPI number showed that inflation won’t go quietly, but it also provides some evidence that the consumer continues to spend. ', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'Many growth investors will continue to buy the Magnificent 7 stocks in 2024. That includes stocks like Nvidia (NYSE:NVDA) which may continue to be a great stock.', 'But as Josh Enomoto explained to InvestorPlace readers, Nvidia may be many things, but it’s not part of the overlooked high-yield dividend stocks club. So,\xa0if you’ve stuck with me to this point, you may find International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) to be an interesting choice.', 'One reason for that is, ironically, AI. Many investors don’t realize that IBM has been involved in the area of machine learning long before ChatGPT caught the attention of students across the globe. And the company’s recent announcement of its Quantum System Two computer has the opportunity to leap frog the company into a prominent position in the AI space.', 'That being said, IBM is the only stock on this list that is forecast to have a lower stock price in the next 12 months. But with a dividend that yields over 4% you get a nice benefit while you wait on the stock to move higher. ', 'Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock', 'For many investors, finding high-yield dividend stocks means looking at monthly dividend payers. And that means real estate investment trusts (REITs). Armour Residential REIT (NYSE:ARR) is one of the more intriguing names to look for in 2024. ', 'But it’s not without risk. The company is a mortgage REIT (mREIT) that’s primary revenue is derived from buying government agency securities on people’s mortgages. The environment for mREITs has been terrible to say the least as interest rates have moved higher because the value of existing loans – the kind that Armour buys – is lower.', 'Thomas Niel explains why the company’s current dividend yield of over 24% may not be sustainable. But REITs are still required to pay at least 90% of their earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. In 2023, the amount the company is paying in dividends still exceeds the company’s net loss on paper.', 'That may be a simplistic way of looking at things, but when you’re considering investing in a REIT, it’s all about the dividend.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' See our latest analysis for Tractor Supply ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Tractor Supply's EPS has grown 17% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about."", ""Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Tractor Supply remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 9.9% to US$15b. That's a real positive."", ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image."", ""You don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Tractor Supply's future profits."", ""Since Tractor Supply has a market capitalisation of US$25b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. With a whopping US$57m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth."", ""While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Tractor Supply, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m."", ""Tractor Supply's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$10m in the year leading up to December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense."", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Tractor Supply's strong EPS growth. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that Tractor Supply is worth keeping an eye on. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for Tractor Supply that you need to take into consideration."", 'Although Tractor Supply certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Ulta Beauty’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty ', 'According to our valuation model, Ulta Beauty seems to be fairly priced at around 9.1% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ulta Beauty today, you’d be paying a fair price for it.

Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Ulta Beauty’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy.

The company focuses on diseases that have been historically underserved by the medical community at large.', ""The company's current portfolio revolves around four cystic fibrosis medicines, all of which belong to a class of drugs called CFTR modulators. These four drugs are the only ones that have been commercialized to date that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, so demand for Vertex's products is not only high but consistent. These medications generally require two doses daily, and are an essential part of patients' lives."", ""Vertex's top-selling drug is Trikafta, which at the time of its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2019 covered roughly 90% of all cystic fibrosis patients in the U.S. This drug brought in $6.6 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2023 alone, out of Vertex's total revenue for that period of $7.4 billion. And despite the market-leading success of Vertex's cystic fibrosis drug franchise, management has said that there are over 20,000 eligible patients in North America, Europe, and Australia who could benefit from these medicines but aren't taking them yet."", ""Vertex is working on building out a portfolio that spans many rare disease drug areas, with the latest move on that front being the approval of its gene-editing therapy Casgevy (also known as exa-cel). Casgevy is designed to serve as a one-time functional cure for both sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT). Both of these diseases are characterized by severe issues with a patient's hemoglobin and require regular blood transfusions. Not only can these blood disorders cause significant pain for patients, but both can lead to a host of other dangerous and potentially deadly physical complications."", ""Casgevy was developed in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics and became the first-ever gene editing therapy to garner regulatory approval. The therapy is made by taking the patient's own blood stem cells, editing them to produce elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin, and infusing them back into the patient. Patients must undergo chemotherapy to prep or condition their cells for the therapy, and a lengthy recovery process. Casgevy has been approved for qualifying patients with SCD and TDT in the U.S., U.K., and Saudi Arabia, and is currently pending approval in the E.U., which recently recommended conditional authorization for both indications."", ""One of multiple promising pipeline candidates that current and prospective Vertex investors should watch is VX-548, the company's non-opioid treatment for various acute pain ailments. The treatment just garnered positive results in a phase 2 study for use in patients who suffer from diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a condition that affects roughly half of all diabetes patients at some point in their lives."", ""Vertex still looks to be in the very early stages of its growth story, with a runway of expansion ahead through existing and new therapies in its portfolio. Now may be a wise time to consider a position in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which is already up 40% over the trailing 12 months, double the S&P 500's performance in that same period."", ""Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) has gone through its fair share of struggles in a market that is tired of growth stocks in the aftermath of the worst of the pandemic, and where fears of a recession have pulled many businesses fueled by discretionary spending further downward. With the stock trading down by about 50% over the last 12 months alone, it's fair to say that it hasn't been an easy time to be an Etsy shareholder."", ""General market sentiment hasn't been the only reason behind Etsy's drop. The company has dealt with a notable slowdown in growth, bouts of unprofitability, and changes in both the numbers of active buyers and sellers on its platform in past quarters. While some of the unfavorable growth patterns derive from poor comparisons to heightened levels of growth at the peak of the pandemic, it's important to understand the backdrop that has fueled Etsy's performance in preceding quarters."", 'Etsy has undertaken multiple steps to drive operational efficiency.

Here's why they picked CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO)."", ""David Jagielski (CRISPR Therapeutics): One stock that I don't expect to slow down this year is CRISPR Therapeutics. Last year, shares of CRISPR surged 54%. Fresh off the approval of its first gene-editing therapy, Casgevy, there could be more reasons to remain bullish on the biotech stock in 2024."", 'Earlier this month, CRISPR and its development partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals\xa0obtained approval for Casgevy to treat transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. In December, the therapy was approved for sickle cell disease.', ""Analysts at Goldman Sachs project that revenue from Casgevy could top $3.9 billion at its peak. Even though CRISPR will share in the profits on Casgevy, with CRISPR collecting 40% of the earnings (Vertex will take 60%), the commercialization and rollout for Casgevy could drastically improve CRISPR's financial outlook. Over the trailing 12 months, the company has incurred net losses totaling $354 million."", 'There could be more catalysts beyond that for CRISPR. Later this year, the company also plans to provide updates for a couple of next-generation CAR-T product candidates in its portfolio. Positive updates from those products could help lift shares of CRISPR even higher.', ""The stock has fallen since it obtained regulatory approval for Casgevy as a treatment for sickle cell disease. This could be a sign that investors are cashing out. However, I suspect that it won't be too long before the stock begins to rally again."", ""Keith Speights (Eli Lilly): Eli Lilly's shares have skyrocketed close to 75% over the last 12 months. In the process, the company dethroned Johnson & Johnson\xa0as the biggest drugmaker in the world based on market cap. I don't think Lilly's stellar run is anywhere close to being over."", ""For one thing, the company's weight-loss drug Zepbound is just getting started. Lilly won U.S. regulatory approval for the drug in November 2023."", ""Based on early prescription trends, it's already gaining significant market share. Some analysts predict that Zepbound and Mounjaro, Lilly's type 2 diabetes drug based on the same active ingredient, will combine to generate peak annual sales of more than $50 billion."", 'Mounjaro has already proved to be a spectacular success in treating type 2 diabetes. Lilly reported the drug had nearly $3 billion in sales during the first nine months of 2023.', 'The big pharma also has other major growth drivers in its current lineup. Sales for breast cancer drug Verzenio soared 68% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. Jardiance, which is approved for treating type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, kept up its momentum with sales jumping 22%. Sales for autoimmune-disease drug Olumiant vaulted 27% higher.', ""Two of Lilly's newer cancer drugs, Retevmo and Tyvyt, are also gaining traction with sales rising by 56% and 50%, respectively, in the third quarter."", ""Lilly could soon have yet another big winner on the market. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expects to make an approval decision on donanemab in treating early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease later in the first quarter of 2024. If approved, analysts think the drug could achieve annual sales of $6 billion by 2026."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Novo Nordisk): Denmark-based Novo Nordisk was unstoppable in 2023. The drugmaker's financial results were excellent, the company reported meaningful clinical progress, and it even helped its home country's economy soar."", ""There's no secret behind Novo Nordisk's recent success. The company is a leader in the market for weight loss drugs, an area that has risen in popularity in recent years. Ozempic has become known as an off-label drug for weight loss, so much so that Novo Nordisk has had trouble meeting demand."", 'And last year was just the beginning. The anti-obesity market is projected to skyrocket through the end of the decade. That will provide a significant tailwind to Novo Nordisk.', 'The biotech should also benefit from more clinical and regulatory progress. Last year, semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and its siblings, Rybelsus and Wegovy) aced a clinical trial targeting kidney disease in diabetes patients.', ""The medicine could earn major label expansions. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk could win approval for icodec, a once-weekly insulin product, this year. Beyond its core therapeutic areas of diabetes and obesity care, the company has made a conscientious effort to develop medicines in other fields, including Alzheimer's, sickle cell disease, and more."", ""What does all this mean for investors? Though the company's performance last year was great, it should keep its momentum going through 2024 and perhaps even outdo its showing from 2023."", ""More importantly, Novo Nordisk's long-term prospects look great, so whether or not it crushes the market again this year, investors can safely hold on to the stock for the long haul."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Novo Nordisk right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Novo Nordisk, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Novo Nordisk wasn’t one of them.

I'm afraid, though, that several members of the new group are unlikely to do so in 2024."", ""Walgreens Boots Alliance recently slashed its dividend by nearly half. Although its current dividend yield of 4.4% would still enable the stock to make the Dogs of the Dow list, the dividend cut highlighted serious business challenges for the pharmacy retailer and wholesaler.

After all, these companies sometimes control more than $100 billion in wealth, making them major players in the stock market."", 'The biggest hedge fund in the world today is Bridgewater Associates, which has around $200 billion in assets under management. Bridgewater was founded in 1975 by Ray Dalio, and has grown exponentially over the years. It was one of the few hedge funds to emerge as a winner during the great financial crisis in 2008, and Dalio tends to focus his investing strategy on macroeconomics, following the direction of the economy rather than the behavior of individual companies.', ""Though Dalio is no longer involved with Bridgewater on a day-to-day basis, the fund still attracts a lot of attention. Bridgewater's two biggest holdings are ETFs, the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. Notably, its top five individual stock holdings as of its third quarter are all big-brand consumer staples stocks that investors use every day. Let's take a look at each one."", ""Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) may be the best consumer defensive stock you can find on the market. The company is nearly 200 years old and has around 20 brands that generate $1 billion or more a year in revenue. P&G's strong position in products like diapers, shampoo, razors, paper products, and more makes it virtually recession-proof, and the company also has a long history of raising its dividend, rewarding investors.

Those include Minute Maid, Fanta, Powerade, Costa Coffee, and a minority stake in Monster Beverage.', 'Coca-Cola also has a long track record of raising its dividends and the company benefits from a range of competitive advantages, including its well-known brands, distribution network, and its marketing muscle. While soda consumption may be on a slow decline, Coca-Cola has been diversifying beyond just traditional sodas.', 'Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is one of the biggest retailers in the world and another classic defensive stock. Not only is the company known for rock-bottom prices on its merchandise, but it also locks customers in through its membership model. In fact, the company makes most of its profits from membership fees.', ""That makes the stock a smart investment during recessions as members aren't likely to quit the service.\xa0Costco also recently paid a special dividend of $15 per share in December, and Bridgewater may have been holding the stock to take advantage of that."", 'PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) offers many of the same benefits as Coca-Cola, but with the added diversification that comes from its food business.

Its reputation for low prices and its strength with low- to middle-income customers also make it a recession-proof stock.', ""Bridgewater seems to be taking a defensive position in the market, preparing for a potential recession by investing in dividend-paying, recession-proof stocks. Dalio also recently advocated holding cash, a sign he believes it's worth taking a conservative stance in the market at the moment."", ""That doesn't mean that the stock market is headed for a recession, but understanding how the biggest investors are approaching the current market situation can help inform your own investing decisions."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them.

The persistence of these trends is expected to get reflected in the company’s organic sales for the fiscal second quarter.We expect organic sales to increase 6% in the to-be-reported quarter.

That's easier said than done, of course, but two stocks that seem to fit the bill today are UDR (NYSE: UDR) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD)."", ""Here's a quick look at each and why you might want to put $1,000 into these stocks right now."", 'Most property markets go through cycles like this: Supply is low so rental rates rise, new construction comes in to take advantage of high prices, excess supply pressures rental rates, and construction dries up, leading right back to low supply. It is a fairly predictable cycle, complicated by the fact that building properties generally take a long time. As an apartment landlord, real estate investment trust (REIT) UDR is most concerned with multi-tenant residential properties. Looking at the cycle outlined above, new supply is starting to push rental prices lower.', ""That's bad news, and it will linger for at least another year given the construction lag, but new construction beyond that is likely to start to fall. That said, UDR still had to lower its full-year 2023 guidance when it reported third-quarter earnings. Investors don't like that sort of thing, as you might expect, and the shares are now more than a third below their 2022 peak. The dividend yield is 4.3%, near its highest levels over the past decade."", ""But there's a lot to like about UDR's business. For starters, there's no reason to believe it will be unable to muddle through this property cycle given that it has muddled through many such cycles before. It is also one of the most diversified apartment landlords you can buy, with properties spread across the United States in both urban and suburban markets, and in both high-end and mid-level assets. Oh, and everyone needs a place to live, so the demand for apartments isn't going away. If you have $1,000, you should consider putting some of it into UDR."", ""Shifting gears into banking, Toronto-Dominion Bank (aka TD Bank) hasn't been hitting on all cylinders of late. Rising interest rates have put pressure on the banking business. That's an industry-wide issue in banking, as higher interest costs can lead to a reduction in demand for key products (mortgages) and an increase in non-payment of loans. TD Bank has been through cycles like this before, though, so there's no reason to expect it to fail miserably this time around."", ""However, the bank recently had to scuttle a deal to buy a smaller rival in the United States. That happened because regulators were concerned about TD Bank's anti-money laundering practices. There's likely to be a fine, and TD Bank will have to regain regulator trust before it will be allowed to grow via acquisition in the U.S. market again. That's a self-inflicted wound. The stock is down around 30% from recent highs."", ""That said, the dividend yield is an attractive 5% or so, which is near the high end of the range over the past decade. And the company's financial position is quite strong, with a Tier 1 capital ratio -- a measure of a bank's ability to handle adversity -- that's the second best in North America. Yes, there are problems to deal with. But the problems are unlikely to derail the company or even its growth. Notably, it opened 18 new locations in the United States in the fiscal fourth quarter. If you can sit tight while TD Bank works through the industry's weak patch and its company-specific ills, you'll likely be well rewarded."", ""If you have $1,000 to invest but are worried that the market has gotten away from you after the big rally to end 2023, think again. You just have to be more selective. UDR and TD Bank are both well-run companies with long histories of success behind them. Yes, the problems they face will take some time to resolve, but it is highly likely they will be resolved and the stocks will return to favor on Wall Street. Don't be afraid to buy today, collect their dividends, and wait for better days."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Toronto-Dominion Bank right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Toronto-Dominion Bank, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Toronto-Dominion Bank wasn't one of them.

The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.
