It has amassed assets over $5.86 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap ValueWith more potential comes more risk, and small cap companies, with market capitalization below $2 billion, epitomizes this way of thinking.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.49%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 18.80% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG) accounts for about 0.46% of total assets, followed by First Citizens Bancshares Inc Clas (FCNCA) and Patterson Uti Energy Inc (PTEN).The top 10 holdings account for about 3.42% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskFNDA seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.The ETF has lost about -12.43% so far this year and is down about -13.56% in the last one year (as of 11/18/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.52 and $56.82.The ETF has a beta of 1.18 and standard deviation of 31.12% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 983 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FNDA is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and the Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF (VBR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $12.42 billion in assets, Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF has $24.13 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VBR charges 0.07%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

1,8a05574f-6ec6-3a82-9db5-5b13c29637ef,SCHW,2022-11-18,Investing in Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) five years ago would have delivered you a 81% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-charles-schwab-nyse-schw-110030756.html,1668769230,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) share price is up 70% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 44% (ignoring dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Charles Schwab achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Charles Schwab, it has a TSR of 81% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Charles Schwab returned a loss of 3.6% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 21%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Charles Schwab better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Charles Schwab is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Charles Schwab is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

In one of his recent interviews with Fox Business, he asserted that loan growth in the US is robust this year despite inflation. He further mentioned that year-over-year loan growth has reached 11.5%, which indicates that the US economy is unlikely to fall into recession as of now.

The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,109,194,000Dividend Yield as of November 16: 1.13%The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American multinational financial services company that offers banking and other related services. The company is one of the latest holdings of Fisher Asset Management. The hedge fund opened its position in the company with over 15.4 million shares, worth over $1.1 billion. The company represented 0.83% of billionaire Ken Fisher's portfolio. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is another prominent holding of Ken Fisher in Q3.On October 26, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with its previous dividend. The company raised its dividends twice this year, after ceasing dividend growth during the pandemic.

These stakes have a total value of over $4.5 billion.LVS Advisory mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We purchased shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) around the same time as Interactive Brokers. The investment thesis is similar. Schwab benefits from higher interest rates as it collects income earned from client cash. While IBKR mostly serves retail investors, Schwab has a greater emphasis on wealth advisors and corporate retirement plans. B2B channels are sticker than retail traders and give Schwab pricing power to collect a greater portion of the interest earned than IBKR. Schwab is a more mature business and has fewer reinvestment opportunities than IBKR (which is why I prefer IBKR on the margin); however, Schwab has authorized a massive $15 billion share buyback program (!) representing over 10% of the company’s market cap at the time of announcement. Given that Schwab trades for a mid-teens price-to-earnings multiple and has a low cost of capital, the share buyback should be highly accretive. The combined tailwind from higher interest rates and the buyback program will lead to attractive earnings per share growth over the coming years.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

(NYSE:TMO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is the world’s largest life sciences tools company. Shares fell due to the rotation out of life sciences tools stocks, driven by concerns about a possible global recession, foreign currency exposure, COVID-related lockdowns in China, and reduced levels of biotechnology funding. We continue to believe Thermo Fisher has a strong long-term growth outlook given a large and growing addressable market coupled with its industry-leading scale, commercial infrastructure, e-commerce platform, supply-chain capabilities, and R&amp;D investment.”8.

We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,203,823,000Dividend Yield as of November 16: 0.68%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American company that operates an international chain of membership warehouses.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”6.

The bottom line reflects a rise of 38.5% from the prior-year quarter.Results were primarily aided by an improvement in revenues. Also, the capital position remained strong. However, higher expenses and a fall in DARTs were headwinds.After considering non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $99 million or 97 cents per share, up from $42 million or 43 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Interactive Brokers reported comprehensive income available to common shareholders of $69 million or 68 cents per share compared with $33 million or 34 cents in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal GAAP net revenues were $790 million, up 70.3% year over year.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Crocs (CROX). CROX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 9.04 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 12.53.

This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. CROX's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 19.22.

13,fcb1b32a-e7ea-367b-8b4f-d2dbd538325c,PVH,2022-11-18,Positive earnings growth hasn't been enough to get PVH (NYSE:PVH) shareholders a favorable return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-earnings-growth-hasnt-enough-142659024.html,1668695219,STORY,['PVH'],"[PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 20% in the last month. But that can't change the reality that over the longer term (five years), the returns have been really quite dismal. In that time the share price has delivered a rude shock to holders, who find themselves down 56% after a long stretch. So we're not so sure if the recent bounce should be celebrated. However, in the best case scenario (far from fait accompli), this improved performance might be sustained.On a more encouraging note the company has added US$602m to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the five-year loss for shareholders. See our latest analysis for PVH In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, PVH actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 22% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.We don't think that the 0.3% is big factor in the share price, since it's quite small, as dividends go. The revenue fall of 1.4% per year for five years is neither good nor terrible. But it's quite possible the market had expected better; a closer look at the revenue trends might explain the pessimism.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. You can see what analysts are predicting for PVH in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that PVH shareholders are down 51% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.PVH is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

14,91ce3cae-8c5b-3003-bd99-ac8224028d07,TMO,2022-11-18,Investors in Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) have made a impressive return of 178% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-110109400.html,1668769269,STORY,['TMO'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) which saw its share price drive 175% higher over five years. In the last week the share price is up 1.8%.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Thermo Fisher Scientific managed to grow its earnings per share at 25% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 22% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Thermo Fisher Scientific's TSR for the last 5 years was 178%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Thermo Fisher Scientific shares lost 17% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 21%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 23% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Thermo Fisher Scientific  that you should be aware of.Of course Thermo Fisher Scientific may not be the best stock to buy.

The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,109,194,000Dividend Yield as of November 16: 1.13%The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American multinational financial services company that offers banking and other related services. The company is one of the latest holdings of Fisher Asset Management. The hedge fund opened its position in the company with over 15.4 million shares, worth over $1.1 billion. The company represented 0.83% of billionaire Ken Fisher's portfolio. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is another prominent holding of Ken Fisher in Q3.On October 26, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with its previous dividend. The company raised its dividends twice this year, after ceasing dividend growth during the pandemic. As of November 16, the stock has a dividend yield of 1.13%.In November, Deutsche Bank lifted its price target on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) to $101 with a Buy rating on the shares. The firm presented a positive stance on asset managers and exchanges in the current market.At the end of Q2 2022, 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), compared with 78 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $4.5 billion.LVS Advisory mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We purchased shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) around the same time as Interactive Brokers. The investment thesis is similar. Schwab benefits from higher interest rates as it collects income earned from client cash. While IBKR mostly serves retail investors, Schwab has a greater emphasis on wealth advisors and corporate retirement plans. B2B channels are sticker than retail traders and give Schwab pricing power to collect a greater portion of the interest earned than IBKR. Schwab is a more mature business and has fewer reinvestment opportunities than IBKR (which is why I prefer IBKR on the margin); however, Schwab has authorized a massive $15 billion share buyback program (!) representing over 10% of the company’s market cap at the time of announcement. Given that Schwab trades for a mid-teens price-to-earnings multiple and has a low cost of capital, the share buyback should be highly accretive. The combined tailwind from higher interest rates and the buyback program will lead to attractive earnings per share growth over the coming years.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Shares fell due to the rotation out of life sciences tools stocks, driven by concerns about a possible global recession, foreign currency exposure, COVID-related lockdowns in China, and reduced levels of biotechnology funding. We continue to believe Thermo Fisher has a strong long-term growth outlook given a large and growing addressable market coupled with its industry-leading scale, commercial infrastructure, e-commerce platform, supply-chain capabilities, and R&amp;D investment.”8.

Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”6.

To skip our analysis of the recent market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World.The Fertilizer Industry: An AnalysisThe growing global population, climate change, and water scarcity problems have joined forces to put a strain on the production of agricultural products globally. With a growing demand, the need to generate higher crop yields from the existing arable land is rising. This is where fertilizer companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (NYSE:ADM), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) enter the picture. For healthy growth, plants require three main nutrients: Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK). Farmers use fertilizers to fill the soil deficiencies in these nutrients for healthy growth of their crops.Before we delve into the recent market trends for the fertilizer industry, we need to understand the basics of how fertilizers are made. Basic Nitrogen-based fertilizers, such as urea, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), and ammonium nitrate, require ammonia as a feedstock, produced most commonly from natural gas, and coal, in some cases. On the other hand, Phosphorus and Potassium based fertilizers require mineral deposits of these elements.Fertilizer prices have risen significantly in the recent past and may remain elevated at least in the near-term. Urea prices surpassed their 2008 peaks, while phosphates and potash prices are close to 2008 levels, according to the World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook. The Russia-Ukraine conflict led to sanctions on Russia and Belarus, the two leading producers of fertilizers. The crisis was further exacerbated with the reduction in ammonia production due to higher natural gas prices. In addition, China, the largest producer of Nitrogen and Phosphorus, imposed export restrictions to cater to domestic demand.We have picked the top 15 fertilizer companies based on their market capitalization that are involved in the production and delivery of fertilizers. These companies are some of the largest producers of fertilizers worldwide, with products including nitrogen, potash, and phosphate-based commodity fertilizers, as well as complex and specialty fertilizers.Story continuesApart from the public companies included in this list, there are several privately-owned or state-owned companies that hold a significant market share in the fertilizer industry. Belarus-based Belaruskali OAO is the world’s second largest producer of potash. Prior to the sanctions imposed on the country, the company, through state-owned Belarusian Potash Company, exported more than 10 million tons of its products per annum to 140 countries globally. China, Brazil, and India were its major customers.Moscow-based UralChem is a privately-owned producer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. It is the second largest ammonium nitrate producer in the world with production capabilities of 2.7 million tons of ammonium nitrate, 2.2 million tons of ammonia, 0.8 million tons of MAP and DAP, 0.8 million tons of complex fertilizers and 0.5 million tons of urea.EuroChem is a privately-held vertically integrated fertilizer producer with mining assets in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Brazil, production assets across four continents, and a global sales and distribution network.

19,e74c1919-6800-3069-a1fe-e24ef92325e0,WMT,2022-11-18,Better Buy After Earnings: Target (TGT) Vs. Walmart (WMT) Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-buy-earnings-target-tgt-001612262.html,1668730572,STORY,"['TGT', 'WMT']","[Shares of Target TGT dropped 13% Wednesday after the company was unable to beat expectations like Walmart WMT did the day before. Earnings from the two big retailers showed different pictures of how the challenging economic environment is affecting the two companies. Target’s dismal report highlighted a common narrative on the overall behavior of consumer spending.Target and Walmart’s Q3 reports support the narrative that consumers are cutting back on spending and seeking savings. Target CEO Brian Cornell said that shopping behavior later in the quarter was impacted by inflation, rising interest rates, and economic uncertainty.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 &amp; Consumer Spending Target is widely considered among consumers shopping for mid-level to quality and premium goods across a wide range of consumer products. Target relies more on larger ticket/discretionary spending than Walmart, with TGT's emphasis on higher-end home décor, food, clothing, and electronics. Some of the higher-end products come through Target’s partnerships with Apple AAPL, Disney DIS, Levi’s LEVI, and Ulta Beauty ULTA.  Target stores also cater to their audience with premium amenities, including in-shop Starbucks SBUX at many locations. Common and popular consumer household products, food, and groceries are sold in both retail chains. However, Walmart seeks to provide products that can meet price guarantees, unlike many premium retail items and brands.Walmart’s beat on both its top and bottom line during Q3 is a clear and somewhat expected indication that consumer demand is higher for Walmart’s lower price offerings. WMT beat EPS expectations by 13% at $1.50 and 3% on the top line, with sales at $152.81 billion up 8.7% YoY.Target’s miss on its bottom line points to middle-class and higher-paying customers fading and looking for cheaper savings. TGT missed EPS expectations by 28% at $1.54 per share but revenue slightly topped expectations at 26.51 billion. This is an indication that the operating environment is tougher on Target in addition to not getting a push from its customer base.Story continuesEven though Target’s decisive inventory actions taken earlier in the year have the company more prepared for this holiday season, manament anticipates a single-digit sales decline. Walmart also said it improved on inventory levels during Q3 but is cautious of the holiday season as well.Growth &amp; Outlook For TGT’s current fiscal year, earnings are now forecasted to drop -40% at $8.07 per share, with sales up 3% to $109.77 billion. Earnings are expected to stabilize and climb 49% in FY24 at $12.01 per share. Top line growth is also expected with FY24 sales projected to be up 3% to $113.78 billion.Turning to WMT’s current fiscal year, earnings are projected to decline -7% at $5.99 per share, with sales up 5% to $605.08 billion. FY24 earnings are expected to rise 8% with sales up 3% at $623.83 billion.Over the last five years, TGT has grown at a 23% growth rate. This outpaces WMT’s 8% and the S&amp;P 500’s 13% growth rate.Performance &amp; Valuation Over the last year, Walmart shares have acted somewhat defensive and recouped losses from earlier in the year. After their Q3 reports, WMT is now up +2% YTD to outperform TGT’s -29% and the benchmark. However, over the last decade, TGT’s total return has still beaten WMT.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter the large drop following its Q3 release, TGT trades at a 19.2X forward earnings multiple and further below its decade-high of 26.8X. In comparison, WMT now trades at a 25.4X forward earnings multiple, solidly below its decade-high of 28.1X.From a valuation standpoint, Target continues to look more attractive relative to Walmart and this would be expected after Wednesday’s decline. However, Target’s expected return to growth in its FY24 is even more critical as the company expects sales to be slightly down in Q4.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividends Both stocks have strong dividends, having increased them in each of the last five years. However, the TGT dividend trumps WMT. TGT offers investors a 2.78% annual dividend yield at $4.32 per share, which is considerably higher than WMT’s 1.51% at $2.24 per share.WMT’s annual dividend yield is on par with its Retail Supermarkets Industry average of 1.62% but TGT’s dividend is above its Retail-Discount Stores Industry average of 1.04%.Bottom LineBoth TGT and WMT still land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The two omnichannel retailers have an important significance to American society, making them solid long-term investments despite economic uncertainty. The innovation of both companies still rectifies this with Target’s one-stop in-shop approach and Walmart’s push into healthcare.Considering which stock to add to the portfolio still centers around investors’ risk tolerance and time horizon. Short term, WMT stock may continue to be less volatile than TGT and this has been especially true over the last year. However, TGT’s growth and dividend have trumped WMT and Target remains more attractive from a valuation standpoint. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And the big takeaway so far is that shoppers are adjusting their spending habits. Today's standout is Macy's. Its third quarter was solid, sending shares up the most since May.Among the drivers here, a big beat on earnings and better-than-expected guidance. CEO Jeff Gennette saying in a statement, quote, ""We know the consumer is under increasing pressure and has a choice on where to spend."" Macy's high-end stores Bluemercury and Bloomingdale's outperforming, proving that the luxury consumer remains strong.But that certainly is not the case for middle- and lower-income consumers. Also out today, Kohl's. The department store's third-quarter earnings beat. But it pulled its fourth-quarter outlook amid some of these macroeconomic challenges. CFO Jill Timm saying on the earnings call that the retailer, quote, ""saw our middle-income customers continue to purchase fewer items per chip-- per trip and trade down.""That's similar to what we heard from Walmart earlier this week. CFO John Rainey saying that consumers are more cautious in trading down to cheaper items. A warning spending could slow this quarter, Rainey telling analysts, quote, ""Despite a good start to Q4, our guidance assumes that the consumer could slow spending, given persistent inflationary pressures in food and consumables.""And that holds true for Target as well. CEO Brian Cornell saying, quote, ""Consumers are showing increasing signs of stress and pulling back from discretionary purchases."" Obviously a huge hit here to Target in its most recent quarter, bringing up some concerns about what the holiday quarter is going to look like.And, Rachelle, we've talked about higher rates, inflation being a massive headwind here for consumers. Up until now, the consumer has been willing to stomach those higher prices. But as we continue to hear from some of these larger retailers, it seems like that narrative is starting to change.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: It is. And we're really seeing a bigger focus on what they're spending the money on. They used to, you know, use a bit of that discretionary income. But now we're seeing that they're spending on the essentials.We saw from Walmart it was the groceries that were helping their earnings, as a lot of people were looking for, you know, cheaper alternatives for food, looking for value in the sort of economy. Interesting, though, still seeing a lot of resilience for the luxury shopper. They clearly seem to be better insulated.As we were just talking about with the housing guest, that market, that demographic seems to be fine. But for people who are in the middle or lower income, they're having to make some difficult choices. And we're seeing that reflected in some of these retailers, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. And that is why Walmart has outperformed because some consumers are trading down, more people reallocating how they're spending, spending instead on groceries instead of some of those discretionary items. So we're starting to see this divergence between performance when it comes to Walmart and Target, two companies that you think would be OK in this type of environment. But Walmart clearly the out-performer up until this point.When it comes to Macy's, the jump today, 13%, was a little bit of a surprise to me, just given the slowdown that we could potentially see in this current quarter and looking out into 2023. But management there at least turning the ship a bit. At least that looks like how Wall Street is interpreting these latest results. We'll see, though, how some of these larger retailers that we haven't yet heard from that we'll get results from in the coming days in coming weeks, how they're faring up until this point.]"

JWN is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers on Nov 22, after the closing bell. The fashion specialty retailer is expected to have witnessed revenue and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at 13 cents per share, suggesting a 66.7% decline from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $3.51 billion, indicating a decrease of 3.6% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.We expect the company’s fiscal third-quarter total revenues to decline 3.4% year over year to $3,511.6 million and the bottom line to fall 66.7% to 13 cents per share.In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 1.25%. Also, it delivered an earnings surprise of 3.5%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNordstrom, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNordstrom has been gaining from positive pricing and broad-based growth across core categories and regions. Robust digital growth and compelling merchandise have also been drivers. Core categories, including men's and women's apparel, shoes, and designer, have been performing well. The persistence of these trends is likely to get reflected in the company’s fiscal third-quarter results.The company has been on track to enhance the performance of Nordstrom Rack and improve inventory. It has been progressing well with its More Reasons to Rack campaign, which is likely to have increased brand awareness and boosted traffic in the to-be-reported quarter.Nordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, improving its supply-chain channels, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com into Nordstrom.com should have contributed to the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter.The company's fiscal third-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from its market strategy, which helps engage with customers through better service and greater access to products, irrespective of the shopping mode. As part of the strategy, Nordstrom expanded services, including order pickup and ship-to-store, to all Nordstrom Rack stores.Higher sales and reduced buying and occupancy costs are likely to have boosted margins in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, gross margin improvement and SG&amp;A leverage, stemming from higher sales, are likely to have aided the adjusted EBIT margin.However, Nordstrom has been witnessing sluggish demand due to rising inflation. The company's fiscal third-quarter sales and earnings performances are expected to have been impacted by declining discretionary spending stemming from inflation.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected the competitive promotional environment in retail to continue in the second half of fiscal 2022. As a result, it has been making efforts to clear excess inventory. The move is likely to have hut margins to some extent in the fiscal third quarter.Management anticipated a mid-single-digit decline in revenues for the fiscal third quarter, as evident from the demand deceleration seen in the latter part of the second quarter. Also, the EBIT margin is likely to be down 200 bps year over year. Our model estimates a 200-bps decline in the fiscal third-quarter EBIT margin to 1.5%, in line with the company’s guidance.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Nordstrom this time around.

We have Norwegian Cruise Lines, Target, and Alibaba on deck and, of course, Jared Blikre joining us for this one.Now, my pick is Norwegian Cruise Lines Holdings, ticker NCLH. Now, they're under pressure today, their stock price down, as you can see there, almost 7%. The cruise operator saw some of the S&amp;P 500's biggest losses after a double downgrade from Credit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken to Underperform from Outperform. Also saw a price target cut to $14 from $20.Now, despite calling it a quality company that has outperformed Year To Date, the reason for that bearish turn, the, quote, ""valuation premium versus peers is likely unsustainable."" Now, he sees better value in some of the peers like Royal Caribbean and Carnival. And, of course, the arrival of Norwegian's new Prima Class series cruise ships also being pushed back, delays there from 2024 and 2025, respectively, to 2025 and 2026.And, as we know, cruise stocks have been beaten up this year as demand hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels. They also took on a lot of pandemic-fueled debt. And, of course, inflation, as we've been talking about, really has consumers being more discerning about how they travel, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly a tough setup here for a number of the cruise lines. It's interesting, when it comes to Norwegian, in terms of what the Street is expecting. There's 10 Buys, seven Holds, and only one Sell on the stock. So here we have a double downgrade, a new price target of $14, which is more than $2 lower from where it is trading today, so maybe this stock has further to fall. Like you were saying, it's more so a valuation play. They're saying the valuation premium compared to those peers likely to prove unsustainable. We'll see.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled at $80.08 a barrel, losing $1.56, or 1.9%.Both benchmarks posted weekly losses, with Brent down about 9% and WTI roughly 10%.A stronger U.S. dollar, which makes oil more expensive to non-American buyers, pushed down crude prices.The market structure of both oil benchmarks shifted in ways that reflect dwindling supply concerns.Crude came close to record highs earlier this year as Russia's invasion of Ukraine added to those worries. In addition, the front-month futures contract soared to a gigantic premium over later-dated contracts, a signal that people were worried about the immediate availability of oil and were willing to pay handsomely to secure supply.Those supply concerns are waning. The current WTI contract is now trading at a discount to the second month, a structure known as contango, for the first time since 2021, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.This condition will also benefit those looking to put more oil in inventories for later, especially with stocks still at low levels.""The deeper the contango, the more likely the market will put those barrels in storage,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.Brent was still in the opposite structure, backwardation, though the premium of nearby Brent over barrels loading in six months fell as low as $3 a barrel, the lowest since April.China, which sources say is looking to slow crude imports from some sources, has seen a rise in COVID-19 cases while hopes for less aggressive U.S. rate hikes have been dented by remarks from some Federal Reserve officials.""The situation in China with COVID continues to haunt this market,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. ""So much optimism gets priced in to the market as soon as they try to say that they're going to reopen, but then the reality on the ground is just completely opposite of that hopeful analysis.""Story continuesAs the European Union's ban on Russian crude looms on Dec. 5, the prospect of more barrels from Russia pressuring the spot crude oil market also weighed on futures prices.Recession concerns have dominated this week even with a tightening of supply by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, together known as OPEC+.""On the demand side, there are concerns about an economic slowdown,"" said Avatrade's Naeem Aslam. ""The path of least resistance seems skewed to the downside.""The Fed is expected to raise rates by a smaller 50 basis points (bps) at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting after four consecutive hikes of 75 bps, a Reuters poll showed.OPEC+, which began a new round of supply cuts in November, holds a policy meeting on Dec. 4.(Reporting by Laila Kearney in New YorkAdditional reporting by Alex Lawler in London, Sonali Paul in Melbourne and Muyu Xu in SingaporeEditing by Philippa Fletcher, Matthew Lewis and David Gregorio)]"

This ratcheted up fears that U.S. economic growth will slow dramatically in the coming quarters, amid pressure from high interest rates and stubborn inflation.London-traded Brent oil futures rose 0.7%, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1% by 00:29 ET (05:29 GMT). Both contracts sank 3.1% and 4.1% on Thursday, respectively, and were set to close the week 6% and 7% lower.Oil prices were also dented by news of rising COVID-19 cases in China, which raised the prospect of more disruptive lockdown measures in the country.The world’s largest oil importer is grappling with its worst outbreak in seven months, and is widely expected to clamp down further on economic activity to prevent the spread of infections.Rising cases in China dispelled hopes that the country will scale back its strict zero-COVID policy in the near-term. A series of weak economic readings this week also showed that the world’s second-largest economy is struggling to shore up growth amid a slew of COVID lockdowns.Slowing crude demand in China and rising interest rates were the two biggest weights on crude prices this year, dragging them well below a 14-year high hit in April.These concerns also largely offset signs of tightening crude supply this week. Data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. crude inventories fell by far more than expected in the prior week, despite an over 4 million barrel release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.A previously announced supply cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies was also seen going into effect this week, as several members of the cartel scaled back their oil shipments.Story continuesThe OPEC also forecast weakening crude demand in the near-term, citing a potential recession threat from high inflation and rising interest rates. But the cartel said it stands ready to support crude prices with more supply cuts, if needed.Western bans on Russian oil exports, which are set to kick in later this year, could also support crude markets by further tightening supply.Related ArticlesOil rises after steep declines, but weekly losses still on tapOil rebounds as dollar dips, but demand concerns weighU.S. watchdog seeks cybersecurity strategy for offshore energy infrastructure]"

Shares have added about 22.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Goldman due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Goldman Q3 Earnings Top Estimates, IB Revenues Slump Y/YGoldman’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $8.25 have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.47. However, the bottom line fell 44.7% from the year-earlier quarter.While strength in the FICC and consumer banking businesses acted as a tailwind, the bank’s results were hurt by lower IB revenues.Goldman also introduced a realignment of its businesses to further capitalize on its operating model. It has put its businesses into three operating segments — Asset &amp; Wealth Management, Global Banking &amp; Markets, and Platform Solutions, effective from the start of fourth-quarter 2022.Net earnings of $3.07 billion decreased 43% from the prior-year quarter.Revenues Dip, Expenses RiseNet revenues of $11.98 billion fell 12% from the year-ago quarter. Nonetheless, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.26 billion.Total operating expenses increased 17% year over year to $7.7 billion.Provision for credit losses was $515 million, higher than $175 million in the prior-year quarter.Segmental Performance MixedThe IB division generated revenues of $1.58 billion in the reported quarter, down 57% year over year. Results reflect a significant decline in net revenues in Underwriting, Financial advisory and Corporate lending.The Global Markets division recorded revenues of $6.20 billion, up 11% year over year. The uptick indicated a rise in net revenues in FICC (up 41%), partially offset by lower equities revenues (down 14%).The Consumer and Wealth Management division’s revenues were a record $2.38 billion, 18% higher than the year-ago figure. While net revenues from Wealth management were essentially unchanged from the third quarter of 2021, consumer banking net revenues nearly doubled from the comparable period.The Asset Management division recorded revenues of $1.82 million, indicating a 20% year-over-year decline. The downside resulted from notably lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments, partially offset by an increase in net revenues from Management and other fees.Firmwide assets under supervision were $2.42 trillion, down 2.7% sequentially.Story continuesCapital Position Mixed, Profitability DeclinesAs of Sep 30, 2022, the standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.3%. The figure was up from the prior-year quarter’s 14.1%. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio was 5.6% as of Sep 30, 2022, unchanged from the prior-year quarter.Also, return on average common shareholders’ equity (on an annualized basis) decreased 11.5 basis points year over year to 11% in the reported quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateIn the quarter under review, Goldman returned $1.89 billion of capital to common shareholders. This included $1 billion in share repurchases and common stock dividends of $893 million.Medium-Term and Long-Term Financial TargetsAt a conference held in February 2022, Goldman’s management provided an update on its medium-term (three-year period) and long-term financial targets. Those are as follows:The company increased medium-term firmwide ROE target to 14-16% from the previous 13% and return on tangible common equity to 15-17% from more than 14% stated earlier.Also, the firm’s efficiency ratio target of 60% has been reiterated. The company already realized $1 billion of expense efficiencies from 2019 to 2021 of the target $1.3 billion.In the Asset Management segment, organic traditional long-term net inflows are projected to reach $350 million by 2024, up $100 billion from the previous target. Also, $225 billion worth of gross alternative fundraising is anticipated by 2024 from the prior target of $150 billion.Goldman announced new targets of more than $10 billion in firmwide management and other fees. Of this, more than $2 billion in alternatives management fees are expected for 2024.In the IB segment, management expects transaction banking revenues to reach $750 million, down from the prior mentioned $1 billion. Deposits of more than $100 billion by 2024 are expected.Revenues in the Consumer and Wealth Management segment are projected to reach $4 billion by 2024. This will likely be supported by more than $150 billion in deposits and loans/cards balance exceeding $30 billion by the same year.Goldman aims to reduce its stress capital buffer toward 5% from the current capital requirement of 6.4%. Also, the company noted that the global systematically important banking buffer (G-SIB) surcharge will increase 50 basis points (bps) to 3%, effective 2023, and another 50 bps to 3.5%, effective 2024, from the current G-SIB 2.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -12.6% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Goldman has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Goldman has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerGoldman is part of the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry. Over the past month, Morgan Stanley (MS), a stock from the same industry, has gained 15.7%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Morgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12%.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Salesforce's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Salesforce is:0.9% = US$536m ÷ US$60b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.01 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Salesforce's Earnings Growth And 0.9% ROEAs you can see, Salesforce's ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 13%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. In spite of this, Salesforce was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 29% in the last five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing Salesforce's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 25% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CRM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Salesforce Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Salesforce doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Salesforce has some positive aspects to its business.

So, you don't need to tell her about the particular challenges facing women in the manufacturing industry. She's living it.Sealed Air, Thursday, November 17, 2022, Press release pictureCrisp, who is also a busy mom and active community member, serves as a mentor and advocate to bring more women into the industry. In some ways, she says, it's a simple message.""We have to communicate that manufacturing is not necessarily a dirty job,"" she said, ""and it's not the man's job.""If it were only that easy.Women have long faced barriers to entry in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields. And once in, they are often met with challenges ranging from the glass ceiling to gender norms and unconscious biases.Women account for 47.5% of the U.S. workforce, but hold less than one-third of the jobs in the manufacturing sector, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Worst yet, a 2021 study from Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute found that one in four women were considering leaving the industry, citing low wages, lack of flexible schedule options, and work-life balance as their top three reasons.Gender inequalities were only heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic, as daycare facilities shut down, schools moved online, and there was a growing need to be at home.""The pandemic really highlighted that we need workplace flexibility,"" said AJ Jorgenson, vice president of strategic program engagement at the Manufacturing Institute, the nonprofit workforce development and education partner of the National Association of Manufacturers. Sealed Air is a member of the association and the company's CEO Ted Doheny serves on its board of directors. ""It doesn't mean just remote work... It means when there are doctor appointments, when there's a sick kid... that they're able to support.""She also added that men are starting to ask for work-life balance almost as much as women.Story continuesRepresentation MattersWomen constitute manufacturing's largest pool of untapped talent in the U.S., according to a 2015 study from Deloitte, the Manufacturing Institute, and the APICS Supply Chain Council (now called Association for Supply Chain Management). By closing the gender gap, companies can reduce turnover and increase innovation and engagement.At Sealed Air as of August 2021, 24.7% of the global employee population and 19.8% of the company's U.S. supply chain workforce are women. Earlier this year, the company announced its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Pledge, which outlines Sealed Air's plan to create a more diverse workforce, including increasing gender diversity across employees globally to more than 30% by 2025.The Women in Manufacturing Benchmark Study 2020 from Thomas, an industrial sourcing and marketing company, in collaboration with Women in Manufacturing, a national trade association, found a positive correlation between female leadership and female employee representation. And yet only 27% of women respondents felt strongly regarding career advancement opportunities at their current employers.""The top difference between women and men and what they're looking for is women are looking for role models throughout their career,"" said Jorgenson. ""Men typically look at C-suite leadership, and that's where they want to see role models. Women want to know ‘Who can I be three, five, 10 years out?'""Those different approaches provided the impetus for the Manufacturing Institute's STEP Ahead Awards, which recognize women in the manufacturing industry for their leadership in science, technology, engineering, and production (STEP) careers, with the hope of inspiring the next generation through mentorship programs.In the nine years since the Manufacturing Institute established the award, six women from Sealed Air have been honored. Sealed Air's 2021 honoree, Susanne Troutt, is the films planning director for the company's global food and shrink packaging business and was formerly the materials manager for its manufacturing plant in Simpsonville, South Carolina, one of the world's largest facilities of its kind. Troutt attended the awards ceremony last year in Washington, D.C., where the Manufacturing Institute is based.""The nomination made me realize that I was an important part of the team and that I had made some significant contributions,"" Troutt said.Changing the ConversationWhile increasing flexibility, representation, and recognition, perceptions of the industry also need to be addressed for younger generations of workers, including women. That's where plant manager Crisp comes in, and she's determined to make an impact.As one of only four female plant managers at Sealed Air, which operates 106 manufacturing facilities worldwide, Crisp has worked for the company her entire career. Starting as an intern, Crisp soon earned a full-time position and then held various jobs throughout the company's supply chain organization before becoming the manager for Sealed Air's two manufacturing plants in North Carolina. The two facilities make protective packaging materials such as BUBBLE WRAP® brand bubble cushioning, SEALED AIR® brand Korrvu®retention and suspension packaging, and BUBBLE WRAP® brand cushioned paper mailers.While she maintains there are no typical days in her role as plant manager, Crisp spends much of her time analyzing the performance of operations, understanding obstacles facing her teams, and identifying resources and solutions to solve those problems.When she first transitioned into a management role, Crisp struggled with accepting that she could only accomplish so much each day. ""If I promised I was going to do something, I wanted to deliver,"" she said. ""However, as responsibilities are added, time management is key, but so is making time for oneself.""Crisp makes sure to share this this view with others. She said she often sees her managers and operators struggling with the same issue and wants them to celebrate their small wins, while doing everything within their control to plan and communicate. ""That's how we achieve success as an organization and as a team,"" she said.While it's a balancing act taking care of two kids, maintaining a home, and running two manufacturing plants that operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Crisp has learned to schedule time for ""making the transition from manager to mom,"" she said.In 2018, Crisp was honored with a STEP Ahead Award, which allowed her to expand her reach by connecting with other women in the industry and hearing their challenges and learning from their experiences. Since then, Crisp has used those connections and her passion for her community to impact the next generation.""Pre-COVID, we would do tours of the facilities and expose local middle school, high school, and community college students to the protective packaging business and the kinds of job opportunities Sealed Air offers here,"" Crisp said.Similarly, Troutt is sharing her knowledge with women at Sealed Air about different career paths in manufacturing. After transitioning into her current role, Troutt recommended as her replacement a woman she had mentored for 10 years who began her career in the customer service department.""It just takes the right people educating others about all the opportunities within manufacturing and serving as a mentor when needed,"" Troutt said.Moving ForwardFrom creating diversity programs and offering flexible work options, to mentoring and recognizing women, there are myriad ways the manufacturing industry can address the challenges facing women today and tap into its largest talent pool.Society is becoming more gender inclusive, but ""we have a long way to go"" in the manufacturing industry Jorgenson said. Manufacturers need to consider what they are doing actively and continuously to engage women, she suggested. ""I think time will tell. I'm very hopeful.""View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Sealed Air on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Sealed AirWebsite: http://www.sealedair.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Sealed AirView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/726662/From-Managers-to-Moms-Women-Are-Manufacturings-Largest-Untapped-Talent-Pool]"

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $85.59 a barrel yesterday — the lowest since Oct 25.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Nov 11.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.4 million barrels compared to expectations of a 400,000-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and higher refinery demand accounted for the big stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer.Total domestic stocks now stand at 435.4 million barrels — 0.6% more than the year-ago figure but 4% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 1.6 million barrels to 25.6 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 28 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.5 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the first time in five weeks. The 2.2 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to a pullback in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would fall 800,000 barrels. At 207.9 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 1.9% less than the year-earlier level and 5% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) increased after dropping last week. The 1.1 million-barrel gain reflected a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 500,000 barrels. Despite last week’s build, current inventories — at 107.4 million barrels — are 13.2% below the year-ago level and 15% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 92.9%, rose 0.8% from the prior week.Story continuesFinal WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 66% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 17%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Marathon Oil MRO.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 148%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 289.4% for this year.

If you want to read about some more shorted stocks, go directly to 5 Most Shorted Stocks Right Now.The stock market has been volatile in the past few months as soaring inflation and rising rates combine to create an uncertain business environment in which growth stocks have taken a beating. Many elite investors who were bullish on growth firms at the beginning of this year have instead started shorting these growth stocks as recession fears rise. Even top firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) have underperformed under these pressures. However, recent data by the US government suggests that inflation may be peaking and it might be the right time to buy the dip on some of these growth firms or to initiate a short squeeze on the shorted stocks. Per latest figures, the consumer price index rose just 0.4% for the month in October, representing an increase of 7.7% from a year ago, the lowest annual increase since January and a slowdown from the 8.2% annual pace in the prior month. Top economists had been expecting increases of 0.6% and 7.9%. Our MethodologyThe companies that have a short interest of more than 20% were selected for the list.

The market’s rapid shift toward favouring profitable companies posed challenges for the company in the quarter as did weaker results which were pandemic-related.Warby Parker is less profitable at this stage of its lifecycle as it invests in building out its retail footprint. We expect the company to be cash-flow positive within a year as it continues to benefit from scale and as retail foot traffic and productivity of the company’s retail stores return to normal as pandemic conditions ease. We may have had the opportunity to add this holding at a more ideal price. However, we remain excited about the long-term growth potential of the business, and the expected IRR.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Shorted Stocks Right Now. Suggested Articles:10 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back12 Best Reddit Stocks To Invest In12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks to Invest InDisclosure.

That title coming on the heels of the very successful release of ""Modern Warfare 2,"" the newest game in the franchise.Well, joining us now to discuss this is ""Call of Duty"" senior vice president and general manager, Johanna Faries, and Yahoo Finance's own Allie Garfinkle. Welcome to the show, Johanna. So, obviously, this came with a lot of fanfare. Talk about some of the new features that come with ""Warzone."" I know the proximity chat has been causing a lot of buzz.JOHANNA FARIES: It's great that you know that already. Yes, we are on the precipice of awesome new release and new player engagement with ""Warzone 2.0."" We just launched that yesterday. So even more players are pouring into ""Call of Duty"" since we launched ""Modern Warfare 2"" just a few weeks ago. To your point on features proximity chat is a way where you can overhear some of the other players that might be nearby while you're playing your experience on this big map of ours that we've released.And we're already seeing some incredible instances and interactions between players through that type of a feature. I think it reflects as well just more of the social connection points that gaming affords our community. And we often say ""Call of Duty"" is one of the best ways to make friends, meet new friends, and create long lasting connections. And so we love these types of features because this is a new way to not only play with the people you know, but maybe find new interactions and new friends along the way.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Johanna, we've been talking about slowing consumer spending on this show a lot. But that's not showing up here in these numbers that we're seeing from ""Modern Warfare"" at all. So can you talk to me a little bit about why you think you've successfully bucked that trend and what these numbers say about the pull of ""Call of Duty"" in popular culture?Story continuesJOHANNA FARIES: It's been tremendous. We've been looking at these numbers for several weeks, as I mentioned. And to blow past some of the biggest entertainment launches in the entire industry with the launch of ""Modern Warfare 2"" and now with ""Warzone 2.0"" yesterday has been a hallmark and watershed moment for us. We're very proud of it. We're very excited.More so than ever before, I think one of the reasons we're seeing success is we've kept so close to our community of influencers, our streamers, really thinking about what our players are looking for, and how do we deliver the best possible gameplay experience for them. And that's been in the works for years. We've been looking at this from every angle about how do we make sure this new era for the franchise is built from a player first lens.To see it pay off now to the tune of the numbers that we've been reporting in just the last several days reflects a lot of that work. And we're going to continue to think player first in everything we do. So more to come. We often say that. This is just the beginning of the new bold era for ""Call of Duty,"" but it is a testament to a lot of the work we've been laying and forging for ourselves and for our community for many months, if not years, now.ALLIE GARFINKLE: And I know you're on the heels of this pandemic explosion, but I know you've also been watching those players and getting a lot of player feedback. So I'd love to hear a little bit about your sense of how the pandemic has affected player behavior.JOHANNA FARIES: It was interesting. When we first launched, for example, our first ""Warzone"" experience back in 2020, it occurred in the same month as the pandemic started to really take shape across the world. We learned a ton about how gaming could provide connection and interaction and gathering spaces virtually when so much of the world was shut down.Again, I think we were well positioned, given the platform that we had, and we had great gameplay. It always starts with great experiences, and the product was ready for an exciting launch, regardless of what had happened on the pandemic side. I think it also is a reflection of some of the investments we had been making to expand the bold opportunity we knew we had for ""Call of Duty.""We saw that on the esports side where a lot of traditional sports leagues had to shut down and regroup in terms of operating. Our esports leagues like Call of Duty League, Overwatch League, and others, were able to still broadcast and host a live competition remotely. Again, it just speaks to, I think, the tech first, digitally native infrastructure that we've built. And we were able to expand the conversation around how potent an entertainment medium and a consumer engagement experience gaming is at that time. I think it validated a lot of the growth that we're experiencing now.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Johanna, against the backdrop of that, we also have the Microsoft acquisition still on the table. Should that go through, how would things change for ""Call of Duty"" in terms of sales and also where people can access it?JOHANNA FARIES: As you can imagine, I can't really opine. The statements are out there. Microsoft has made their comments as well regarding that. We understand that that has interesting possibilities for sure. But right now, our eyes are completely focused on this moment for ""Call of Duty."" Day in and day out, we're looking at how do we continue to make this launch as special as possible.How do we continue to appeal to our existing player base, but also create new gameplay experiences and put out new features, as you had mentioned, for new players to come into the community. So we're totally focused there. And we know that if our players are having a great time, we're well positioned for the future. And we think it's very bright.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And I do want to ask you about Blizzard ending its partnership with NetEase in China-- and ""Call of Duty"" ending online operations in China. So what does the future of ""Call of Duty"" look like in that region for China and Asia?JOHANNA FARIES: So that announcement has no impact on ""Call of Duty."" So, again, we are sort of all systems go, focused on the launches we have and more to come in the weeks and the months to follow. I would defer to our friends at Blizzard, who are more directly impacted by that news. So, again, we're focused on ""Modern Warfare 2,"" and lots to get done there.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right. Thank you so much, Johanna Faries, for joining us, and Allie Garfinkle as well.JOHANNA FARIES: Thank you.]"

You can skip our detailed discussion on Fisher's investment strategy and his hedge fund's performance, and go directly to read Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks. Ken Fisher founded Fisher Investments in 1979 and is currently serving as the chairman and co-chief investment officer of the firm. As of November, the billionaire has a real-time net worth of $6.9 billion. His decades-long experience in the investment field has inspired other investors to follow his investment strategies. Fisher Asset Management follows a personalized approach, providing tailored portfolios to clients according to their needs. In addition to this, the firm also meticulously analyzes global investment opportunities to interpret information from different markets around the world. The fund currently manages over $197 billion for investors globally.As fears of inflation continue to rise this year, Fisher presented an encouraging picture of the stock market for the coming months. In one of his recent interviews with Fox Business, he asserted that loan growth in the US is robust this year despite inflation. He further mentioned that year-over-year loan growth has reached 11.5%, which indicates that the US economy is unlikely to fall into recession as of now. In another column he wrote for Reuters, Fisher highlighted the importance of compound growth of stocks in the bear markets. He also mentioned that long-term holdings in investors’ portfolios can help generate strong returns during the economic downturn.As of the close of Q3 2022, Fisher Asset Management’s 13F portfolio was valued at over $133.4 billion, compared with $144.3 billion in the previous quarter. Healthcare and tech sectors dominated the firm’s portfolio during the quarter. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) were the fund’s top three holdings. Moreover, the firm also had significant investments in dividend stocks. In this article, we will analyze the top dividend stocks in billionaire Ken Fisher’s portfolio.Story continues Our Methodology:For this list, we shortlisted dividend stocks from Fisher Asset Management's 13F portfolio, as of the third quarter of 2022. We analyze these stocks through their balance sheets, analysts' ratings, and dividend policies. The stocks are ranked according to their stake value in the firm's portfolio.Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 10 Dividend Stock Picks10. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,109,194,000Dividend Yield as of November 16: 1.13%The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American multinational financial services company that offers banking and other related services. The company is one of the latest holdings of Fisher Asset Management. The hedge fund opened its position in the company with over 15.4 million shares, worth over $1.1 billion. The company represented 0.83% of billionaire Ken Fisher's portfolio. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is another prominent holding of Ken Fisher in Q3.On October 26, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with its previous dividend. The company raised its dividends twice this year, after ceasing dividend growth during the pandemic. As of November 16, the stock has a dividend yield of 1.13%.In November, Deutsche Bank lifted its price target on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) to $101 with a Buy rating on the shares. The firm presented a positive stance on asset managers and exchanges in the current market.At the end of Q2 2022, 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), compared with 78 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $4.5 billion.LVS Advisory mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We purchased shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) around the same time as Interactive Brokers. The investment thesis is similar. Schwab benefits from higher interest rates as it collects income earned from client cash. While IBKR mostly serves retail investors, Schwab has a greater emphasis on wealth advisors and corporate retirement plans. B2B channels are sticker than retail traders and give Schwab pricing power to collect a greater portion of the interest earned than IBKR. Schwab is a more mature business and has fewer reinvestment opportunities than IBKR (which is why I prefer IBKR on the margin); however, Schwab has authorized a massive $15 billion share buyback program (!) representing over 10% of the company’s market cap at the time of announcement. Given that Schwab trades for a mid-teens price-to-earnings multiple and has a low cost of capital, the share buyback should be highly accretive. The combined tailwind from higher interest rates and the buyback program will lead to attractive earnings per share growth over the coming years.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

We continue to believe Thermo Fisher has a strong long-term growth outlook given a large and growing addressable market coupled with its industry-leading scale, commercial infrastructure, e-commerce platform, supply-chain capabilities, and R&amp;D investment.”8.

Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”6.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Paychex with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Paychex How Quickly Is Paychex Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Paychex grew its EPS by 11% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Paychex shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 38% to 40%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Paychex's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Paychex Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Paychex has a market capitalisation of US$43b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$4.6b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Paychex, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.Paychex's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$3.6m in the year prior to May 2022. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Should You Add Paychex To Your Watchlist?One positive for Paychex is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Paychex, but the fun does not stop there. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. Don't forget that there may still be risks.

Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$96.97. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$21m for 274.75k shares. But they sold 26.96k shares for US$3.0m. In total, Starbucks insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Starbucks Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Starbucks. In total, insiders bought US$6.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Starbucks insiders own about US$2.3b worth of shares (which is 2.0% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Starbucks Insiders?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Starbucks. Looks promising! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Starbucks. Be aware that Starbucks is showing 4 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those are a bit concerning...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ:XEL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 80% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$1.5b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 8.1% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Xcel Energy. Check out our latest analysis for Xcel Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Xcel Energy?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Xcel Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Xcel Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Xcel Energy is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.9% of common stock, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc. holds about 5.8% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Xcel EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Xcel Energy Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$42m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Xcel Energy   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

79,bc76438e-7e44-3e63-bb7a-9425695ce218,ADM,2022-11-18,15 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-fertilizer-companies-world-123548121.html,1668774948,STORY,['ADM'],"[In this article we will take a look at the 15 largest fertilizer companies in the world. To skip our analysis of the recent market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World.The Fertilizer Industry: An AnalysisThe growing global population, climate change, and water scarcity problems have joined forces to put a strain on the production of agricultural products globally. With a growing demand, the need to generate higher crop yields from the existing arable land is rising. This is where fertilizer companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (NYSE:ADM), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) enter the picture. For healthy growth, plants require three main nutrients: Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK). Farmers use fertilizers to fill the soil deficiencies in these nutrients for healthy growth of their crops.Before we delve into the recent market trends for the fertilizer industry, we need to understand the basics of how fertilizers are made. Basic Nitrogen-based fertilizers, such as urea, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), and ammonium nitrate, require ammonia as a feedstock, produced most commonly from natural gas, and coal, in some cases. On the other hand, Phosphorus and Potassium based fertilizers require mineral deposits of these elements.Fertilizer prices have risen significantly in the recent past and may remain elevated at least in the near-term. Urea prices surpassed their 2008 peaks, while phosphates and potash prices are close to 2008 levels, according to the World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook. The Russia-Ukraine conflict led to sanctions on Russia and Belarus, the two leading producers of fertilizers. The crisis was further exacerbated with the reduction in ammonia production due to higher natural gas prices. In addition, China, the largest producer of Nitrogen and Phosphorus, imposed export restrictions to cater to domestic demand.We have picked the top 15 fertilizer companies based on their market capitalization that are involved in the production and delivery of fertilizers. These companies are some of the largest producers of fertilizers worldwide, with products including nitrogen, potash, and phosphate-based commodity fertilizers, as well as complex and specialty fertilizers.Story continuesApart from the public companies included in this list, there are several privately-owned or state-owned companies that hold a significant market share in the fertilizer industry. Belarus-based Belaruskali OAO is the world’s second largest producer of potash. Prior to the sanctions imposed on the country, the company, through state-owned Belarusian Potash Company, exported more than 10 million tons of its products per annum to 140 countries globally. China, Brazil, and India were its major customers.Moscow-based UralChem is a privately-owned producer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. It is the second largest ammonium nitrate producer in the world with production capabilities of 2.7 million tons of ammonium nitrate, 2.2 million tons of ammonia, 0.8 million tons of MAP and DAP, 0.8 million tons of complex fertilizers and 0.5 million tons of urea.EuroChem is a privately-held vertically integrated fertilizer producer with mining assets in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Brazil, production assets across four continents, and a global sales and distribution network. The company ranks among the top five mineral fertilizers producers globally, with 27 million tons of fertilizer produced in 2021.Photo by Sebastian Gómez on UnsplashLargest Fertilizer Companies in the World15.

The move will help many digitally native brands to strategically expand as omni-channel retailers.In recent years, omni-channel retailing has gained momentum and has become the focal point for many retailers. Although online shopping is convenient, physical stores will remain a vital sales channel over the long run as the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store cannot be replaced with e-commerce.In this context, Simon Property’s adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well. Moreover, its online retail platform, coupled with an omni-channel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. Hence, its recent move is a strategic fit.To begin with, Simon Property and Leap intend to open four stores between California and Florida. These are True Classic Tees in Los Angeles' Del Amo Fashion Center® and ThirdLove, Sugarfina and Goodlife in Florida's Town Center at Boca Raton®.Per Zachary Beloff, vice president of leasing at Simon Property, “We are excited to work with Leap to help introduce growing brands to the value of brick-and-mortar retail. This is a pivotal time where stores are top of mind with nearly every brand growing in the U.S., and with the speed and nimbleness of the LEAP model, the expansion process has been streamlined immensely.”As retailers realize the importance of omni-channel retailing and seek to open brick-and-mortar locations across the United States, they are likely to capitalize on the years of experience and expertise that Simon Property and Leap have to offer. The association between these two entities will help brands select top, data-driven locations for their business.In addition, Simon Property has been exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years as it helps capture the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.It even capitalized on purchasing recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. Investments in them seem strategic for Simon Property as the brands have been generating a decent amount from digital sales.With a solid balance-sheet position and ample financial flexibility, SPG remains well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share has been revised marginally upward over the past week to $11.68.Shares of SPG have gained 28.8% compared with the industry’s growth of 16% in the quarter-to-date period.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT and American Assets Trust AAT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

(NYSE:HCA) led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on HCA Healthcare’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare Is HCA Healthcare Still Cheap?Great news for investors – HCA Healthcare is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that HCA Healthcare’s ratio of 11.95x is below its peer average of 20.69x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Healthcare industry. What’s more interesting is that, HCA Healthcare’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from HCA Healthcare?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. HCA Healthcare's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since HCA is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on HCA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy HCA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for HCA Healthcare (1 shouldn't be ignored!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.If you are no longer interested in HCA Healthcare, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

87,b881bfba-af2b-3af0-85b0-77ad6581fb0f,GS,2022-11-18,Goldman (GS) Up 22.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-gs-22-6-since-163004013.html,1668702604,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD', 'MS']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Goldman Sachs (GS). Shares have added about 22.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Goldman due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Goldman Q3 Earnings Top Estimates, IB Revenues Slump Y/YGoldman’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $8.25 have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.47. However, the bottom line fell 44.7% from the year-earlier quarter.While strength in the FICC and consumer banking businesses acted as a tailwind, the bank’s results were hurt by lower IB revenues.Goldman also introduced a realignment of its businesses to further capitalize on its operating model. It has put its businesses into three operating segments — Asset &amp; Wealth Management, Global Banking &amp; Markets, and Platform Solutions, effective from the start of fourth-quarter 2022.Net earnings of $3.07 billion decreased 43% from the prior-year quarter.Revenues Dip, Expenses RiseNet revenues of $11.98 billion fell 12% from the year-ago quarter. Nonetheless, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.26 billion.Total operating expenses increased 17% year over year to $7.7 billion.Provision for credit losses was $515 million, higher than $175 million in the prior-year quarter.Segmental Performance MixedThe IB division generated revenues of $1.58 billion in the reported quarter, down 57% year over year. Results reflect a significant decline in net revenues in Underwriting, Financial advisory and Corporate lending.The Global Markets division recorded revenues of $6.20 billion, up 11% year over year. The uptick indicated a rise in net revenues in FICC (up 41%), partially offset by lower equities revenues (down 14%).The Consumer and Wealth Management division’s revenues were a record $2.38 billion, 18% higher than the year-ago figure. While net revenues from Wealth management were essentially unchanged from the third quarter of 2021, consumer banking net revenues nearly doubled from the comparable period.The Asset Management division recorded revenues of $1.82 million, indicating a 20% year-over-year decline. The downside resulted from notably lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments, partially offset by an increase in net revenues from Management and other fees.Firmwide assets under supervision were $2.42 trillion, down 2.7% sequentially.Story continuesCapital Position Mixed, Profitability DeclinesAs of Sep 30, 2022, the standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.3%. The figure was up from the prior-year quarter’s 14.1%. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio was 5.6% as of Sep 30, 2022, unchanged from the prior-year quarter.Also, return on average common shareholders’ equity (on an annualized basis) decreased 11.5 basis points year over year to 11% in the reported quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateIn the quarter under review, Goldman returned $1.89 billion of capital to common shareholders. This included $1 billion in share repurchases and common stock dividends of $893 million.Medium-Term and Long-Term Financial TargetsAt a conference held in February 2022, Goldman’s management provided an update on its medium-term (three-year period) and long-term financial targets. Those are as follows:The company increased medium-term firmwide ROE target to 14-16% from the previous 13% and return on tangible common equity to 15-17% from more than 14% stated earlier.Also, the firm’s efficiency ratio target of 60% has been reiterated. The company already realized $1 billion of expense efficiencies from 2019 to 2021 of the target $1.3 billion.In the Asset Management segment, organic traditional long-term net inflows are projected to reach $350 million by 2024, up $100 billion from the previous target. Also, $225 billion worth of gross alternative fundraising is anticipated by 2024 from the prior target of $150 billion.Goldman announced new targets of more than $10 billion in firmwide management and other fees. Of this, more than $2 billion in alternatives management fees are expected for 2024.In the IB segment, management expects transaction banking revenues to reach $750 million, down from the prior mentioned $1 billion. Deposits of more than $100 billion by 2024 are expected.Revenues in the Consumer and Wealth Management segment are projected to reach $4 billion by 2024. This will likely be supported by more than $150 billion in deposits and loans/cards balance exceeding $30 billion by the same year.Goldman aims to reduce its stress capital buffer toward 5% from the current capital requirement of 6.4%. Also, the company noted that the global systematically important banking buffer (G-SIB) surcharge will increase 50 basis points (bps) to 3%, effective 2023, and another 50 bps to 3.5%, effective 2024, from the current G-SIB 2.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -12.6% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Goldman has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Goldman has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerGoldman is part of the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry. Over the past month, Morgan Stanley (MS), a stock from the same industry, has gained 15.7%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Morgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $2.04 a year ago.Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.44 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -30.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.7%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)Story continuesThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

""Even for a few purchases I’ve been planning to make for myself for a few months now, I’m waiting to see if I’ll get a better deal around Black Friday or Cyber Monday,"" she said.""I prefer to try clothes on rather than order online. I typically don’t buy clothes as holiday gifts for others unless I know their size and style in a particular store.""Deeper discounts may be yet to come as sales at Target and Macy's Inc, major holiday shopping destinations, fell unexpectedly in October and November, executives said on conference calls this week.Many shoppers are waiting until Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, and Cyber Monday, November 28, to pounce on potentially better deals as they pinch pennies, retail executives said on conference calls this week. A Saturday shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year gives shoppers extra time to hold out for better bargains.Holiday shopping is expected to slow broadly. “Customers at the lower tier ... they are purposefully shopping,” said Jessica Ramirez, a research analyst at advisory firm Jane Hali &amp; Associates LLC. “They buy when they’re ready and when it’s needed. We do expect to see more frequent store visits but smaller baskets.”Story continuesRetailers including Kohl's and Foot Locker Inc have offered more generous deals compared to last year, according to a research note from Jane Hali.Clothing is the only category this year that is cheaper than last when accounting for both discounts and changes in manufacturer's suggested price, according to DataWeave.DataWeave found that sweatpants and Land's End joggers at Kohls, and jeans from outdoorsy chain Cabela's Inc, are as much as 30% cheaper than last year.Ramirez added that shoppers may also opt for cosmetics and beauty purchases this year over pricier shoes. “It’s an easier buy at a different price point,” Ramirez said. “Make-up is another way to dress up without having to splurge.”A warning from Target that toy sales slowed down was ""a little scary,"" said Joe Feldman, senior managing director at consumer-focused research firm Telsey Advisory Group. Discounts on toys and electronics were bigger globally every month so far this year except for January and February, according to separate data from Salesforce.com.But toy prices, even with discounts, are up about 2.4%, DataWeave found.The suggested price for a PJ Masks Glow &amp; Go Gekko mobile car toy by Hasbro is $22.99, up nearly 10% from last year. Shoppers are paying $16.99 for the toy this year at Kohl's, after discounts, compared to $11.54 last year, according to DataWeave.Retailers that hold off on competitive deals risk getting stuck with costly inventory - a dynamic that will likely lead to further discounts later this month and early next.Early holiday deals have not been big enough yet for shoppers to ""bite"" and consumers are waiting to see the biggest discounts during Cyber Week, said Rob Garf, vice president of retail at Salesforce.Hasbro's Nerf Gelfire, a toy gun that shoots gel beads, was on sale on Monday for $20 off the list price of $79.99 on Target.com. Action figures from Black Panther Wakanda Forever, also made by Hasbro, were also 30% off at Target.Hasbro earmarks 70% of its advertising budget for October, November and December, said CEO Chris Cocks in an interview with Reuters this month.“It's really heavily weighted in November, December,"" he said. ""If you just think about the number of promotions we're going to have, the number of Black Friday deals, and advertising we're going to have, (it's going) to be significantly bigger this year (than) it's been in the last two years.""Mattel Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the toymaker expects increased discounts and promotions that will squeeze its margins in the fourth quarter.Mattel’s 5-Barbie playset on Tuesday was discounted to $49.00 from $119.88 for Walmart.com shoppers, while its 18-piece fashion doll set was on clearance at buybuyBaby.com.But broadly, prices on merchandise across many categories rose 14% in the United States and 8% globally compared to 2020, according to Salesforce.Dwight Hill, vice president of retail North America at digital consultancy Publicis Sapient, said that consumers have long been trained to wait for the best deals and watch retailers ""race to the bottom.""(Reporting by Arriana McLymore, Siddharth Cavale and Jessica DiNapoli Editing by Nick Zieminski)]"

96,85e958db-2ae0-387e-8fb2-32f0349296ff,NFLX,2022-11-18,Weekly comic: Big Tech's day of reckoning,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weekly-comic-big-techs-day-022222952.html,1668738142,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'NFLX']","[By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Tech’s day of reckoning has arrived.The sector has ridden a 12-year wave of easy money to sell dreams of unimaginable wealth on narratives that have depended less and less on substance, and more and more on buzzwords. At a time when capital can earn 4% today for no risk at all, those peddling fortunes built on cash flows in five years’ time are increasingly struggling.And that's no bad thing.Weaker parts of the tech sector have been slimming down for a year or more already. The significance of recent layoffs is in the fact that they have been at companies that until quite recently were widely considered to be invulnerable, due to their commanding position in the new megatrends of the age, be it streaming, social media, e-commerce, or self-driving cars.Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is cutting 11,000, or one in seven of its staff worldwide. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is reportedly looking to cut 10,000, admittedly a much smaller share of its 1.5 million-strong workforce. Twitter, under the uniquely aggressive culling of its new owner Elon Musk, is cutting numbers by half.Stripe, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), along with Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) have all trodden the same path this year. Every day, the list lengthens: this week alone, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has announced it will cut 4,100 jobs, while streaming device maker Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) said on Thursday it will cut 200. In both cases, that’s around 5% of the total.One common theme running through the narrative is the weakness of the advertising sector, which has both cyclical and structural elements.The structural element is that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounts for over a quarter of the world’s mobile devices and a larger share among richer consumers, has made it all but impossible to sell more highly-priced targeted ads by tightening its privacy policy. Apple users appear to like this feature, so there is little chance of it being reversed.Story continuesThe cyclical element is essentially a reversion to the mean: ad spending, which is never more than a derivative of consumer incomes, boomed during the pandemic when manufacturers had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bombard the bored and homebound with ideas on how to spend their stimulus checks. It started shrinking when inflation started eating into disposable incomes and that process accelerated as fears of job insecurity spread around the world.Consumer confidence is now at an all-time low in countries like the U.K. and Germany.Another common thread is the over-confidence bred by the extraordinary and patently unsustainable policy settings of the pandemic years. Too many people believed either that the good times would last forever, or that, more charitably, the pandemic would accelerate irreversible long-term trends to digitization and automation. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and, on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy both admitted to having over-hired.A third thread is that too many of the sector’s long shots have turned out to be simply too long. While the core businesses of companies like Meta and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) make good money, the pet projects they are supporting on the company balance sheet are losing money hand over fist.Altimeter Capital’s Mark Gerstner begged Zuckerberg last month to halve spending on his Metaverse projects to a maximum of $5 billion a year. Chris Hohn, head of London-based hedge fund TCI, directed the same criticism at Google owner Alphabet this week, calling out CEO Sundar Pichai for blowing $20 billion over the last five years on its “Other Bets” division, whose largest element is the Waymo self-driving venture.The over-expansion at Big Tech has been bad not just for the companies’ shareholders (Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are down by 43%, 67%, and 32%, respectively, this year), but for the U.S. economy in general, sucking up talent that could have been deployed more productively.“We have a shortage of talent in Silicon Valley,"" Altimeter's Gerstner said. ""Meta and other large companies have made it very difficult for start-ups to hire.” Gerstner said he’s “confident that these employees will find replacement jobs and quickly be back to work on important inventions that will move us all forward.”The economic data, so far, appear to be proving him right. While the number of layoffs is clearly increasing, the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits has not risen markedly from a 60-year low. Clearly, those being laid off have plenty of opportunities elsewhere. Enough soft landings at the personal level give the economy a good chance of achieving one at the macro level.That reality may go some way to explaining the resilience of U.S. consumption in recent weeks and months, even though the outlook has clearly darkened. More consumers may be losing their jobs, but if they are confident enough of finding a new one quickly, they will be less afraid of dipping into savings to keep up their consumption levels.Against such a backdrop, despite the obvious human distress, there are good reasons not to be too downhearted at Big Tech’s downsizing. What has been seen so far is more an exercise in capital discipline and the unwinding of excess, not a sign of a vicious downward spiral. As days of reckoning go, the market has seen much worse.Related ArticlesWeekly comic: Big Tech's day of reckoningTake Five: Black Friday testLagarde: Rate hike path dependent on inflation outlook]"
97,6003b246-9f65-3869-ba13-16dbf37fb148,NFLX,2022-11-18,10 Biggest Film Production Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-biggest-film-production-companies-193324060.html,1668713604,STORY,"['DIS', 'NFLX']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten biggest film production companies in the world. For more companies, take a look at the 5 Biggest Film Production Companies in the World. The film production industry is one of the most lucrative industries in the world, and one that has evolved with time as well. Since the days of theatrical performances to the original box offices in New York City and now to the era of professional visualizations, global productions, and billion dollar franchises, the industry has seen it all.The global movies and entertainment market was valued at $90 billion last year according to the research firm Grand View Research and is estimated to sit at $95 billion by the end of this year. From then until 2030, the segment will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2% and be worth a whopping $170 billion by the end of the forecast period. In this multi billion dollar pie, North America was the dominating player, and according to the research firm, the region accounted for 34.5% of the overall market last year. However, particularly due to its size, the North American film market will not grow as fast as the fastest growing region which is Asia Pacific. The region will outpace the broader industry when it comes to growth, through a CAGR of 8.2%.Another report, this time from Market Data Research, focuses its attention on the motion picture industry. It estimates that this particular sector was worth $42 billion in 2019 and will grow at an 8.3% CAGR to sit at an estimated $44 billion by the end of 2027. It agrees with Grand View Research on Asia Pacific being the region with the highest growth, and highlights that the region's younger population of individuals aged under 25 years will drive move viewership. Segregating motion pictures by genre, Market Data Research reveals that Fantasy was the largest segment in 2019 and it will continue to lead in 2027 as well. In the second place, to no one's surprise, are Action movies. Additionally, the research firm outlines that Asia Pacific will have a strong growth rate of 9.5%.Story continuesDelving a bit deeper into film production, especially since newer technologies such as 3D animations and movies are disruptive, is merited as well. Fortunately for us, IndustryARC has a report that analyzed the 3D movie theater market. This market will have the strongest growth rate in our research today, with the research firm stating that it will grow at a whopping 20.1% CAGR between 2021 and 2026 to sit at an estimated $10 billion by the end of the forecast period. Coupling this with Market Data Research's value of $44 billion for motion pictures in 2027, it is safe to conclude that 3D movie theaters will account for more than a quarter of the total pie. The research firm also reports that in 2020, multiplexes held the highest market share, since they have multiple screens which allow the cinema to host a maximum number of viewers. In 2020, Asia held the largest share as it contributed 35% to the overall market, Europe controlled 23% of the market, and North America came in second place after accounting for 20% of the overall revenue pie.Today's piece will focus on the largest film production companies in the world, and the top players are The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Netflix, Inc.

100,5fbbc197-445a-31ba-a0a9-b836c87a48cb,PSX,2022-11-18,Bull of the Day: Phillips 66 (PSX),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-phillips-66-psx-090009024.html,1668762009,STORY,['PSX'],"[Phillips 66 PSX is an oil and gas firm that topped our quarterly estimates in early November and boosted its guidance once again for 2022, and more importantly, for fiscal 2023.Phillips 66 shares have soared in 2022, yet its improved earnings outlook has kept its valuation levels very appealing. Plus, its strong dividend yield is much-needed as investors attempt to find ways to keep pace with inflation. And it said earlier this month that it will return an additional $10 billion to $12 billion to shareholders between mid-year 2022 and the end of 2024.Phillips 66 BasicsPhillips 66’s diversified energy portfolio includes midstream operations, which generally features the transport and storage of crude oil before it is refined and processed. The company also runs a refining segment that turns crude into everything from fuels for transpiration to lubricants and specialty products such as petroleum coke, solvents, and other products.On top of its chemicals, refining, and specialties segment, Phillips 66 runs a successful marketing segment. The company operates Phillips 66 branded gas stations and service stations around the U.S. and beyond. Phillips 66 is also making sure it’s prepared for the expansion and likely transition to alternative fuels and energy in the coming decades and beyond.Phillips 66’s emerging energy efforts include renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture, and hydrogen. For instance, the company said recently that it’s converting its San Francisco refinery in Rodeo, California into “one of the world’s largest renewable fuels facilities,” with the project set to begin commercial operations in Q1 of 2024.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRecent Growth and Outlook Phillips 66 and others benefitted immensely from rising oil and energy prices amid the huge rebound in demand as the U.S. and economies around the globe soared back to life after the covid crash. Travel, including air, has already mounted a serious comeback and broader energy demand is returning to pre-covid levels. Plus, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to negatively impact oil and gas supplies.Story continuesEven though oil prices have come back down from their peaks of over $100 a barrel, they have hovered between roughly $80 and $90 a barrel for the last few months. Phillips 66’s revenue skyrocketed 74% last year, with its adjusted earnings up from a loss of -$0.89 per share to +$5.70 a share.Phillips 66 has topped our quarterly estimates by an average of 28% in the trailing four quarters, including a 30% third quarter beat on November 1. Management was able to raise their guidance once again for FY22 and fiscal 2023, which is no easy task amid the current environment that’s seen the wider S&amp;P 500 earnings picture fade.PSX’s four quarter and first quarter FY23 consensus estimates are now up 41% and 49%, respectively over the past 60 days. Phillips 66’s FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates have climbed by 28% and 30%, respectively during this same stretch. Zacks estimates call for its 2022 revenue to soar 47% to $169.32 billion to help boost its adjusted earnings by roughly 270% from under $6 a share all the way to $21.00 per share.Phillips 66 is currently projected to see its revenue and earnings decline on a YoY basis in 2023 as they come up against nearly impossible to compete against periods. But there is no guarantee that those estimates don’t continue to improve as they have over the last several months.  Other Fundamentals  The so-called lost decade for oil and gas companies forced everyone in the industry to reevaluate every aspect of their business, slimming down operations to run more efficiently than ever. The cost-cutting measures are now paying off in a huge way amid rebounding oil and energy prices. The trimmed down operations will also help Phillips 66 and others keep margins relatively high going forward.Phillips 66 generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations in the third quarter. This helped the company return $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases last quarter. Better yet, PSX announced during its investor day on November 9 that it plans to return an additional $10 billion to $12 billion to shareholders between mid-year 2022 and the end of 2024 via buybacks and dividends.Additionally, Phillips 66 said it will start to roll out sustainable cost reductions of $1 billion through business transformations. With this in mind, Phillips 66’s 3.6% dividend yield blows away its industry’s 2% average, as well as oil and energy titan Exxon Mobil’s XOM 3.2%. The company also has a very sustainable 22% dividend payout ratio.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPrice and Valuation PSX shares have climbed 77% in the past two years to lag behind its highly-ranked industry’s 95% but blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 10% gain. More recently, Phillips 66 shares are up 10% in the last six months to hit new 52-week highs on November 14. And its current Zacks consensus price target offers 12% upside to the roughly $108 a share it trades at right now.On the valuation front, PSX trades at 7.2X forward 12-month earnings. This represents a 30% discount to its own 12-month median. Looking back further, the nearby chart showcases that Phillips 66 trades at a 35% discount to its own decade-long median and roughly in line with the Zacks Oil and Energy sector. And PSX trades not too far above its lows of 5.9X during this stretch.Bottom LinePhillips 66’s Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry ranks in the top 7% of over 250 Zacks industries. PSX also sports “A” grades for Value, Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Its commitment to boosting its dividend should help investors as they try to fight back against ongoing inflation. And investors looking for value during the current market and economic conditions would do well to consider Phillips 66 or other oil stocks.   Phillips 66’s positive upward earnings revisions help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. Plus, the broader oil and gas sector will likely remain a major backbone of economies around the world for decades to come. And let’s remember that Phillips 66 is already preparing for an alternative fuel and energy future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is PBF Energy (PBF). PBF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 4.01 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 5.36. PBF's Forward P/E has been as high as 48.60 and as low as -4.11, with a median of 6.86, all within the past year.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PBF's P/B ratio of 1.21. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. PBF's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.10. Over the past 12 months, PBF's P/B has been as high as 2.09 and as low as 0.58, with a median of 1.03.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PBF has a P/S ratio of 0.13. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.32.Story continuesFinally, we should also recognize that PBF has a P/CF ratio of 2.09. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. PBF's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 5.27. Over the past 52 weeks, PBF's P/CF has been as high as 7.13 and as low as 1.53, with a median of 3.10.If you're looking for another solid Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing value stock, take a look at Phillips 66 (PSX). PSX is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Shares of Phillips 66 currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 7.37, and its PEG ratio is 0.43. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 5.36 and 0.48.PSX's Forward P/E has been as high as 19.08 and as low as 5.86, with a median of 10.20. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.06, as low as 0.43, with a median of 0.63.Furthermore, Phillips 66 holds a P/B ratio of 1.58 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 2.10. PSX's P/B has been as high as 2.40, as low as 1.15, with a median of 1.69 over the past 12 months.These are just a handful of the figures considered in PBF Energy and Phillips 66's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that PBF and PSX is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

106,5bb806f3-d057-335b-837f-1b63bbb2b2da,PSX,2022-11-18,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-141002293.html,1668694202,STORY,['PFE'],"[Believe it or not, seniors fear running out of cash more than they fear dying.And unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Kimco Realty (KIM) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.23 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.84%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 4.09% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.6%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 29.41%. Check Kimco Realty (KIM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;3M (MMM) is paying out a dividend of $1.49 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.73% compared to the Diversified Operations industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 0.68% over the past year. Check 3M (MMM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.4 per share, Pfizer (PFE) has a dividend yield of 3.19%. This is compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.42% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 2.56%. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amgen’s key drugs like Prolia, Repatha and Otezla are aiding sales, driven by volume growth. These drugs are gaining consistent approvals for label expansions.Moreover, Amgen is evaluating Prolia/Xgeva, Vectibix, Enbrel, Aranesp, Kyprolis, Nplate and Blincyto for additional indications. Importantly, new drugs Lumakras and Tezspire are off to an encouraging start. Lumakras (sotorasib) was approved for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the United States in May 2021 and in the EU in January 2022. It is now available in more than 45 countries. Also, label expansion studies on Lumakras, with the potential to significantly expand the currently addressable patient population, are progressing rapidly.Tezspire (tezepelumab) was approved to treat severe asthma in the United States in December 2021. Amgen has a partnership with AstraZeneca AZN for Tezspire. In September, AstraZeneca announced that Tezspire was approved in Japan and Europe. Amgen and AstraZeneca share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit inventor royalty to Amgen. While AstraZeneca leads development, Amgen leads manufacturing.Amgen is also rapidly advancing its robust pipeline of early and late-stage assets. Several phase III readouts are due in 2023, which could act as catalysts for the stock. The recent acquisition of ChemoCentryx added a strategic new growth asset in Tavneos to Amgen’s portfolioAmgen also boasts a strong biosimilars portfolio, which is an important long-term growth driver. Amgen markets Kanjinti (a biosimilar of Roche’s [RHHBY] Herceptin) and Mvasi (a biosimilar of Roche’s Avastin) in the United States and Amgevita (a biosimilar of AbbVie’s [ABBV] Humira), Kanjinti and Mvasi outside the United States. In the United States, AbbVie’s Humira biosimilar, Amjevita is expected to be launched in 2023. Amgen will be one of the first companies to launch its biosimilar of AbbVie’s Humira in early 2023.Story continuesBiosimilars of J&amp;J’s Stelara (ABP 654), Alexion’s Soliris (ABP 959) and Regeneron’s Eylea (ABP 938) are in late-stage state development. Amgen has successfully completed phase III studies for all these biosimilar candidates. Amgen’s biosimilars revenues are annualizing at over $2 billion in sales, while it is expected to more than double from 2021 to 2030, supported by Amjevita launch and other biosimilars in late-stage development.Amgen has its share of problems. Increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many of Amgen’s products, including some biosimilars. The Humira U.S. sales erosion in 2023 and increasing biosimilar competition for some other legacy products create potential revenue headwinds.Amgen’s net selling price has declined for the past few years with the trend expected to continue in 2023 due to increased competition. In addition, foreign exchange headwinds with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, increasing interest rates, persistently high inflation, supply chain pressure and the war in Europe are creating an uncertain macro environment.Nonetheless, continued strong growth of key drugs, higher sales from ex-U.S. markets, increased contribution from its high-quality biosimilars and costs savings should keep the stock afloat in 2023.Zacks RankAmgen currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

""We continue to rely heavily on markdowns and discounting to sell-through styles this quarter and have reduced receipts in Q4.""Gap's inventory ballooned 12% year over year in the third quarter amid a broader slowdown in consumer spending. Comparable sales were up a meager 1% as lower income shoppers pulled back on trips to Old Navy and consumers overall bought more cautiously on discretionary items.The aggressive posture on discounting — which will likely hammer Gap's profit margins in the critical holiday season — comes hot on the heels of another lackluster quarter and ongoing search for a permanent CEO.Net sales rose 2% from the prior year to $4.04 billion. Sales at Old Navy rose a meager 2%, while the Gap brand saw sales stay stagnant from a year ago. Sales at Athleta rose 6%.Adjusted gross profit margins tanked 320 basis points from a year ago.Gap shares managed to rise 7% in pre-market trading on Friday as earnings of 71 cents a share beat estimates for breakeven.The company said it sees fourth quarter sales falling by a mid-single digit percentage. No profit guidance was shared.""Long-term, we believe a mix shift toward Old Navy and Athleta should improve the company's margin structure. However, we think there are still risks around Old Navy maintaining its historical growth and margin rates, especially with growing competition. We believe slowing trends at Old Navy (drives ~60% of revenue and even more of profit) will be a key focus among investors near-term. While Athleta is a strong, growing brand, it is not large enough to drive the investment case at this time, in our view,"" said Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe in a note to clients.Story continuesBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

And the big takeaway so far is that shoppers are adjusting their spending habits. Today's standout is Macy's. Its third quarter was solid, sending shares up the most since May.Among the drivers here, a big beat on earnings and better-than-expected guidance. CEO Jeff Gennette saying in a statement, quote, ""We know the consumer is under increasing pressure and has a choice on where to spend."" Macy's high-end stores Bluemercury and Bloomingdale's outperforming, proving that the luxury consumer remains strong.But that certainly is not the case for middle- and lower-income consumers. Also out today, Kohl's. The department store's third-quarter earnings beat. But it pulled its fourth-quarter outlook amid some of these macroeconomic challenges. CFO Jill Timm saying on the earnings call that the retailer, quote, ""saw our middle-income customers continue to purchase fewer items per chip-- per trip and trade down.""That's similar to what we heard from Walmart earlier this week. CFO John Rainey saying that consumers are more cautious in trading down to cheaper items. A warning spending could slow this quarter, Rainey telling analysts, quote, ""Despite a good start to Q4, our guidance assumes that the consumer could slow spending, given persistent inflationary pressures in food and consumables.""And that holds true for Target as well. CEO Brian Cornell saying, quote, ""Consumers are showing increasing signs of stress and pulling back from discretionary purchases."" Obviously a huge hit here to Target in its most recent quarter, bringing up some concerns about what the holiday quarter is going to look like.And, Rachelle, we've talked about higher rates, inflation being a massive headwind here for consumers. Up until now, the consumer has been willing to stomach those higher prices. But as we continue to hear from some of these larger retailers, it seems like that narrative is starting to change.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: It is. And we're really seeing a bigger focus on what they're spending the money on. They used to, you know, use a bit of that discretionary income. But now we're seeing that they're spending on the essentials.We saw from Walmart it was the groceries that were helping their earnings, as a lot of people were looking for, you know, cheaper alternatives for food, looking for value in the sort of economy. Interesting, though, still seeing a lot of resilience for the luxury shopper. They clearly seem to be better insulated.As we were just talking about with the housing guest, that market, that demographic seems to be fine. But for people who are in the middle or lower income, they're having to make some difficult choices. And we're seeing that reflected in some of these retailers, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. And that is why Walmart has outperformed because some consumers are trading down, more people reallocating how they're spending, spending instead on groceries instead of some of those discretionary items. So we're starting to see this divergence between performance when it comes to Walmart and Target, two companies that you think would be OK in this type of environment. But Walmart clearly the out-performer up until this point.When it comes to Macy's, the jump today, 13%, was a little bit of a surprise to me, just given the slowdown that we could potentially see in this current quarter and looking out into 2023. But management there at least turning the ship a bit. At least that looks like how Wall Street is interpreting these latest results. We'll see, though, how some of these larger retailers that we haven't yet heard from that we'll get results from in the coming days in coming weeks, how they're faring up until this point.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the gambling industry and go directly to 5 Best Gambling Stocks To Buy Now.The gambling industry, like many other industries around the world, was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and still continues to be adversely affected in some regions due to travel restrictions. However, the shutting down of casinos meant that the online gambling industry saw explosive growth in its traffic as people migrated to digital platforms due to an absence of physical access to casinos. Despite the negative consequences of COVID-19, the gambling industry is set to grow as the legalization of the industry in the United States is seen as a catalyst for growth. The total addressable market of the U.S sports betting industry is estimated to reach $37 billion by 2023, expected to grow at a high CAGR of 40% from its 2019 base, as per Goldman Sachs.Photo by Kvnga on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe picked the most popular gambling and gaming stocks from the database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the third quarter.Best Gambling Stocks To Buy Now16. NeoGames S.A. (NASDAQ:NGMS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13NeoGames S.A. (NASDAQ:NGMS) is an iLottery company that operates globally and provides business-to-government (B2G) and business-to-business (B2B) solutions and services to its customers. The company extended its operations by acquiring 99.31% of Aspire Global PLC for $480 million in June 2022. The company's services include iGaming, casino games, and sports betting, which it provides through its three subsidiary companies: Aspire Global, Pariplay, and BtoBet.On October 04, 2020, NeoGames S.A. (NASDAQ:NGMS) 's subsidiary, Pariplay, was approved to operate in Connecticut. The company will now be able to run its operations in five states throughout the United States. The company is already operational in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Michigan.Story continuesAccording to Insider Monkey database, 13 hedge funds held stakes in NeoGames S.A. (NASDAQ:NGMS) at the end of the third quarter ending September 2022.In addition to NeoGames S.A. (NASDAQ:NGMS), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) are included in our list of 16 best gambling stocks to buy now.15. Genius Sports Limited (NYSE:GENI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Founded in 2001 as sports-betting data provider, Genius Sports Limited (NYSE:GENI) has transformed into a renowned sports tech company. The company provides its services to sports leagues and federations around the world by allowing them to collect and assess their data to strengthen fan engagement.On August 17, 2022, Bernie McTernan, an analyst at Needham, increased his target price on Genius Sports Limited (NYSE:GENI) to $7 after the announcement of the company's Q2 results. The analyst currently has a Buy rating on the stock and believes that Genius Sports Limited (NYSE:GENI) is continuing on its growth trajectory due to the success of the company's land and expand strategy. As per Insider Monkey database, 21 funds remained bullish on the company at the end of Q3 2022.Here is what Alger Small Cap Focus Fund has to say about Genius Sports Limited in its Q4 2021 investor letter:Genius Sports provides online sportsbooks with data from sports leagues. We view it as a picks-and-shovels sports betting company, so it isn't dependent on the success of an individual gambling operator. The global online sports betting (OSB) market is forecast to grow from approximately $31 billion in gross gaming revenue (GGR) in 2020 to approximately $65 billion in 2025, a compound annual growth rate of 16%, and we believe Genius is positioned to increase its market share. The company has a 40% to 50% market share of sports events currently and an ambitious target to reach a 5% take-rate on this global gaming market compared to its current take-rate of 1.75%. The take-rate is the portion of gross revenues generated by online gambling operators that Genius receives.Genius is levered to the U.S. sports betting total addressable market given the company's NFL data contract and in our view is well positioned to benefit from structuring of legalized OSB in New York. We believe the structure is unfavorable for online gambling operators, but could potentially be positive for providers of sports data, especially given that New York mandates the use of official data. In our view, Genius is also well positioned to benefit from the increasing importance of official data, a growing ad-tech business and the potential to cross sell additional services to sportsbooks, such as managing risk and trading of betting markets and streaming services. We see 2022 and 2023 as big launch years for online sports betting (i.e., more states legalizing OSB), which could benefit Genius because the company receives a share of operator gross gaming revenue and can monetize its services with its ad-tech business).Shares of Genius Sports were volatile during the fourth quarter due to concerns about expiry of a pre-IPO shareholder lockup that occurred in mid-November following the release of thirdquarter results. When releasing results, the company lowered its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) guidance for 2022 to just ""breakeven"" given increased investments of $30 million to $40 million. A selloff of high-growth stocks in November and December also hurt the performance of Genius Sports shares. While 2022 and 2023 are likely to involve additional investments by OSB operators to support marketing as more states legalize online gaming, we think Genius Sports is currently well positioned to benefit from the expanding U.S. total addressable market and the company's increased marketing.14. Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Limited (NASDAQ:MLCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Headquartered in Hongkong, Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Limited (NASDAQ:MLCO) develops, owns, and operates casinos in Asia and Europe.

(NYSE:VICI) to $36. The analyst currently has an Overweight rating on the company's stock. The analyst has revised his estimate for the company's adjusted funds from operation upwards, resulting in an increased price target.According to Insider Monkey database, 33hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of the September quarter.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust company specializing in casinos and other entertainment properties. We invested in VICI in 2018 when earnings were declining due to dilutive acquisitions. Our thesis was that, as investors grew more comfortable with casinos as a REIT subsector, the value of their properties would increase. We also liked the defensive characteristics of the company, specifically the triple-net lease structure, which dictates that lessees pay all maintenance and capital expenditures, and the history of casino REITs with zero rent payments missed by casinos during either the global financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic. Furthermore, we were confident that VICI's growth prospects would increase as more casinos monetized land holdings with VICI's ability to use its extensive cash and liquidity to make acquisitions. VICI's stock outperformed in the quarter due to its appeal as a fairly defensive investment and the news that it would be included in the S&amp;P 500 Index. We maintained our position in VICI.10. Bally's Corporation (NYSE:BALY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 11Bally's Corporation (NYSE:BALY) is a hospitality and casino company based out of Providence, Rhode Island, that operates across the globe. The company has been growing its business through online sports betting and iGaming. It presently owns and operates 14 casinos in 10 states, as well as a horse racetrack in Colorado, and has access to OSB licenses in 14 states.On November 03, 2022, Bally's Corporation (NYSE:BALY) reported results for Q3 2022, as it posted sales of $578.2 million for the quarter, up 83.7% YoY from the same period last year. The company posted a Normalized EPS of $0.01, missing the analysts' estimates by $0.34. The company stated that adverse impacts of COVID-related lockdowns and negative foreign exchanges impact due to the strengthening of the dollar during the quarter impacted the company's result during Q3 2022.At the end of Q3 2022, 11 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database were long on Bally's Corporation (NYSE:BALY) at the end of the quarter.9. DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is a fantasy sports betting company. The company operates in approximately 17 countries powering sports and gaming entertainment. DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) established a marketplace in August 2021, offering curated non-fungible tokens (NFT) and supporting secondary-market transactions.On November 08, 2022, Ryan Sigdahl, an analyst at Craig-Hallum, reduced his target price on the company's stock to $21. While the analyst has maintained a Buy rating on DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), he believes that the near-term challenges have increased, which were reflected in the company's recent quarterly results.As per Insider Money's proprietary database, 34 hedge funds are bullish on DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), as of the end of the third quarter.In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Shares of DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) fell in the quarter, as stocks of online gaming companies were under pressure. Sports betting and i-gaming are rolling out with great fanfare and success across the country; however, investors seem concerned about competition and margins. Most participants are spending heavily on marketing and promotions, which is cutting into margins. We see this as worthy investment in customer acquisition at a moment in time when revenues are just building. We continue to believe that online sports betting and gaming will be enormous industries, that DraftKings will be a leading player. We think the business will have high margins as it matures. We believe we are underwriting the business conservatively and see much upside in the long term.8. Light &amp; Wonder, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Light &amp; Wonder, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNW) is a cross-platform global gaming company that allows its user to play different online games. It also sells land-based casino products. Light &amp; Wonder, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GLPI) at the end of the September quarter.Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ:GLPI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ:GLPI), a gaming REIT that owns the real estate of many casino operators, contributed to performance on the strength of its well-covered dividend yield and prospects for growth even in a recessionary economy. Its tenants remain solvent and flush with cash, which suggests that rent payments should remain steady regardless of the economic environment. A strong balance sheet allows for additional acquisitions, which should be accretive to the dividend and enhance shareholder returns.6. PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN), formerly known as Penn National Gaming, offers integrated entertainment, sports content, and casino gaming throughout North America. It operates through the following business subdivision: Northeast, South, West, Midwest, and Other. The company changed its name to Penn Entertainment in August 2022, reflecting its broadening into sports content and other entertainment.On November 03, 2022, John DeCree, an analyst at CBRE, reduced his target price on PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) to $54. Although the analyst is confident about the company's ability to sustain its margins, he believes that the company reported higher-than-expected losses during Q3 2022, which led him to reduce his target price on the company.At the end of the third quarter, 30 hedge funds in Insider Monkey database were bullish on the company.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks, and Penn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) declined 28.3% in the quarter and penalized performance by 71 bps. This was due to investor concerns that a potential recession would result in a slowdown or decline in growth. The company has seen no material change to its visitation or spending levels, and its earnings remain strong. Penn is generating strong cash flow to more than offset investments in its digital growth opportunity. It is using excess cash to buy back its stock. Penn is well positioned to weather a slowdown or recession and, if one does occur, the company should still generate revenue and EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels.Management continues to use its excess cash for share repurchases and debt reduction as well as continuing investments in its digital businesses. We think the $50 million of losses this year from its digital business is modest in relation to Penn's $1 billion of casino EBITDA. The losses from its digital business represent customer acquisition costs incurred as additional states legalize online gambling.

(NYSE:SPGI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”Story continuesS&amp;P Global Inc.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this processor of debit and credit card payments have returned +15.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +10.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which MasterCard falls in, has gained 12.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, MasterCard is expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share, indicating a change of +9.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.1%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.08 indicates a change of +14.1% from what MasterCard is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, MasterCard is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of MasterCard, the consensus sales estimate of $5.77 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.5%. The $22.15 billion and $24.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.3% and +12.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMasterCard reported revenues of $5.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.37 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.66 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.77%. The EPS surprise was +4.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.MasterCard is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about MasterCard. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

132,cc8bce30-f184-35b7-8211-96f7aebe7fd7,QCOM,2022-11-18,We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM) Passed With Ease,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ran-stock-scan-earnings-growth-110022098.html,1668769222,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Quickly Is QUALCOMM Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. QUALCOMM's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 48%. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that QUALCOMM is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 6.7 percentage points to 36%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for QUALCOMM's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre QUALCOMM Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$138b company like QUALCOMM. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$160m. This comes in at 0.1% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is QUALCOMM Worth Keeping An Eye On?QUALCOMM's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering QUALCOMM for a spot on your watchlist. Even so, be aware that  QUALCOMM is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are a bit unpleasant...There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

More people than ever are working remotely, and screens have become the leading platform for learning and gaming. And this evolution has paved way to the metaverse - today, popular devices like the Meta Quest 2 seamlessly unleash you into an immersive world where you can shop, create and play games, collaborate with colleagues, explore, and more.Defining AR, VR, MR, and XRAt Qualcomm Technologies, we're making connectivity more accessible, pushing boundaries to empower you with Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR). But what do these technologies mean and how are they poised to transform your life? Here's a forward-look:AR is the technology that overlays digital content on top of the real world through a phone or a head-worn device, such as glasses or a headset.VR immerses the user in a virtual environment to create believable experiences, whether they immerse the user in a real-life situation or a creative imaginary experience.MR brings the best of both AR and VR together by capturing the real-world through a series of cameras and sensors - then projecting it on a display before your eyes. In MR, virtual objects are seamlessly integrated into reality for completely new experiences.XR refers to all the above, and the metaverse refers to the ecosystem revolving around XR. Think of a 3D internet that you could access from anywhere through a laptop, smartphone, or headset to meet with friends, work out, play, and work.Similar technology, different usageARSince AR pushes real-time, non-disruptive information to your eyes, it can deliver information so you don't need to look at your phone, which comes in handy when a glance away might be dangerous or impractical.The applications are endless. For example, an AR app might help you try on a garment from the comfort of home or see how a new piece of furniture looks in your living room.Story continuesPlus, visuals can be added upon cue to make a museum tour more meaningful and engaging, for example.And soon, cyclists, skiers, and other athletes might wonder what they ever did without the safety of AR real-time data and GPS function as it keeps their atteniton on the path ahead.Workplace benefits abound too. AR can enable remote assistance, making it easier for a technician to guide a repair process, or it can leverage precise localization data to guide technicians to the exact incident location to accelerate repair time.VRWhen you want to be fully immersed and distraction-free from the real world, VR delivers. You might use VR, for example, in gaming, working out, or training. Tripp, a recipient of the Snapdragon Metaverse-Fund, helps you mediate by providing a virtual immersive environment whereever you are - that's the beauty of VR.MRMR comes into play when you need to create an experience on top of an existing environment, without altering it in real life.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Valued at $14.1 million, the contract is expected to get completed by December 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide non-recurring engineering, supplies and support necessary for the low-rate initial production Lot 1 deployable configuration updates for the CH-53K heavy lift replacement aircraft.Work related to the deal will be carried out in West Palm Beach, FL.Benefits of the ContractCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and the integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide, is also strengthening military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Boeing BA and Textron TXT, which also have expertise in manufacturing military aircraft.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. It also enables warfighters to accomplish missions under any conditions.Story continuesNOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 sales implies growth of 1.8% from the 2021 reported figure.Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s primary products include fixed-wing military aircraft, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker, and T-7A Red Hawk. This segment also produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.BA stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 sales implies growth of 6% from the 2021 reported figure.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.TXT stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.2%.

137,110a834b-9ac7-3c94-abfd-514a865c4347,LMT,2022-11-18,Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-corporation-lmt-attracting-140002552.html,1668693602,STORY,['LMT'],"[Lockheed Martin (LMT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +10.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has gained 15.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $7.40 per share, indicating a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.67 points to a change of -4.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.59 indicates a change of +27.3% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $18.23 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $65.23 billion and $65.93 billion estimates indicate -2.7% and +1.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryLockheed reported revenues of $16.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $6.87 for the same period compares with $6.66 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.43%. The EPS surprise was +4.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Lockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NOAA administrators and researchers have to collect, combine and analyze that information to observe and understand environmental conditions and changes.The new Earth Observations Digital Twin — developed under contract with Lockheed Martin Space, working with NVIDIA — will provide NOAA with a high-resolution, accurate and timely depiction of global conditions, using current satellite and ground-based observations.For the project, Lockheed Martin’s OpenRosetta3D™ platform will utilize AI and Machine Learning (ML) to ingest, format and fuse observations from multiple sources into a gridded data product and detect anomalies. NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus, the collaboration and database engine of its Omniverse world simulation platform, will convert data into the Universal Scene Description framework, enabling data-sharing across multiple tools and between researchers. Agatha, a Lockheed Martin-developed visualization platform, will ingest this incoming data from Omniverse Nucleus and allow users to interact with it in an Earth-centric 3D environment.“At Lockheed Martin we regularly use digital twins and AI to provide our government customers with the clearest, current situational picture and actionable intelligence for their important missions,” said Matt Ross, senior program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. “We’re pleased that we can use our technology experience to collaborate with NVIDIA on this project to provide NOAA a timely, global visualization for their own important missions.”Story continues“Digital twins will help us solve the world’s hardest scientific and environmental challenges,” said Dion Harris, lead product manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. “The combination of Lockheed Martin’s AI technology with NVIDIA Omniverse will give NOAA researchers a powerful system to improve weather predictions at a global scale.”Lockheed Martin and NVIDIA are already collaborating on an effort to help fight wildfires, which have burned more than 7.2 million U.S. acres this year. By pairing Lockheed Martin’s AI/ML platforms and joint all domain command and control capabilities with NVIDIA’s Omniverse, the two companies are demonstrating how firefighters can use advanced technology to help better detect, predict and suppress wildfires.About Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.Please follow @LMNews and @LMSpace on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation.About NVIDIASince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

(NYSE:BAX) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.29 per share on the 3rd of January. This means the dividend yield will be fairly typical at 2.1%. Check out our latest analysis for Baxter International Baxter International's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Baxter International is not generating a profit, and despite this is paying out most of its free cash flow as a dividend. Generally it is unsustainable for a company to be paying a dividend while unprofitable, and with limited reinvestment into the business growth may be slow.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 17%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $1.34, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.16. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 1.4% per year. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Baxter International's EPS has fallen by approximately 12% per year during the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.Baxter International's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The track record isn't great, and the payments are a bit high to be considered sustainable. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

Shares have added about 5.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Johnson &amp; Johnson due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Beats on Q3 Earnings, Cuts 2022 Sales View on Fx WoesJ&amp;J’s third-quarter 2022 earnings came in at $2.55 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.49. Earnings declined 1.9% from the year-ago period. Earnings slightly missed our estimates of $2.57 per share.Adjusted earnings exclude intangible amortization and some other special items. Including these items, J&amp;J reported third-quarter earnings of $1.68 per share, up 22.6% from the year-ago quarter.Sales came in at $23.8 billion, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.28 billion as well as our estimates of $23.64 billion. Sales rose 1.9% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 8.1% and a negative currency impact of 6.2%.Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 8.2% on an operational basis compared with an 8.1% increase in the previous quarter.Third-quarter sales in the domestic market rose 4.1% to $12.45 billion. International sales declined 0.3% on a reported basis to $11.3 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 12.3%, which was more than offset by a negative currency impact of 12.6%. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an adjusted operational basis, international sales rose 12.4% in the quarter.In the quarter, J&amp;J accelerated operational sales growth across all three segments despite macroeconomic pressure.Its Pharmaceuticals unit sales continued to post above-market adjusted operational sales growth despite the negative currency impact. Sales also improved in the MedTech and Consumer segments.Story continuesSegment DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales rose 2.6% year over year to $13.21 billion, reflecting 9% operational growth and a 6.4% negative currency impact. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 9.2%. Pharmaceutical segment sales exceeded our estimates of $13.16 billion as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.09 billion.Sales in the domestic market rose 3% to $7.44 billion. International sales rose 2% to $6.78 billion (operational increase of 16.7%).The year-over-year sales increase was led by higher penetration and new indications across key products, such as Darzalex and Stelara. Other core products like Invega Sustenna and relatively newer drugs, Erleada and Tremfya contributed significantly to sales growth. Sales of J&amp;J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine was less than in the previous quarter. The sales growth was also dampened by lower sales of key medicine, Imbruvica and generic/biosimilar competition to drugs like Zytiga and Remicade.Darzalex sales rose 29.8% year over year to $2.05 billion in the quarter, which matched our estimates.Stelara sales grew 3% to $2.45 billion in the quarter, driven by strong market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, partially offset by an unfavorable prior period adjustment. Stelara sales were slightly less than our estimate of $2.63 billion.Imbruvica sales declined 14.6% to $911 million due to increased competitive pressure in the United States from novel oral agents. Imbruvica sales also missed our estimates of $952.8 million. While below pre-COVID levels in CLL market hurt sales in the United States, government clawbacks hurt sales in Europe. PAH revenues of $852 million declined 1.9% year over year. Invega Sustenna/Xeplion/Invega Trinza/Trevicta sales rose 2.6% to $1.03 billion in the quarter. Simponi/Simponi Aria sales declined 4.6% to $545 million, while Prezista sales decreased 6.4% to $485 million.  Xarelto sales rose 8.4% in the quarter to $689 million while sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 18.4% to $109 million.Among the newer medicines, Erleada generated sales of $490 million in the quarter, up 42.2% year over year. Tremfya recorded sales of $729 million in the quarter, up 35.9% year over year driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications.Zytiga sales declined 16.7% to $456 million in the quarter due to generic competition. Zytiga lost exclusivity in EMEA markets in September, which is likely to hurt sales further in the fourth quarter. Sales of Remicade were down 26.6% in the quarter to $558 million.J&amp;J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine generated sales of $489 million in the third quarter compared with $544 million in the second quarter. International sales accounted for all the COVID-19 vaccine sales. We expected COVID-19 vaccine sales of $224.3 million for the third quarter.Excluding COVID-19 vaccine, sales in the Pharmaceutical segment rose 2.8%, as an operational increase of 8.9% was offset by a negative currency movement of 6.1%.J&amp;J continues to expect its Pharmaceutical business to deliver market-leading adjusted operational sales growth in 2023 despite the Stelara loss of exclusivity in the second half in the United States.The MedTech segment sales came in at $6.78 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago period, as an operational increase of 8.1% was offset by a negative currency movement of 6.0%. The MedTech segment sales were in line with our as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.78 billion.Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 8.1%.Sales in the MedTech segment continued to improve, driven by a recovery in surgical procedures, better commercial execution and new product launches. However, sales were partly hurt by volume-based procurement (VBP) issues in China and unfavorable timing of international tenders, primarily in orthopedics and supply constraints.Interventional Solutions grew 10.8% driven by electrophysiology products. In Surgery, Advanced Surgery declined 1.2% worldwide. General Surgery rose 0.3% worldwide. Worldwide orthopedics rose 0.1%.  Worldwide Vision grew 1.4%, driven by the strong performance of contact lenses.Domestic market sales rose 7.7% year over year to $3.36 billion. International market sales declined 2.9% year over year to $3.43 billion, which included an operational increase of 8.5% and a negative currency impact of 11.4%.In the MedTech segment, J&amp;J expects continued recovery in worldwide procedure volumes, better execution and uptake from recently launched products to drive sales in 2023. However, the lingering headwinds from hospital staffing and some impact from the VBP program in China are expected to hurt sales in 2023.The Consumer Health segment recorded revenues of $3.8     billion in the reported quarter, down 0.4% year over year, reflecting a 4.7% operational increase and a 5.1% negative currency impact. Consumer segment sales came ahead of our as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.70 billion.Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 4.8% worldwide.The sales growth was driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to a strong cold, cough and flu season and higher international sales in Neutrogena and Aveeno due to market growth and new product launches. This growth was partially offset by supply constraints in the United States (due to raw material availability and labor shortages) and sales suspension of personal care products in Russia.Sales in the domestic market rose 2.1% from the year-ago period to $1.63 billion. The international segment declined 2.3% to $2.14 billion, which included an operational increase of 6.7% and a negative currency impact of 9.0%.In the Consumer segment, J&amp;J expects reduction in supply chain disruptions and strategic price increases to benefit results in 2023 although some challenges like inflationary pressure and higher input costs are expected to continue.2022 OutlookJ&amp;J lowered its sales expectations for 2022 mainly due to currency headwinds. It also tightened its adjusted earnings guidance range.J&amp;J expects to generate revenues in the range of $93.0 billion to $93.5 billion, lower than the previous expectation of $93.3 billion to $94.3 billion. This guidance excludes any revenues from J&amp;J’s COVID-19 vaccine. Revenue growth is expected in the range of 1.8%-2.3% compared with 2.1%-3.1%, expected previously.Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, operational constant-currency sales are expected to increase in the range of 6.7%-7.2% compared with 6.5%-7.5% expected previously.The adjusted operational sales (excluding currency impact, acquisitions/divestitures) growth guidance is the same as the operational constant-currency sales discussed above.The adjusted earnings per share guidance was tightened from a range of $10.00-$10.10 per share to $10.02-$10.07 per share. Adjusted EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately 68 cents per share due to currency headwinds. The earnings range indicates an increase of 2.3%-2.8%, compared with 2.1%-3.1% expected previously. On an operational, constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase 9.2% – 9.7% versus the prior expectation of 8.7% – 9.7%Operating margins are expected to decline 50 bps from 2021 levels versus the prior expectation of remaining flat due to the impact of inflationary pressure. In 2023, management expects currency headwinds and the KenVue Consumer Health separation to put pressure on operating margins.  J&amp;J expects supply constraints, inflationary pressure and rising input costs to continue to hurt margins in the second half of 2022 as well as in 2023Other income is expected to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion versus the prior expectation of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Adjusted tax rate guidance was maintained in the range of 15.0% to 15.5%.Management expects an unfavorable currency impact of $4.5 billion on revenues and 68 cents on adjusted EPS in 2022. In 2023, the negative currency impact is expected to be 40-45 cents on adjusted EPS, 10 cents more than the prior expectation of 30-35 cents.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision flatlined during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally.With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver. It is presently approved to treat six indications in earlier-stage cancers in the United States. Merck expects over half of Keytruda’s growth to come from indications in early-stage (neoadjuvant/adjuvant) treatment settings in the United States through 2025 and to represent roughly 25% of total global Keytruda sales by that time.Alliance revenues from Lynparza and Lenvima are also boosting Merck’s oncology sales.Please note that Merck markets Lynparza in partnership with AstraZeneca AZN.AstraZeneca and Merck had formed the profit-sharing deal to co-market Lynparza and Koselugo in July 2017.AstraZeneca and Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, namely, ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is being evaluated in combination with Keytruda for colorectal cancer and lung cancer indications.Beyond oncology, which is expected to drive durable growth into the next decade, Merck has important products in its portfolio, including the Gardasil vaccine to prevent HPV-related cancers. Sales of the Gardasil vaccine grew 31% in the first nine months of 2022. Merck expects Gardasil growth to benefit from increased supply as it is investing in expanding manufacturing capacity. Merck expects Gardasil sales to potentially double by 2030 compared to the 2021 level.Story continuesMerck’s Animal Health business has been a key contributor to its top-line growth with the company recording above-market growth. The trend is expected to continue in 2023.Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics’ COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio has been a key top-line driver so far in 2022. However, sales are expected to be much lower in 2023 as the impact of the pandemic potentially declines.Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.Merck does have its share of problems like generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.Key diabetes medicines, Januvia and Janumet will lose market exclusivity in the United States in January 2023. Januvia lost exclusivity in several markets in Europe in September 2022 while the additional exclusivity of Janumet expires in April 2023. Sales of the drugs are expected to decline significantly thereafter.Nonetheless, strong sales of key products like Keytruda and Gardasil, a significant contribution from the Animal Health franchise and positive pipeline/regulatory developments can keep the stock afloat in 2023.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMerck currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some other stocks worth considering in the drugs/biotech sector are Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX and Gilead Sciences GILD, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ stock has risen 39.1% this year.

Due to industry-wide price competition among generic pharmaceutical companies and consolidation of buyers, Sandoz experienced significant declines in sales and profits, particularly in the United States. The spin-off is likely to be completed by the first half of 2023.The separation will enable Novartis to focus better on its legacy pharmaceutical business. Novartis had earlier spun off its eye care division, Alcon into a new company.Novartis’ ophthalmology franchise is primarily dependent on Lucentis, which the company markets with Roche RHHBY. However, Lucentis sales are declining in Europe and Japan due to biosimilar launches. The uptake of recently approved Beovu, another ophthalmology drug, has not been encouraging due to concerns over potential side effects.Per the report, the ophthalmology business alone could fetch about $5 billion.Novartis’ respiratory franchise is primarily dependent on Xolair, which is also facing stiff competition.  Novartis has a collaboration with Roche for XolairShares of Novartis have lost 4.5% so far this year against the industry’s growth of 4.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNovartis is shifting its portfolio of medicines toward biologics and technology platforms. Novartis has prioritized three newer platforms – gene &amp; cell therapy, radioligand therapy and xRNA – for continued investment in new R&amp;D capabilities and manufacturing scale, in addition to two established platforms in chemistry and biotherapeutics.Story continuesIn 2021, Novartis sold its 33% stake in Roche for $20.7 billion. The company has been a shareholder of RHHBY since May 2001. Novartis was reportedly looking for strategic acquisitions in the pharma space using the cash proceeds from its stake sale in Roche.Novartis’ performance in the third quarter was pretty ho-hum as earnings beat by a penny but revenues lagged due to generic competition. With the planned spinoff of Sandoz, Novartis is looking to become a pure-play pharmaceutical company. Drugs like Cosentyx, Entresto, Kesimpta, Zolgensma, Kisqali and Leqvio should continue to fuel growth and offset the impact of generic competition.Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  A couple of better-ranked stocks in the healthcare space include Merck MRK and Biogen BIIB. Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

To skip our analysis of the recent market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World.The Fertilizer Industry: An AnalysisThe growing global population, climate change, and water scarcity problems have joined forces to put a strain on the production of agricultural products globally. With a growing demand, the need to generate higher crop yields from the existing arable land is rising. This is where fertilizer companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (NYSE:ADM), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) enter the picture. For healthy growth, plants require three main nutrients: Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK). Farmers use fertilizers to fill the soil deficiencies in these nutrients for healthy growth of their crops.Before we delve into the recent market trends for the fertilizer industry, we need to understand the basics of how fertilizers are made. Basic Nitrogen-based fertilizers, such as urea, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), and ammonium nitrate, require ammonia as a feedstock, produced most commonly from natural gas, and coal, in some cases. On the other hand, Phosphorus and Potassium based fertilizers require mineral deposits of these elements.Fertilizer prices have risen significantly in the recent past and may remain elevated at least in the near-term. Urea prices surpassed their 2008 peaks, while phosphates and potash prices are close to 2008 levels, according to the World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook. The Russia-Ukraine conflict led to sanctions on Russia and Belarus, the two leading producers of fertilizers. The crisis was further exacerbated with the reduction in ammonia production due to higher natural gas prices. In addition, China, the largest producer of Nitrogen and Phosphorus, imposed export restrictions to cater to domestic demand.We have picked the top 15 fertilizer companies based on their market capitalization that are involved in the production and delivery of fertilizers. These companies are some of the largest producers of fertilizers worldwide, with products including nitrogen, potash, and phosphate-based commodity fertilizers, as well as complex and specialty fertilizers.Story continuesApart from the public companies included in this list, there are several privately-owned or state-owned companies that hold a significant market share in the fertilizer industry. Belarus-based Belaruskali OAO is the world’s second largest producer of potash. Prior to the sanctions imposed on the country, the company, through state-owned Belarusian Potash Company, exported more than 10 million tons of its products per annum to 140 countries globally. China, Brazil, and India were its major customers.Moscow-based UralChem is a privately-owned producer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. It is the second largest ammonium nitrate producer in the world with production capabilities of 2.7 million tons of ammonium nitrate, 2.2 million tons of ammonia, 0.8 million tons of MAP and DAP, 0.8 million tons of complex fertilizers and 0.5 million tons of urea.EuroChem is a privately-held vertically integrated fertilizer producer with mining assets in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Brazil, production assets across four continents, and a global sales and distribution network.

This is the first rigorous and systematic comparison of various genomic measures from circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for multi-cancer early detection (MCED) testing, and the largest comprehensive genome-wide comparison of cfDNA approaches. Findings were published online in Cancer Cell in a manuscript titled ""Evaluation of Cell-Free DNA Approaches for Multi-Cancer Early Detection.""""Results from the CCGA study formed the basis for how we developed and refined the Galleri test—it’s our origin story and the foundation of our work to transform cancer care with a simple blood test,"" said Amoolya Singh, Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Data Science and Chief Scientific Officer at GRAIL. ""This defining study made it possible to carefully design a population screening test with a high specificity and low false-positive rate for cancer detection. When combined with standard screenings, this test has the potential to improve detection of cancer in asymptomatic individuals.""The CCGA Discovery Substudy, the first of three pre-planned substudies of the case-controlled CCGA study, evaluated multiple potential approaches to blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) in a cohort of 2,800 individuals. These approaches included whole-genome sequencing, whole-genome methylation sequencing, and ultra deep targeted sequencing. Together this covered eight classifiers including methylation, somatic copy number alterations, somatic mutations, and a ninth pan-feature classifier. Criteria for evaluation included sensitivity (a test’s ability to correctly identify people with cancer) at high (98%) specificity (a test’s ability to correctly identify people without cancer) and cancer signal origin prediction (a test’s ability to predict the anatomical localization or cell of origin of the detected cancer signal).Story continuesThe CCGA Discovery Substudy showed that among the evaluated classifiers, those using whole-genome methylation had one of the highest cancer signal detection sensitivities at 98% specificity. Additionally, out of the evaluated approaches, whole-genome methylation had the best predicted cancer signal origin.Findings from CCGA Discovery, along with the other substudies, were instrumental in developing, refining and validating the targeted methylation platform used in the Galleri® MCED test, which applies next-generation genomic sequencing, advanced data science and machine learning to detect a shared cancer signal across more than 50 types of cancer at 99.5% specificity and accurately predict where the signal originated in the body through a simple blood draw. Test performance was consistent in the interventional PATHFINDER study, which was recently presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2022.CCGA Discovery evaluated various cfDNA measures in three prototype assays and nine prototype machine learning classifiers to determine the most promising approach for an MCED test with a low false-positive rate and sufficient sensitivity to improve outcomes for individuals who undergo screening. The substudy included 2,800 participants—1,628 with cancer and 1,172 without cancer (non-cancer). Blood samples from individuals with cancer were demographically matched to non-cancer individuals to reduce statistical uncertainty. Patients with cancer diagnosed by screening or by clinical presentation were enrolled before starting definitive therapy.The substudy implemented innovations in cancer detection evaluation, including study design, custom distributed and cloud computing, and the introduction of a novel measure: circulating tumor DNA allele fraction, defined as the fraction of tumor-distinguishing methylation marks in a cfDNA sample (i.e., the available signal). Furthermore, it introduced the metric of clinical limit of detection (cLOD) to measure cancer detection as a function of cfDNA tumor fraction—a more robust performance metric than sensitivity, which is highly dependent on study cancer type and stage composition.""To be able to meaningfully compare ct-DNA assays in the future, the clinical limit of detection must be assessed,"" added Singh. ""The CCGA Discovery analysis is the first direct head-to-head comparison of multiple approaches that we are aware of. Notably, CCGA Discovery identified methylation features in ct-DNA as having the leading combination of cancer detection and cancer signal origin performance. This motivated the development of an improved targeted methylation platform that underlies Galleri today with substantially improved performance.""About the CCGA StudyThe CCGA study is a prospective, multi-center, case-controlled, longitudinal study designed to characterize the landscape of genomic cancer signals in the blood of people with and without cancer.The study is collecting de-identified biospecimens and clinical data from more than 15,000 participants across 142 sites in the U.S. and Canada, including both people who had cancer at the time of enrollment (newly diagnosed, and not yet received treatment) and people who did not have a known cancer diagnosis. Participants will be followed annually for up to five years. A separate pre-specified substudy from CCGA involving 4,077 participants was previously published in the Annals of Oncology in September, 2021.About GRAIL’s MCED Clinical Development ProgramThe Galleri clinical development program consists of studies that collectively include more than 335,000 participants together with what is believed to be the largest linked datasets of genomic and clinical data in the field of cancer research. GRAIL’s program includes the foundational CCGA development and validation study, the interventional PATHFINDER and PATHFINDER 2 studies, the NHS-Galleri randomized, controlled clinical study, the STRIVE and SUMMIT observational studies, and the REFLECTION real-world registry. The largest of these, the NHS-Galleri trial, has enrolled 140,000 participants with the primary objective of a reduction in late-stage cancer diagnoses, thought to be a necessary prerequisite for ascertaining a mortality reduction.About GRAILGRAIL is a healthcare company whose mission is to detect cancer early, when it can be cured. GRAIL is focused on alleviating the global burden of cancer by developing pioneering technology to detect and identify multiple deadly cancer types early. The company is using the power of next-generation sequencing, population-scale clinical studies, and state-of-the-art computer science and data science to enhance the scientific understanding of cancer biology, and to develop its multi-cancer early detection blood test. GRAIL is headquartered in Menlo Park, CA with locations in Washington, D.C., North Carolina, and the United Kingdom. GRAIL, LLC, is a subsidiary of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) currently held separate from Illumina Inc. under the terms of the Interim Measures Order of the European Commission.For more information, visit grail.com.About Galleri®The earlier that cancer is detected, the higher the chance of successful outcomes. The Galleri multi-cancer early detection test can detect signals across more than 50 types of cancer, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, through a routine blood draw. When a cancer signal is detected, the Galleri test predicts the cancer signal origin, or where the cancer is located in the body, with high accuracy to help guide the next steps to diagnosis. The Galleri test requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider and should be used in addition to recommended cancer screenings such as mammography, colonoscopy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, or cervical cancer screening. It is intended for use in people with an elevated risk of cancer, such as those aged 50 or older.For more information about Galleri, visit galleri.com.Important Galleri Safety InformationThe Galleri test is recommended for use in adults with an elevated risk for cancer, such as those aged 50 or older. The Galleri test does not detect all cancers and should be used in addition to routine cancer screening tests recommended by a healthcare provider. Galleri is intended to detect cancer signals and predict where in the body the cancer signal is located. Use of Galleri is not recommended in individuals who are pregnant, 21 years old or younger, or undergoing active cancer treatment.Results should be interpreted by a healthcare provider in the context of medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. A test result of ""No Cancer Signal Detected"" does not rule out cancer. A test result of ""Cancer Signal Detected"" requires confirmatory diagnostic evaluation by medically established procedures (e.g., imaging) to confirm cancer.If cancer is not confirmed with further testing, it could mean that cancer is not present or testing was insufficient to detect cancer, including due to the cancer being located in a different part of the body. False-positive (a cancer signal detected when cancer is not present) and false-negative (a cancer signal not detected when cancer is present) test results do occur. Rx only.Laboratory/Test InformationGRAIL’s clinical laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and accredited by the College of American Pathologists.

If you want to see more names in this portfolio, check out Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Investment Portfolio: Top 5 Companies. GV, previously named Google Ventures, is the venture capital investment arm of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), which was founded in 2009 by Bill Maris. GV provides seed, venture, and growth stage funding to startups in the Internet, software, life science, healthcare, artificial intelligence, transportation, cyber security, and agriculture sectors. Though tech companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have well-rounded investment divisions, others may not be as committed to their venture arms. With a US recession on the horizon, some venture capitalists are hesitant to keep pouring into startups while their own revenues and profits are dwindling. GV currently has more than $8 billion in assets under management, with over 400 active portfolio investments across North America and Europe. Some of its prominent investment outcomes include Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLB), and Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV). To date, 65 of Alphabet-backed startups have had successful initial public offerings and 175 companies have been part of prominent M&amp;A agreements.Our Methodology We used Alphabet's latest SEC filings and picked GV Management's investments dated November 15 to assess the biggest investments of the firm. The following list is ranked according to GV’s stake value in each firm. Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Investment Portfolio: Top 15 CompaniesPhoto by Kai Wenzel on UnsplashAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Investment Portfolio: Top Companies15. Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN)Stake Value as of November 15: $9,858,000Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a California-based company that provides sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic and genomic analysis. The genomic solutions are utilized in research and clinical settings for life sciences, oncology, reproductive health, agriculture, and other emerging applications.Story continuesThe venture capital arm of Google first invested in Grail, an American biotechnology company focusing on developing an early cancer screening test for people who do not have active symptoms. In September 2020, Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) announced an agreement to purchase Grail for $7.1 billion. Currently, Alphabet’s GV Management holds a stake worth nearly $10 million in Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN). Like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLB), and Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV), Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is one of the premier holdings in the Alphabet investment portfolio. Polen Capital made the following comment about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) has had a very difficult year on what we believe are transitory issues. First, the company closed its acquisition of Grail, a startup early-stage cancer testing business it re-acquired (Grail was founded inside Illumina originally) for $8 billion without regulatory approval. Illumina management believes that European regulators have no jurisdiction over the transaction as Grail had no European presence or revenue and member states did not complain within the timeframe specified in applicable regulations. The regulators have challenged these assertions and are likely to try to require Illumina to divest Grail subject to Illumina’s appeal. In the meantime, Grail has already been very dilutive to Illumina’s earnings, and Illumina may have to sell the asset at the end of it all. It is unknown how much Grail could be sold for in this environment if Illumina is forced to divest.Second, Illumina’s core sequencing business has also slowed. This is not unusual as the business has always been a bit lumpy, but there are new competitors trying to prove that they can sequence genomes cheaper than Illumina without sacrificing accuracy. Our research here suggests: 1) competitor technologies do not seem to be as cost-effective or accurate in the real world as advertised, providing limited risk to Illumina’s core business; 2) Illumina has unveiled its own next-generation technology, which lowers the cost of sequencing the human genome to only $200, including data processing costs with world-class accuracy; 3) the slowdown in the core business is more macroeconomic as customers are looking to reduce consumables inventory levels in tough times and should pass quite quickly considering customers are continuing to use their sequencers at high levels; and 4) even if Illumina were forced to divest Grail, we think they would likely be able to sell it for above what it purchased it for as all of the clinical data on the company’s Galleri cancer screen is now publicly available (it is very positive in our view). Grail has made significant commercial progress since its acquisition, and the company should only be closer to U.S. regulatory approval. We believe we can buy the shares today at an extremely cheap valuation for the core business of a company that we view as having an unmatched position in a market that should be multiples of its current size in the years to come.”14. IDEAYA Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDYA)Stake Value as of November 15: $10,394,000IDEAYA Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDYA) was incorporated in 2015 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.

As of November 15, Alphabet’s GV held a stake worth $18.5 million in Toast, Inc. (NYSE:TOST). Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund has to say about Toast, Inc. (NYSE:TOST) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Toast, Inc. is a cloud-based end-to-end technology platform purpose-built for the restaurant industry. Its platform provides a comprehensive suite of cloud software products and financial technology solutions to its customers to connect front-of-house with back-of-house operations across all customer channels. Toast’s core module is its point-of-sale software solution and requires all customers to use Toast as their payment processor. Customers then have the option to bundle or add-on additional modules across operations, digital ordering and delivery, marketing and loyalty, team management, and back office. Toast today powers 48,000 restaurants within the 860,000 U.S. restaurant industry, largely focusing on small- and medium-sized (“SMB”) restaurant customers (generally fewer than 10 locations but up to 50), with some larger enterprise customers as well. Toast is the clear market leader in SMB restaurant technology with the best product offering and only full, end-to-end platform. We believe that as restaurants continue to invest in technology at an accelerated pace emerging from COVID, Toast will be a big beneficiary given its leading market position and best-in-class product. At less than 6% penetration of U.S. restaurants and 3% penetration of its $15 billion recurring-revenue TAM, Toast has a long runway for growth by signing on additional locations to the platform and increasing the attach rate of its value-add modules. Only 54% of customers today use 4 or more of Toast’s 10-plus modules, each of which provide significant value to the customer and would drive Toast’s recurring revenue stream higher.”8.

(NYSE:TEL) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-124-te-connectivity-ltd-122431241.html,1668774271,STORY,['TEL'],"[TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at TE Connectivity’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity What's The Opportunity In TE Connectivity?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 1.9% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TE Connectivity today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $126.85, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that TE Connectivity’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of TE Connectivity look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of TE Connectivity, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 8.4%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TEL’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TEL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

159,0b8b3918-2447-3823-9b2f-43589e05f019,NOC,2022-11-18,Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 86% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-grumman-corporation-nyse-noc-110049036.html,1668769249,STORY,['NOC'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 86% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Northrop Grumman. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Northrop Grumman?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Northrop Grumman does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Northrop Grumman, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Northrop Grumman. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.3% and 7.9% of the stock.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Northrop GrummanWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Northrop Grumman Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$145m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Northrop Grumman. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Northrop Grumman better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Northrop Grumman , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Strength in the deposit balance will aid the bank’s liquidity position. The company’s solid liquidity position will help to meet its debt obligations if the economic situation worsens.

Recovery in commercial flight hours is driving revenues at the Aerospace segment, while the Building Technologies segment is benefiting from commercial actions and strength in building products and building solutions. The company’s measures to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging.Story continuesHowever, supply chain constraints, labor market challenges and inflationary pressures are hurting the company’s operations.

The Zacks analyst believes that Northrop Grumman has developed into one of the top largest U.S. defense contractors in terms of revenues, with a major platform-centric focus. It continues to witness strong demand for its products, driven by programs like F-35, Triton and SABR radar Global Hawk and the E-2D program. Solid U.S. budgetary provisions make one confident about a solid inflow of contracts from Pentagon for it. It also holds a strong solvency position, at least in the short term. Its shares have outperformed the industry in the past year.However, a comparative analysis of the stock’s trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause of concern.

162,95b45e8d-8a76-3930-abf7-0cf063dd7cbb,NOC,2022-11-18,Lockheed (LMT) Secures Contract to Support CH-53K Aircraft,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-lmt-secures-contract-support-145602379.html,1668696962,STORY,"['LMT', 'TXT', 'NOC', 'BA']","[Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT business unit, Sikorsky, recently clinched a modification contract involving the CH-53K helicopter. The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Valued at $14.1 million, the contract is expected to get completed by December 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide non-recurring engineering, supplies and support necessary for the low-rate initial production Lot 1 deployable configuration updates for the CH-53K heavy lift replacement aircraft.Work related to the deal will be carried out in West Palm Beach, FL.Benefits of the ContractCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and the integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide, is also strengthening military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Boeing BA and Textron TXT, which also have expertise in manufacturing military aircraft.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. It also enables warfighters to accomplish missions under any conditions.Story continuesNOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.9%.

This segment also produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.BA stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 sales implies growth of 6% from the 2021 reported figure.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft preferred for training and attack missions.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221117005260/en/How inflation is diverting investment dollars. Who's doomscrolling? (Graphic: Wells Fargo)Investors are so nervous that two out of five (42%) admit they want to cash out of their investments, and more than one in four (29%) would cash out their IRA or 401(k) investments if they could do so without tax penalties.Inflation is cutting into household budgets, with a quarter of Americans with money in the stock market moving investing dollars into everyday essentials like groceries, gas, and housing. One in four (25%) are putting less into the stock market because they need to budget their cash for regular household expenses.The top five budget areas in need of cash are:Groceries (58%)Transportation and gas (47%)Utility bills (42%)Debt (39%)Housing (34%)A full two-thirds of investors say they’re ""doomscrolling,"" or continually checking their investments on their phone when the market is going down. 27% of women respondents and 50% of men check the value of their investments multiple times per week.Americans with money in the stock market see inflation as the biggest threat to their investments, with two-thirds (65%) saying lower inflation would make them feel more confident. More confidence would also come from interest rates declining (44%); decreased gas prices (41%); the war in Ukraine ending (35%); a shift in U.S. politics (34%); an end to U.S. labor shortages (20%); and a cure for COVID-19 (15%).""Uncertainty on so many levels can cause people to focus in on their present self, or immediate needs and circumstances – and to lose focus on their future self, or more strategic priorities like retirement readiness,"" said Michael Liersch, head of Advice and Planning in Wells Fargo’s Wealth &amp; Investment Management business. ""The irony is that this is the moment when we need to keep balance between our present and future selves, and potentially even dedicate more, not less, to our future selves.""Story continues""When you pull money out of your retirement accounts, you’ve locked in market declines. When you hold your money in cash, you forgo potential future investment returns. Remaining balanced in your approach may help you achieve short- and long-term financial success. Saving and investing is not a light switch that you turn on and off, it’s better thought of as a dimmer switch that you should regularly revisit and dial up or down based on your present and future needs,"" he said.Investor knowledge is key to participation ratesIn addition to inflation, another barrier cited keeping people wary of the market is a lack of investing knowledge, with fewer than half (44%) feeling confident in knowing where to invest in today’s market. Even fewer (40%) would give themselves an A or B grade in terms of their investment knowledge.More than one-third of all Americans (36%) do not have any money in the stock market. Among Americans without money in the stock market:Two out of three (68%) say they are unwilling to risk their moneyThree out of five (61%) believe it is not worth investing without a lot of moneyOne-half (50%) cite lack of knowledge as a barrier to investingOne-quarter (27%) believe that making money in the stock market is mostly a matter of luckThe study also revealed that many investors (57%) feel overwhelmed by investment options and need advice. Two-thirds (66%) want a second opinion from others before buying or selling an investment. While financial advisors, financial institutions, and family are the top resources that investors turn to for advice, those resources vary by generation.Gen Zers turn to family (50%), followed by social media sites such as YouTube and TikTok (44%)Millennials largely rely on family (52%)Gen Xers and baby boomers say financial advisors are key (46% and 55%, respectively)One in ten (10%) of investors feel they have no one to turn to for financial advice""When people think about the younger generations, they often think of them as DIY (do it yourself) individuals,"" said Liersch. ""Our data show that nothing could be further from the truth. Human beings not only want advice from their device – whether it’s on YouTube or TikTok – but from human beings as well, regardless of age.""Whether it’s family or a financial advisor, they’re trying to turn to someone for help. Digital advice serves to enable the information flow to inspire them to use their money more wisely or verify and validate what they’ve heard from others. It also helps people execute on their ideas in a quick and efficient way, whether that’s self-directed, with a professional advisor, or both. That said, it appears that people still continue to value human advice.""Some see opportunity and will find money to investOn the other end of the spectrum, almost one in five investors (18%) want to take advantage of the down market and free up money in their budget to invest more. The top five budget areas where investors are cutting back in order to invest more are:Entertainment (55%)Personal spending, such as clothing (46%)Restaurants (45%)Travel and vacations (36%)Online subscriptions (28%)About the studyVersta Research conducted a national online survey of 2,000 U.S. adults, of whom 1,163 have money invested in the stock market. The survey was conducted September 21–27, 2022. Sampling was stratified, and final data were weighted to match current U.S. Census estimates for the adult population based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, income, and education.

That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Kimco Realty (KIM) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.23 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.84%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 4.09% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.6%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 29.41%. Check Kimco Realty (KIM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;3M (MMM) is paying out a dividend of $1.49 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.73% compared to the Diversified Operations industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 0.68% over the past year. Check 3M (MMM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.4 per share, Pfizer (PFE) has a dividend yield of 3.19%. This is compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.42% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 2.56%. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Most people rarely keep cash on their person, much less at home. However, there are always unexpected events that can lead to a necessity for having a bit of cash on hand, particularly emergencies ranging from catastrophic weather (hurricanes, wildfire), to power outages. If you can’t access your digital currency or your banking systems are down, having cash can allow you to get gas, food, and medicines with ease.See the List: GOBankingRates’ Best Banks of 2023Advice: With a Recession Looming, Make These 3 Retirement Moves To Stay On TrackHowever, just how much cash should you have on hand? We asked experts to weigh in and the answer is: It depends.Keep Cash to a MinimumFrom a security point of view, cash is the most insecure asset you can have. Keeping it to a minimum in the house in the case of fire or theft is a good rule of thumb, said Ryan McCarty, CFP from McCarty Money Matters.Just how minimum is up for debate among financial experts. Danielle Miura, CFP, the founder and owner of Spark Financials, suggested, “You should keep enough money on hand to get you a couple of gallons of gas, pay for a delivery tip, or to help in unfortunate events,” or around $100-$200 at a time. “Emergency funds should not be held at your home, they should be stored in a high-yield savings account of your choice.”McCarty framed it more in terms of a ratio: “In terms of amount, don’t let your cash exceed 10% of your overall emergency fund and/or $10,000. You can’t deposit more than $10,000 in cash in a given year without raising red flags with the IRS.”Take Our Poll: Are You in Favor of More Inflation Relief in 2023?Enough for Emergency ExpensesYasmin Purnell, a personal finance expert and founder of The Wallet Moth, a finance website, suggested you keep enough cash on hand in case of an emergency that would require you to access “temporary accommodation, food and drink, gasoline, and medication.” Purnell added, “As a general rule of thumb, having access to $1,000 in cash at home would ensure you can at least pay for immediate expenses in the case of a national emergency.”Story continuesTed Capwell, an investment manager and co-founder of Safe Trade Binary Options, a financial news website, suggests that instead of keeping cash for this kind of emergency, you could keep staples. “For example, instead of keeping $500 for food, buy frozen food and store them in a refrigerator. Or buy an emergency kit instead of keeping money for hospital bills.”“You don’t need to stash hundreds of thousands of dollars because that’s just over-preparing for a catastrophe that has a really low chance of taking place,” Capwell said.Less Than $1,000Jesse Cramer, founder of The Best Interest and relationship manager at Cobblestone Capital Advisors, believes less than $1,000 is ideal.“It depends person to person, but an amount less than $1,000 is almost always preferred. There simply isn’t enough good reason to keep large amounts of liquid cash lying around the house. Banks are infinitely safer.”To drive home this point, he shared that neighbors of his parents wound up badly burned in a house fire because they were trying to find their hidden stockpiles of cash.“This is an extreme example, but the point stands,” Cramer said. “In today’s world of ubiquitous credit cards, Apple pay, Paypal, Venmo, etc., there aren’t enough good reasons to keep large amounts of cash in the house.”Keep Your Cash SafeNo matter how much cash you keep at home, you’ll want to keep it safe, said Matthew Dailly, managing director at Tiger Financial. “To begin with, you’ll need to locate safe havens for it…The loss of a large amount of cash can happen in a matter of seconds if your home is damaged by a flood or fire. Fireproof safe storage is, therefore, a good idea. In addition, you’ll serve as a lure for would-be burglars…Even if you purchase a high-tech safe, a criminal may still attempt to break into your home.”For security purposes, this money should be kept in a bolted down safe with any other valuables in the home, McCarty said. “Make sure the safe is fire and waterproof to avoid any damage. Make sure you deposit and replace the money on occasion so that the bills don’t get too old.”Jay Zigmont, PhD, CFP®, founder of Childfree Wealth, a life and financial planning firm based in Mississippi, offers another word of caution: “Having money on hand, of course comes with the threat of theft or loss, but also, it may be a challenge for you to not spend it. I’ve heard of people freezing the money–literally–to slow them down, giving their spouse or child the key to the safe or other things to slow themselves down. Figure out a balance that works for you.”Don’t PanicWhen things get bad, people have a tendency to panic, and taking out a lot of cash to protect against emergencies can actually work against you. Contrary to popular belief, you are already protected from a bank failure, Dailly said.If a bank goes under, the standard FDIC insurance is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account. “To avoid a total collapse of the entire financial system at once, you can simply divide your fortune among several banks.”Cash Loses ValueA good rule of thumb is to keep as little as you think is necessary; while it might seem weird, cash actually loses value over time. “Unlike money in circulation, which loses value over time, money in a bank retains its worth and, on occasion, even climbs in value. A safe financial institution is the only way to ensure the safety of your money,” Dailly said.More From GOBankingRates7 Florida Cities That Could Be Headed For a Housing CrisisExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 20238 Steps To Improve Your Finances in One YearThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Cash To Have Stashed at Home at All Times]"

According to PayPal-based Happy Returns’ second annual consumer report, “Returns Happen,” most consumers avoid mail-in returns whenever possible — and over 40% of those polled stated that they would rather sit in rush-hour traffic than make a mail return.See: Best Dollar Tree Items To Stock Up On for ThanksgivingFind: Costco Black Friday Deals You Shouldn’t Pass UpAfter surveying 2,002 U.S. consumers who returned an online purchase within the past year, those under 45 — and high-volume shoppers — found mail returns the most annoying. Such returns require shoppers to pack the item, print out a label and return the item by mail. The survey also found that only one-third of young shoppers have access to a printer for printing return labels.Approximately 87% of consumers also stated that free returns are an important factor when purchasing items online, including immediate refunds and no packaging. A full 96% percent stated they would even travel for a free return.The good news? The report shows that shoppers’ favorite way to return items — which are in-person, box-free returns — just so happens to be the lowest cost option.Business Insider reported that some retailers have started charging consumers a fee to ship back their returns. Rising shipping expenses and the labor involved are costing retailers millions per year.According to PayPal, shoppers often “bracket” their purchases, which means they buy multiple items with the intention of returning some of them. Data from the National Retail Federation shows that the average retailer sees $166 million in returns for every $1 billion in sales, Insider reported, and one estimate found that it costs a company 66% of the price of a product to process a return.Take Our Poll: What’s the First Thing You Would Do If You Won a Big Lottery Jackpot?More: 9 Bills You Should Never Put on AutopayPaypal’s Happy Returns gives online shoppers the opportunity to return or exchange items in-person (without printing labels or including original packaging) while receiving funds immediately.

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine International Business Machines’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines Is International Business Machines Still Cheap?Great news for investors – International Business Machines is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $202.23, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Another thing to keep in mind is that International Business Machines’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of International Business Machines look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. International Business Machines' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since IBM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IBM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IBM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing International Business Machines at this point in time.

Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said he sees technology spending continuing to grow despite fears over rising interest rates, inflation and labor constraints.Most Read from BloombergSwedish Housing Is Now in the Worst Rout Since the 1990sDisney Shares Jump on Optimism Over Iger’s Surprise ReturnBeyond Meat Plant’s Dirty Conditions Revealed in Photos, DocumentsCrypto Brokerage Genesis Is Said to Warn of Bankruptcy Without FundingUS Stocks Drop With Fed Policy, China in Focus: Markets WrapUnless there’s a “catastrophic recession,” corporate spending on technology should continue to increase, Krishna said Thursday during an event hosted by the Economic Club of New York. “As I talk to CEOs and CIOs across the globe, almost none of them are talking about cutting down technology spending,” Krishna said, adding that one point of caution is whether western Europe goes through a “major energy crisis.”Under Krishna, IBM has bet on cloud computing and artificial intelligence for growth and made 25 acquisitions since April 2020. Its stock has been a relative safe haven in the tech market meltdown, rallying 8.1% this year through Wednesday’s close compared with a 28% dip in the Nasdaq 100 index. In the most recent earnings report, IBM beat sales estimates and affirmed its cash flow forecast.Meanwhile, tech giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. began cutting thousands of jobs this month. Krishna said IBM hasn’t frozen hiring, though is adding workers at a more moderate pace than last year, focused on which regions are growing. The Armonk, New York-based company had more than 280,000 workers globally as of the end of 2021.The company likely won’t institute a return-to-office mandate as long as attendance keeps growing, Krishna said. US workers are coming into the office nearly 50% of the time, though Krishna said he’d like to see it hit 60%.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $20.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Molson Coors shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Molson Coors is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Beverages - Alcohol industry that ranks in the Top 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.04 per share to $1.07 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Molson Coors right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

GM raised the bottom end and lowered the top end of its 2022 adjusted EBIT to $13.5 billion to 14.5 billion, compared to its previous guidance of a range of $13 billion to $15 billion.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 17: A GM company banner is seen displayed at the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on November 17, 2022 in New York City. Stocks are expected to fall as the stock market opened with interest rates rising as Federal Reserve officials signal more interest rate hikes to continue to slow down inflation. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Looking head to 2023 – 2025, GM now expects revenue to grow at a 12% compound annual rate through 2025, reaching more than $225 billion as EV volumes and software revenue grow. The company expects revenue from EVs to be more than $50 billion in 2025.As for its EV game plan, the automaker says its EV portfolio will be “solidly profitable in 2025” in North America, as the company scales EV capacity to more than 1 million units annually. GM seeing the EV business as profitable by 2025 is years ahead of schedule, when it originally expected margins for EVs to be comparable to gas-powered cars by 2030.The company is citing the effect of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and its incentives to build EVs and batteries in North America.“It’s clear these credits are going to help usher in a new era of technology innovation and job creation that’s going to achieve what was intended,” GM CEO Mary Barra said during a presentation at the company's investor day in New York. “It will be good for the American economy. It’ll be good for American families. It’ll be good for the environment, and frankly, General Motors is well poised.”But GM's profit boost isn't all the result of the IRA. The company is also improving operationally to boost profitability in the near term and fund EV initiatives for the future.""We've retooled our ICE portfolio, to fund the transition to an all-electric in the future in the out years,"" GM President Mark Reuss told Yahoo Finance from GM's investor day. Reuss noted changes to its pickup truck business, where GM is number one with its Silverado and Sierra sales combined and with its SUV offerings such as the Terrain and Equinox helping the bottom line. GM is also launching production of its updated mid-size pickup trucks, which is a growing segment, at its Wentzville, Missouri, plant.Story continuesMichael Simcoe, General Motors VP of Global Design and Lenny Kravitz introduce the Cadillac Celestiq electric-sedan during its unveiling in Los Angeles, California on October 17, 2022. - The ultra-luxury low-volume Celestiq features a host of 3D-printed parts for extensive customization and is the second EV in Cadillac's lineup. (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP) (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)GM is also changing the way customers will order cars, with a new streamlined process in which customers will eventually purchase them online, with GM providing delivery through its own distribution network. Reuss says the new ""buy your way"" strategy will save GM around $2,000 for every vehicle sold.GM is also innovating on how it plans to make next generation of vehicles. Take the $300,000 Cadillac CELESTIQ for example. It is essentially a handmade car, using bespoke parts, with Cadillac designers working hand in hand with clients to make these one-off cars. At low volume it would be very expensive to make, but Cadillac is implementing new production techniques, like the use of additive manufacturing, which is similar to 3D-printing.""We've installed a complete additive manufacturing facility with lots of machines, whether its metallic or non-metallic, at our tech center in Warren,"" Reuss said. Even custom requests, like fusing a client's flowers into laminates for the car's interior panels or guitar strings in the center console for musician Lenny Kravitz's CELASTIQ, are possible.""A lot of that is enabled by the true bespoke nature of additive manufacturing, and as an engineer that's incredible exciting for me,"" Reuss said.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Another Latin American carrier Copa Holdings CPA delivered better-than-expected earnings per share in the third quarter, riding on the upbeat air-travel demand scenario. More earnings-related news is available in the past week’s write-up.Coming back to this week’s write-up, United Airlines UAL expects to make the most of the buoyant air-travel demand scenario this Thanksgiving travel period. Anticipating high passenger volume, UAL expects to transport 12% more passengers from the 2021 levels during the Thanksgiving travel period. An expansion-related update from JetBlue Airways JBLU was also available in the past week.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1.Azul incurred a loss (excluding $1.52 from non-recurring items) of 72 cents per share in the third quarter of 2022, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 68 cents. Loss per share, however, narrowed year over year. Total revenues of $835.6 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $849 million but increased 60.7% year over year as air-travel demand improved. With more people preferring air-travel, Azul’s passenger revenues, contributing 93.1% to the top line, surged 69.7% year over year. Cargo and other revenues declined 4.7% year over year due to a reduction in international cargo capacity.Cost per ASK (CASK) increased 28.8% from the third-quarter 2021 reported figure to 38.39 cents, mainly due to higher jet fuel prices. Fuel cost per liter increased 85.3% from the third-quarter 2021 level. CASK excluding fuel inched up 1.9% to 20.02 cents. Average fare surged 49.3% from the third-quarter 2021 figure. Azul exited the third quarter of 2022 with a total passenger operating fleet of 168 aircraft.2. Copa Holdings reported third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 2 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.91 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.63. In the year-ago quarter, CPA had reported earnings of 70 cents per share due to coronavirus-led suppressed air-travel demand at that time. Quarterly revenues of $809.4 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $816.2 million but surged 81.9% year over year, courtesy of the skyrocketed air-travel demand.Story continuesCopa Holdings, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects the fourth-quarter operating margin to be 22%. CPA expects capacity to be 6.5 billion, reflecting a 6% increase from the fourth-quarter 2019 capacity. Load factor is estimated to be around 88% in the December quarter. Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be around 6 cents. Fuel price is estimated to be $3.75 per gallon. For 2023, CPA expects capacity to increase 15% from the anticipated current-year mark.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. United Airlines reportedly anticipates transporting 5.5 million passengers during the Thanksgiving travel period. The projected passenger volume is roughly the same as the 2019 actuals (pre-coronavirus era). To meet this expected demand swell, UAL intends to operate 3,700 plus flights (on average) daily during the Nov 18-30 time frame. UAL believes that passenger volume will be the maximum on Nov 27 (the Sunday after Thanksgiving) since the start of the pandemic. More than 460,000 passengers are expected to travel on UAL flights that day. United Airlines will operate roughly 275 extra flights on the said date to meet the anticipated demand upsurge.4. To expand its footprint in Europe, JetBlue intends to launch flights to Paris next summer. Paris will be the second transatlantic destination after London for JetBlue. JBLU started operating flights on the New York-London route in August 2021. JBLU believes that its operations on the transatlantic routes, dominated by large carriers, will help slash ticket prices by intensifying competition.Expressing delight at JBLU’s impending flight services to Paris, the most visited city across Continental Europe, chief executive officer Robin Hayes said, “JetBlue is offering something completely unique to what you get from the big global legacy airlines on these routes – where a single high-fare joint venture operates nearly three-quarters of the flying. The response to our London service is proof that combining great service with low fares works.”JBLU also has plans to start flights from Boston to Paris. With the Rugby world cup slated to be held in France next year apart from the 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games scheduled to be hosted by Paris, JBLU’s decision to add flights to the city sounds prudent. The routes are likely to invite significant traffic, in turn bolstering JBLU’s top line.5. To cater to the surge in air-travel demand, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT decided to introduce routes to Nashville early next year. ALGT intends to commence operating flights to Nashville from Provo, UT on Feb 15. One-way fare for travel on the route is as low as $59. Flights to Nashville from Akron, OH will also be operational on Feb 15. One-way fare for travel on this route is kept as low as $37. To avail this low fare, tickets have to be purchased by Nov 17, 2022, for travel by Aug 13, 2023.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that even though almost all the airline stocks have traded in the red over the five trading days, the losses were muted in nature.

Shares have added about 10.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is United due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Earnings Beat in Q3United Airlines’ third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 5 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.81 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 and our estimate of $2.17. In the year-ago quarter, UAL incurred a loss of $1.02 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. The third quarter of 2022 was the second consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $12,877 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,709.5 million and our estimates of $12, 631.6 million. UAL’s revenues increased more than 66% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand. The optimistic air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 13.2% from third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels.The massive year-over-year increase in the top line was driven by more than a 75% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 90.5% of the top line) to $11,653 million. Moreover, passenger revenues increased 11.2% from the third-quarter 2019 reading. Nearly 39 million passengers traveled on UAL flights in the September quarter. This implied that passenger volume was 90% of the pre-pandemic volume. Cargo revenues skyrocketed 76.6% from third-quarter 2019 actuals to $498 million. Revenues from other sources increased 17.7% from the third-quarter 2019 tally to $726 million.Management believes that air-travel demand and pricing trends will remain strong in the December quarter as well. UAL expects adjusted operating margin in the December quarter to be around 10%, rising above the 2019 levels (pre-coronavirus) for the first time.

(NYSE:PNC) stock at an average sell price of US$187 over the last year, insiders seemed to have made the most of their holdings. The company's market valuation decreased by US$2.0b after the stock price dropped 3.1% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PNC Financial Services GroupThe Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$159. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In total, PNC Financial Services Group insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).PNC Financial Services Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of PNC Financial Services Group shares. Specifically, Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking Michael Lyons ditched US$584k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. PNC Financial Services Group insiders own about US$218m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PNC Financial Services Group Insiders?An insider hasn't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since PNC Financial Services Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

The credit commitment from PNC Bank will help provide financing for the project through the end of the five-year pledge collection period.""PNC's commitment to the communities we serve comes to life in several ways, including through our delivery of innovative ideas and creative financing solutions to help community organizations, such as Nashville Rescue Mission, grow and scale their facilities and operations,"" said Mike Johnson, PNC regional president for Tennessee.

The campus will add 166 beds and 12 family rooms to the accommodations afforded by the previous building, while increasing the capacity of the kitchen, cafeteria, chapel, classrooms, offices, meeting spaces and restrooms. The facility also will feature such enhancements as increased security and parking, as well as an expanded outdoor play area for children of various ages.""With the increasing numbers of women - especially those with young children - experiencing homelessness and seeking assistance at Nashville Rescue Mission, we determined that a more extensive and efficient facility was necessary to meet the needs of our community,"" said Rev.

Walmart (WMT) Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-buy-earnings-target-tgt-001612262.html,1668730572,STORY,"['TGT', 'WMT']","[Shares of Target TGT dropped 13% Wednesday after the company was unable to beat expectations like Walmart WMT did the day before. Earnings from the two big retailers showed different pictures of how the challenging economic environment is affecting the two companies. Target’s dismal report highlighted a common narrative on the overall behavior of consumer spending.Target and Walmart’s Q3 reports support the narrative that consumers are cutting back on spending and seeking savings. Target CEO Brian Cornell said that shopping behavior later in the quarter was impacted by inflation, rising interest rates, and economic uncertainty.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 &amp; Consumer Spending Target is widely considered among consumers shopping for mid-level to quality and premium goods across a wide range of consumer products. Target relies more on larger ticket/discretionary spending than Walmart, with TGT's emphasis on higher-end home décor, food, clothing, and electronics. Some of the higher-end products come through Target’s partnerships with Apple AAPL, Disney DIS, Levi’s LEVI, and Ulta Beauty ULTA.  Target stores also cater to their audience with premium amenities, including in-shop Starbucks SBUX at many locations. Common and popular consumer household products, food, and groceries are sold in both retail chains. However, Walmart seeks to provide products that can meet price guarantees, unlike many premium retail items and brands.Walmart’s beat on both its top and bottom line during Q3 is a clear and somewhat expected indication that consumer demand is higher for Walmart’s lower price offerings. WMT beat EPS expectations by 13% at $1.50 and 3% on the top line, with sales at $152.81 billion up 8.7% YoY.Target’s miss on its bottom line points to middle-class and higher-paying customers fading and looking for cheaper savings. TGT missed EPS expectations by 28% at $1.54 per share but revenue slightly topped expectations at 26.51 billion. This is an indication that the operating environment is tougher on Target in addition to not getting a push from its customer base.Story continuesEven though Target’s decisive inventory actions taken earlier in the year have the company more prepared for this holiday season, manament anticipates a single-digit sales decline. Walmart also said it improved on inventory levels during Q3 but is cautious of the holiday season as well.Growth &amp; Outlook For TGT’s current fiscal year, earnings are now forecasted to drop -40% at $8.07 per share, with sales up 3% to $109.77 billion. Earnings are expected to stabilize and climb 49% in FY24 at $12.01 per share. Top line growth is also expected with FY24 sales projected to be up 3% to $113.78 billion.Turning to WMT’s current fiscal year, earnings are projected to decline -7% at $5.99 per share, with sales up 5% to $605.08 billion. FY24 earnings are expected to rise 8% with sales up 3% at $623.83 billion.Over the last five years, TGT has grown at a 23% growth rate. This outpaces WMT’s 8% and the S&amp;P 500’s 13% growth rate.Performance &amp; Valuation Over the last year, Walmart shares have acted somewhat defensive and recouped losses from earlier in the year. After their Q3 reports, WMT is now up +2% YTD to outperform TGT’s -29% and the benchmark. However, over the last decade, TGT’s total return has still beaten WMT.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter the large drop following its Q3 release, TGT trades at a 19.2X forward earnings multiple and further below its decade-high of 26.8X. In comparison, WMT now trades at a 25.4X forward earnings multiple, solidly below its decade-high of 28.1X.From a valuation standpoint, Target continues to look more attractive relative to Walmart and this would be expected after Wednesday’s decline. However, Target’s expected return to growth in its FY24 is even more critical as the company expects sales to be slightly down in Q4.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividends Both stocks have strong dividends, having increased them in each of the last five years. However, the TGT dividend trumps WMT. TGT offers investors a 2.78% annual dividend yield at $4.32 per share, which is considerably higher than WMT’s 1.51% at $2.24 per share.WMT’s annual dividend yield is on par with its Retail Supermarkets Industry average of 1.62% but TGT’s dividend is above its Retail-Discount Stores Industry average of 1.04%.Bottom LineBoth TGT and WMT still land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The two omnichannel retailers have an important significance to American society, making them solid long-term investments despite economic uncertainty. The innovation of both companies still rectifies this with Target’s one-stop in-shop approach and Walmart’s push into healthcare.Considering which stock to add to the portfolio still centers around investors’ risk tolerance and time horizon. Short term, WMT stock may continue to be less volatile than TGT and this has been especially true over the last year. However, TGT’s growth and dividend have trumped WMT and Target remains more attractive from a valuation standpoint. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We've been talking a lot about retail. The stock up just about 3% today, after falling 13% yesterday. The driver today is an upgrade from Piper Sandler. They're more bullish on the retailer, saying that it is a compelling play, citing inventory improvements.Analyst Edward Yruma writing, quote, ""Target is rapidly shifting inventory composition away from discretionary categories as the consumer continues to shift away from those key categories."" He also thinks that as Target pulls back on some of its promotional activity as we look ahead to 2023, that it will be able to regain 50% of its gross margin compression.Piper Sandler now has an overweight rating on the retailer-- $200 price target, 40 bucks higher from where it is today. And, Jared, a very different tune than what we heard yesterday, when so many on the street seem to be dumping the stock because of the results that we got.- Yes, yesterday was not a very good day. Let's go to the YFi Interactive where we can see. This is actually a year-to-date chart. So there's a huge gap, if you can see that at the hard-right edge of your screen. But it's been consolidating. And the stock has been consolidating for about six months, there.And let's take a look at a three-year chart. And you can see, like so many other stocks over the pandemic, it has really retraced quite a bit of those gains, and really just consolidating.

However, it missed our estimate for total revenues by 3.2%.Segment DetailsInstruments &amp; AccessoriesRevenues at the segment totaled $871.6 million, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 15.4%. This can be attributed to 20% da Vinci procedure volume growth. This was partially offset by foreign currency impacts.

Moreover, procedure volume showed a recovery from the impact of COVID-related lockdowns in China, boosting the ex-U.S. growth rate.SystemsIn the reported quarter, System revenues gained 2.6% year over year to $425.9 million.

213,8d2826a0-9b88-3815-98af-7ef2fba597be,ISRG,2022-11-18,Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) May Have Issues Allocating Its Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-nasdaq-isrg-may-140205975.html,1668693725.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Intuitive Surgical:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 14%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceIn the above chart we have measured Intuitive Surgical's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Intuitive Surgical doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 20%, but since then they've fallen to 14%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Story continuesOur Take On Intuitive Surgical's ROCEIn summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Intuitive Surgical is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. Furthermore the stock has climbed 99% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.Intuitive Surgical could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation  on our platform quite valuable.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-intuitive-133001798.html,1668691801.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ISRG for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Intuitive Surgical, Inc.'s Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Intuitive Surgical, Inc.'s main business drivers.Headquartered Sunnyvale, CA, Intuitive Surgical Inc designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system and related instruments and accessories, which is an advanced robot-assisted surgical system. The surgical system comprises a surgeon’s console, patient-side cart, 3-D vision system, da Vinci Skills Simulator and Firefly Fluorescence Imaging.Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology which has provided the company with a solid exposure to Mechatronics, Robotocs and Artificial Intelligence for healthcare. The system provides 3-D High Definition vision, which helps surgeons gain superior visual clarity of target tissue and anatomy.It also manufactures EndoWrist instruments, such as forceps, scissors, electrocautery tools, scalpels, and other surgical tools, which incorporate wrist joints for natural dexterity for various surgical procedures.  Additionally, the company sells various accessories comprising sterile drapes for ensuring sterile field during surgery; and vision products that include replacement 3D stereo endoscopes, camera heads, light guides, and other items that facilitate use of the da Vinci Surgical System, as well as Ion endoluminal system for biopsies.Story continuesThe company operates through three segments: Instruments and Accessories, Systems and Services.2021 Results at a GlanceIntuitive Surgical’s 2021 revenues totaled $5.71 billion, up 31% from 2020.The company’s Instruments &amp; Accessories sales were $3.10 billion (54.3% of net revenues), Systems revenues were $1.69 billion (29.7%) and Services revenues grossed $916.2 million (16%).Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $4,433.96, or a gain of 343.40%, as of November 17, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 191.11% and the price of gold increased -0.46% over the same time frame in comparison.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for ISRG.Intuitive Surgical reported robust third-quarter results, beating estimates on both counts. The company’s da Vinci procedure volume demonstrated strong recovery in the first nine months of 2022, a trend likely to continue in upcoming quarter. The company’s revenue growth in the quarter under review reflected rise in revenues from procedures, system placements and services across all markets. Per management, strong U.S. dollar, lingering supply chain issues and inflation hurt operating margin. Despite this challenging environment, Intuitive Surgical witnessed healthy customer demand for its products in the quarter under review. A stable liquidity position is an added plus. It outperformed its industry so far this year. Yet, stiff competition in the global MedTech space and rising costs remain concerns for Intuitive Surgical.The stock is up 24.58% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

We have five stocks for you-- Gap, Applied Materials, Ross Stores, Palo Alto Networks, and Williams-Sonoma. So let's get to it. Gap shares up just around 6 and 1/2% after hours, a very strong report here from the retailer. Beat on both the top and bottom lines. Comp sales for total Gap sales up just about 1%. The estimate was for a decline of 3%. You're looking at gains after hours. And really, Wall Street discounting the fact that Gap warned that holiday sales might not be as strong as they initially had expected. Over the last three months, we're looking at gains of just about 15%.Taking a look at Applied Materials, that stock up just about 3% in extended trading. EPS and sales beating the Street's forecast as well as a strong guidance here from the company. A couple of comments coming out from executives saying that their backlog is still increasing. They also expect the overall chip market to reach a trillion dollars by 2030. We're looking at losses of just about 1 and 1/2%, essentially flat over the last three months. Year-to-date, we're off still just about 33%.Taking a look at Ross Stores next up, that stock up just about 12% after hours. It's actually fared relatively well amid this downturn that we're seeing in the economy. Over the last three months, the stock up just around 5 and 1/2%. Third quarter EPS beat strong fourth quarter guidance. CEO Barbara Rentler warning, though, on consumer spending, something that we have certainly heard from other retailers so far this earnings season. She said that, quote, ""expect a very promotional holiday selling season, also ongoing inflationary headwinds, to pressure our low to moderate income customers."" Again, year-to-date, though, the stock is still in the red, off just about 14%.Moving on to Palo Alto Networks, that stock up nearly 5% in after-hours trading. Second quarter adjusted EPS topping what the Street was expecting in terms of the guidance here from the company. They now expect to see $0.76 to $0.78 per share. Full-year profit outlook also very strong. Fiscal first quarter earnings did beat on both the top and bottom lines. We're looking at losses so far this year, up just about 15%.And wrapping it up with Williams-Sonoma, that stock under a significant amount of pressure. Although, it was off just over 10% a couple of minutes ago. Now we're looking at losses of just about 8%. They missed on EPS. Revenue, though, did come in slightly better than what the Street was looking for. The company, though, not reiterating or updating its guidance through fiscal year 2024, citing macro uncertainty. That's the big driver in shares after hours. Over the past three months, the stock has been under pressure, off just about 21%. Year-to-date, we're looking at losses at pretty much the same, off just about 23%. Rachelle?]"

By working together, Regions, CDFIs and MDIs are expanding no-cost access to financial services through the Regions ATM network. Specifically, the agreement covers customers of the following institutions:Carver State Bank, a CDFI and MDI in Savannah, GeorgiaCitizens Savings Bank &amp; Trust, a CDFI and MDI in Nashville, TennesseeCommonwealth National Bank, a CDFI and MDI in Mobile, AlabamaFriend Bank, a CDFI in Dothan, AlabamaHope Community Credit Union, a CDFI in Jackson, MississippiOptus Bank, a CDFI and MDI in Columbia, South CarolinaSouthern Bancorp, a CDFI in Arkadelphia, Arkansas""Regions Bank is committed to creating more inclusive prosperity, and this collaboration is a key component of our broader, long-term work with CDFIs and MDIs to expand access to essential financial services,"" said John Turner, President and CEO of Regions Financial Corp. ""This new collaboration will benefit individual consumers in several states. Regions Bank and the Regions Community Development Corporation have also worked closely with CDFIs and MDIs in the past to support business activity in underserved communities, including a series of equity investments.

""Our institution serves communities in the Mid-South that may not have convenient ways to make withdrawals or even check their balances. This partnership with Regions not only makes banking more accessible for our customers, but it will also help support our communities and, ultimately, our local economies.""The ATM arrangement follows a gathering hosted in June by Regions' head of Community Affairs, Leroy Abrahams, and Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for the bank. Abrahams and Boyen met with executives from CDFIs and MDIs for an information-sharing session and to brainstorm ways the organizations can collaborate to better support local communities, especially underserved populations.Earlier this year, the Regions Community Development Corporation announced three equity-focused deals with CDFIs and MDIs, including two CDFIs that are included in the current ATM arrangement, Southern Bancorp and Carver Financial.""CDFIs and MDIs serve a vital role in ensuring equitable access to the financial system,"" Abrahams said.

During his tenure, a boom in financial technology companies and digital lenders fueled competition with traditional players.He also led Visa during ahigh-profile standoffwith e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc, which considered dropping Visa as a partner on its U.S. co-branded credit card.

Congress ordered the FAA to mandate them under the 2021 infrastructure law.""The black and white nutrition labels that have been on food products for decades are simple to read and easy to understand,"" FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said. ""We are borrowing the model from food products because we want to make basic information about internet service easy to understand.""Labels must be fully displayed on the main purchasing pages that providers have online and ""cannot be buried in multiple clicks or reduced to a link or icon that a consumer might miss,"" Rosenworcel added.The $1 trillion 2021 infrastructure bill includes $65 billion to boost internet access. There is a separate $10 billion COVID-19 aid program administered by the U.S. Treasury that also aims to boost broadband internet access in underserved communities.It also includes $42.45 billion in grants for states and territories for broadband infrastructure.Authors of the infrastructure law said last year 19 million Americans lack access to high-speed internet. The law includes $14.2 billion for FCC vouchers for low-income families to use toward internet service plans.

And what are the kindest acts you can do for your neighbors? Verizon teamed up with Nextdoor and commissioned a new academic study with Kindness.org to expand on research completed last year to see how kindness in America has changed and investigate the ways in which kindness impacts neighborhoods.The results? Americans are very kind to their neighbors and appreciative of their impact on their lives. They had a ‘kindness quotient’ of 86% – which means that they care about their neighbors 86% as much as they care about themselves. (And they reported that their neighbors had a kindness quotient of 72% to them.) For example:94% of people say they would return a lost item to a neighbor61% of people say they would forgive the debt of a neighbor41% of people say they would adopt the child of a neighbor who passed awayThe average American would give up $7.60 if that meant a neighbor got $10.Further, when asked what emotion or feeling they associate with their neighbors, respondents' top scoring selections were ‘happy’ (63%) and ‘grateful’ (61%).The research also found that kindness from neighbors was the best predictor of: individual happiness, satisfaction with one's neighborhood, identification with one’s neighbors, and sense of inclusion with one’s neighborhood.“We asked 10,000 people, from all 50 states, which kind acts they would do for their neighbors,” said Dr. Oliver Scott Curry, Chief Science Officer for Kindness.org. “Overall, our research revealed a surprisingly high capacity for kindness across America. And it shows that kindness is an important part of building better communities.”All 50 states were very kind, and very similar, but the state with the kindest neighbors overall was Georgia, which made it to the top of the new leaderboard. The top 10 states with the kindest neighbors are:Story continues1. Georgia 2. Tennessee 3. North Carolina 4. Arkansas 5. Utah6. Louisiana 7. West Virginia 8. Mississippi 9. Texas 10. NebraskaIn September, Verizon and Nextdoor celebrated National Neighbor Day with the release of a study that identified the most impactful acts of kindness you can do for your neighbors. They included:Top 10 Overall Kindest Acts for NeighborsPay for a neighbor’s groceries at the supermarketDonate money to a neighborDonate diapers to a neighborBuy extra school supplies for a neighborRemind a neighbor that they matterAccept a neighbor as they areOrganize or join local park and beach clean upsTell a neighbor what a positive difference they made to someone else’s lifeMow the lawn for a neighborSurprise a neighbor with their favorite things“The results of this research remind us that a simple act of kindness needn’t cost much but can make a huge impact on someone, whether you are at home, at work or in your neighborhood,” said Krista Bourne, chief operating officer of Verizon Consumer Group. “Our #ACallForKindness campaign provides the resources that everyone can use to help make the world a kinder place.”“From neighbors rallying for one another during Hurricane Ian, to moments of celebration shared through posts and photos, we see the findings of this study brought to life every day,” said Sarah Friar, Chief Executive Officer, Nextdoor. “These results bring to light the profound impact we can bring to our neighbors’ lives, as well as our own, through the strength of simple kind acts.”“We are thrilled to partner with leading companies like Nextdoor and Verizon who are betting big on kindness and working to help communities thrive,” said Jaclyn Lindsey, co-founder and CEO for kindness.org. “This research validates the work being done and shows how we can have an even greater impact in building a kinder world.”Verizon’s #ACallForKindness campaign inspires kind acts through a multifaceted approach that leverages research, inspires people through art, educates people through kindness experts, and provides opportunities for people to quickly and easily choose kindness, no matter who they are or where they live.

248,40bf0f0a-daa9-39a1-a5de-c1c9d9f4ced0,NVDA,2022-11-18,Analyzing NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock After Q3 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyzing-nvidia-nvda-stock-q3-012601755.html,1668734761,STORY,['NVDA'],"[NVIDIA’s NVDA Q3 earnings were much anticipated as one of the 10 largest components of the Nasdaq 100. The stock also tends to have big movements after reporting. On the contrary, NVIDIA’s movement following yesterday’s report has been subtle. Let’s take a look at what’s going on with NVDA stock post-earnings.Q3 Results Investor sentiment toward semiconductors stocks has been low this year as consumers strayed away from technology products during a high inflationary environment. Better than expected CPI numbers last week and Q3 earnings mostly in line with estimates from AMD earlier in the month had given NVDA stock a boost before its release. NVDIA’s dominance as a worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit (GPU) made its Q3 results and guidance significant to the broader outlook for chip demand.In its Q3 results, NVDA missed earnings expectations by -17% with EPS of $0.58. This represented a -72% decline from Q3 2021 but up 4% from the previous quarter. The company was able to slightly beat top line expectations with sales of $5.93 billion. This was down -17% from a year ago and -12% from the previous quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchData Center, NVDA’s largest segment that offers accelerated computing solutions saw its revenue jump 31% from a year ago at $3.83 billion. However, revenue from NVIDIA’s gaming segment was down -51% at $1.57 billion. Gaming unit setbacks and an inventory charge due to low demand for data center chips in China forced its gross margins lower.Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said the company is adapting to the macro environment, correcting inventory levels, and paving way for new products. This appeared to calm investors’ nerves and prevent a big selloff after NVDA posted its second straight earnings miss. NVDA had previously beaten expectations for 14 consecutive quarters.  The company gave guidance for Q4 sales at $6 billion, plus or minus 2%, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate at $6.23 billion. NVDA shares fell 1.4% Thursday following its after-hours report yesterday.Story continuesOutlookYear over year, NVDA earnings are now expected to decline -23% in its current fiscal 2023 at $3.39 per share. FY24 earnings are projected to stabilize and jump 31% to $4.45 a share. Earnings estimates are trending down this week after the Q3 report.Sales are now expected to be virtually flat in fiscal 2023 and rise 13% in FY24 to $30.64 billion. This has the company in line to almost triple its 2020 revenue of $10.9 billion. However, sales estimates have started to decline following the report as well.Performance &amp; Valuation                NVDA is now down -46% YTD to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -18% and the Nasdaq’s -29%. Over the last decade, NVDA’s total return is still an astonishing +5,593% to crush the benchmark and the broader technology sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFollowing its Q3 report, NVDA trades at 64.8X earnings. NVDA still trades at a discount to its decade-high of 93.5X but above the median of 37.1X. Wall Street’s willingness to pay a premium for NVDA may also begin to waver after consecutive bottom-line misses.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineNVDA currently lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), in correlation with declining earnings estimate revisions after Q3 earnings. Missing EPS expectations for consecutive quarters along with underwhelming guidance may also weigh on the near-term performance of the stock.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NUVA delivered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 54 cents for third-quarter 2022, up 68.8% year over year. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.9%.The one-time adjustments include expenses associated with certain business transition costs and European medical device regulation, among others.GAAP loss per share of 4 cents compared favorably with the year-ago loss of 42 cents.Total RevenuesRevenues in the third quarter totaled $295.3 million, up 9% year over year on a reported basis and 12.9% at a constant exchange rate or CER.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNuVasive, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NuVasive, Inc. QuoteThird-quarter revenue growth was driven by continued positive momentum from the adoption of new products, higher procedural volumes in the United States and strong international performance.Geographical &amp; Segmental DetailsIn the reported quarter, U.S. Spinal Hardware business revenues rose 12.7% year over year to $163.5 million on continued growth in the Simplify Cervical Disc and C360 portfolios.Revenues from the U.S. Surgical Support business were $63 million in the third quarter, up 4.2% year over year. Growth was partially offset by a decline in Biologics, which was due to fewer stocking orders as well as shifts in procedure volume toward cervical cases.International net sales for the third quarter were $68.8 million, representing growth of 5.3% year over year (up 21.3% at CER).Margin DetailsIn the reported quarter, gross profit rose 17.7% year over year to $214.7 million. The gross margin expanded 534 basis points (bps) to 72.6%.Selling, general and administrative expenses climbed 5.4% year over year to $154 million, whereas research and development (R&amp;D) expenses rose 1.1% year over year to $23.7 million.Overall adjusted operating profit was $36.7 million, a huge improvement from the year-ago figure of $12.7 million. Adjusted operating margin saw a 774-bp expansion year over year to 12.4%.Story continuesFinancial DetailsThe company exited the third quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $237.5 million, compared with $225.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the quarter was $122.3 million compared with the prior-year period’s $144.8 million.2022 GuidanceNuVasive has updated its guidance for full-year 2022.The company expects revenue growth in the range of 5.5-6.5% on a reported basis (down from the previous range of 6-8%) and 8.7-9.7% at CER (narrowed from the prior projection of 8.7-10.7%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.21 billion.The company expects its adjusted EPS guidance in the band of $2.00-$2.10 (down from $2.15-$2.45 expected earlier). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.09.The company has reduced its adjusted operating margin guidance to the range of 12.3%-13.0% (13.0-14.5% previously).Our TakeNuVasive exited the third quarter of 2022 with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong sales performance across the U.S. Spinal Hardware and U.S. Surgical Support businesses instill optimism. Robust international performance is encouraging. The continued demand for the Simplified Cervical Disc and the Pulse platforms is also encouraging. The expansion of both margins is an upside.However, revenue for the quarter under review missed the consensus mark. The company’s performance continues to be challenged by inflationary costs, supply chain disruptions, volatility in foreign exchange rates and the persistent COVID-led impact. The reduced 2022 guidance signals the continuation of this gloomy scenario.Zacks Rank and Key PicksNuVasive currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, AMN Healthcare Services AMN and McKesson MCK, all carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

MMSI is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by its strong product portfolio. A robust third-quarter 2022 performance, along with its solid international exposure, is expected to contribute further. However, headwinds related to higher consolidation in the healthcare industry and the lack of direct sales and marketing capabilities persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 12.9% against a 16.8% decline of the industry and a 18.1% decline of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned medical-devices provider has a market capitalization of $3.98 billion. The company is projected to record 11% growth over the next five years on the back of its continued strong segmental performance. It delivered an earnings surprise of 25.35% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about Merit Medical’s continued gains on the significant momentum of its new products. We are also optimistic about the company’s product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products. Last month, the company announced the launch of the SCOUT Mini Reflector, which has been designed for use in soft tissues, such as breast and lymph nodes.The company, in April, launched the ReSolve Thoracostomy Tray, which has all products needed for performing a thoracostomy.International Exposure: We are upbeat about Merit Medical’s current global operations, including its territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America, Mexico, and Canada. In the third quarter of 2022, Merit Medical confirmed that its international sales (42.7% of net sales) improved 6.1% from the corresponding period of 2021. This included increased sales of 5.7% in APAC operations, 17.4% in Rest of the World operations and 4.7% in EMEA operations, reportedly.Strong Q3 Results: Merit Medical’s robust third-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company also saw solid segmental growth and growth across all product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Solid product sales and robust performances in both the United States and outside were also witnessed. Strong execution and improving customer demand trends raised the overall top line. Expansion of the adjusted operating margin also bodes well.Story continuesRiskLack of Direct Sales and Marketing Capabilities: Merit Medical lacks direct sales and marketing capabilities in many countries. The company wholly depends on third-party distributors for the commercialization of products in countries like China, Japan, Russia and India. Per management, because of inefficiencies in the distributor base, Merit Medical often fails to successfully commercialize its products in these countries.Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

CAH recently announced the launch of a supply chain network and last-mile fulfillment solution, Velocare. The solution is capable of reaching patients in a few hours with critical products and services needed for hospital-level care at home.Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions, via a tie-up with Medically Home, will now be supporting a Medically Home health system customer with Velocare, thereby collectively enabling scaled, high-acuity care at home.The latest technology offering, launched as a pilot with Medically Home, is expected to significantly strengthen Cardinal Health’s Medical business.Significance of the LaunchPer a recent study by McKinsey &amp; Company, it is estimated that up to $265 billion worth of care services for Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries could shift to the home by 2025 without a reduction in quality or access. The research also reveals the way stakeholders — including payers, healthcare facilities and physician groups, home-based care providers, technology companies and investors — could see the substantial value of providing patients with care in the comfortable settings of their homes.Velocare is expected to bring together Cardinal Health’s capabilities via a combined offering intended for health systems and telehealth providers, among other entities that transport high-acuity care to the home. Legacy Cardinal Health’s capabilities include global logistics and distribution expertise, management of a large network of suppliers and vendors, and access to a wide range of home-based care providers. The pilot will likely test the use of new technology, new order-handling processes, small-format depots and short-haul delivery vehicles to enable safe and consistent hospital-level care at home.Patients who have been admitted to brick-and-mortar hospitals with issues like severe pneumonia and complicated urinary tract infections, among others, are now likely to receive high-quality, safe, hospital-level care at the comfort of their homes. The Velocare pilot includes real-time evaluation of the technology, service levels, effectiveness and patient experiences, besides plans for future growth in new markets.Story continuesCardinal Health’s management is upbeat about expanding its at-Home Solutions supply chain and logistics services to now reach patients receiving hospital-level care at home. Management also feels that advancing the concept of the availability of care to patients irrespective of their location with the pilot of Velocare demonstrates its ability to operate and grow within the developing hospital-at-home model.Medically Home's management believes that the ability to further scale the delivery of goods to the home will likely advance the rapidly growing hospital-at-home market, driving scale and efficiency for its high-acuity care model.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global supply chain management market is estimated to grow from $28.9 billion in 2022 to $45.2 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 9.4%. Factors like rapid growth in retail and e-commerce, and technological advancements in the supply-chain industry are expected to drive the market.Given the growing market potential, the new launch seems to have been timed well.Recent DevelopmentThis month, Cardinal Health reported its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, where it recorded solid growth in its top line. The company also affirmed its focus on the Medical Improvement Plan initiatives for the full fiscal year.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 53.7% in the past year against the industry’s 15.2% decline and the S&amp;P 500’s 17.4% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Cardinal Health carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

The optimism led by the company's solid third-quarter 2022 performance, along with growing momentum in its Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, is expected to contribute further. However, forex woes and Nutrition Product recall impeding growth are concerning.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 18.8% compared with 46.8% decline of the industry and 17.4% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned provider of a diversified line of healthcare products has a market capitalization of $180.65 billion. The company projects 5.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Abbott’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 21.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Progress With Diabetes Business: We are optimistic about Abbott’s diabetes business. This business achieved robust organic sales growth in the third quarter of 2022, led by strong growth in FreeStyle Libre. In the quarter, sales of FreeStyle Libre exceeded $1 billion. Abbott’s user base expanded to approximately 4.5 million users globally. In the United States, where sales grew more than 40%, the company initiated the full launch of Libre 3. This latest device can automatically deliver up-to-the-minute glucose readings with more accuracy in the world’s smallest and thinnest wearable sensor.EPD Business Gains Momentum: Abbott’s EPD business operates solely in emerging geographies, with leading positions in many of the largest and fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world. These markets include India, Russia, China and Latin America. The company recently noted that banking on the successful execution of its Branded Generic operating model, EPD is well-positioned for sustained growth in many of these growing pharmaceutical markets.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Abbott’s better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. Within the company’s Diagnostics business, excluding COVID testing revenues, sales growth of routine diagnostic tests in the third quarter went up globally. This was fueled by the continued global rollout of the Alinity instrument for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testing. In Medical Device, global sales growth was also strong. In the United States, sales growth was led by strong double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care.DownsidesForeign Exchange Translation Impacts Sales: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of the Euro and some other developed market currencies has been constantly hampering the company’s performance in the international markets.Nutrition Product Recall Impedes Growth: Within Abbott’s Nutrition business, in the third quarter, worldwide Nutrition sales were down on an organic basis, with a significant slump in Pediatric Nutrition sales. The downside in total worldwide Nutrition and Pediatric Nutrition sales can be attributed to a voluntary recall and manufacturing shutdown of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of Abbott's U.S. plants since last February.Estimate TrendAbbott has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 4.4% north to $5.21.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $9.47 billion, suggesting a 17.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Since the days of theatrical performances to the original box offices in New York City and now to the era of professional visualizations, global productions, and billion dollar franchises, the industry has seen it all.The global movies and entertainment market was valued at $90 billion last year according to the research firm Grand View Research and is estimated to sit at $95 billion by the end of this year. From then until 2030, the segment will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2% and be worth a whopping $170 billion by the end of the forecast period. In this multi billion dollar pie, North America was the dominating player, and according to the research firm, the region accounted for 34.5% of the overall market last year. However, particularly due to its size, the North American film market will not grow as fast as the fastest growing region which is Asia Pacific. The region will outpace the broader industry when it comes to growth, through a CAGR of 8.2%.Another report, this time from Market Data Research, focuses its attention on the motion picture industry. It estimates that this particular sector was worth $42 billion in 2019 and will grow at an 8.3% CAGR to sit at an estimated $44 billion by the end of 2027. It agrees with Grand View Research on Asia Pacific being the region with the highest growth, and highlights that the region's younger population of individuals aged under 25 years will drive move viewership. Segregating motion pictures by genre, Market Data Research reveals that Fantasy was the largest segment in 2019 and it will continue to lead in 2027 as well. In the second place, to no one's surprise, are Action movies. Additionally, the research firm outlines that Asia Pacific will have a strong growth rate of 9.5%.Story continuesDelving a bit deeper into film production, especially since newer technologies such as 3D animations and movies are disruptive, is merited as well. Fortunately for us, IndustryARC has a report that analyzed the 3D movie theater market. This market will have the strongest growth rate in our research today, with the research firm stating that it will grow at a whopping 20.1% CAGR between 2021 and 2026 to sit at an estimated $10 billion by the end of the forecast period. Coupling this with Market Data Research's value of $44 billion for motion pictures in 2027, it is safe to conclude that 3D movie theaters will account for more than a quarter of the total pie. The research firm also reports that in 2020, multiplexes held the highest market share, since they have multiple screens which allow the cinema to host a maximum number of viewers. In 2020, Asia held the largest share as it contributed 35% to the overall market, Europe controlled 23% of the market, and North America came in second place after accounting for 20% of the overall revenue pie.Today's piece will focus on the largest film production companies in the world, and the top players are The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Netflix, Inc.

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. For example, the Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) share price return of 13% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Disappointingly, the share price is down 1.4% in the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last three years, Colgate-Palmolive failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 5.1% (annualized).Earnings per share have melted like a stack of ice cubes, in stark contrast to the share price. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.It may well be that Colgate-Palmolive revenue growth rate of 4.9% over three years has convinced shareholders to believe in a brighter future. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth, and maybe shareholder's faith in better days ahead will be rewarded.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthColgate-Palmolive is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Colgate-Palmolive will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Colgate-Palmolive, it has a TSR of 21% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Colgate-Palmolive shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 0.9% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 3% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Colgate-Palmolive   you should know about.Of course Colgate-Palmolive may not be the best stock to buy.

Selling at an average price of US$44.50, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Comcast The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ComcastThe Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$397k worth of shares at a price of US$44.50 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$34.26. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Daniel Murdock was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of ComcastLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Comcast insiders own about US$1.3b worth of shares (which is 0.9% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Comcast Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Comcast shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Comcast insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Congress ordered the FAA to mandate them under the 2021 infrastructure law.""The black and white nutrition labels that have been on food products for decades are simple to read and easy to understand,"" FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said. ""We are borrowing the model from food products because we want to make basic information about internet service easy to understand.""Labels must be fully displayed on the main purchasing pages that providers have online and ""cannot be buried in multiple clicks or reduced to a link or icon that a consumer might miss,"" Rosenworcel added.The $1 trillion 2021 infrastructure bill includes $65 billion to boost internet access. There is a separate $10 billion COVID-19 aid program administered by the U.S. Treasury that also aims to boost broadband internet access in underserved communities.It also includes $42.45 billion in grants for states and territories for broadband infrastructure.Authors of the infrastructure law said last year 19 million Americans lack access to high-speed internet. The law includes $14.2 billion for FCC vouchers for low-income families to use toward internet service plans. More than 14 million households are taking part.The FCC also said Thursday it will begin a new proceeding that asks ""how to incorporate more pricing and discount data on the label itself, how to measure service reliability, and how to make broadband nutrition labels even more accessible.""

In both trends, they have intergenerational support.“Millennials are acutely attuned to the benefits of a hybrid working model,” said Prudential Financial vice chair Rob Falzon in the company's latest report, ""Generational Gap Grows: Work &amp; Money Outlook Divided."" He noted that their status as the largest generation in the workforce and their proclivity for flexibility will make hybrid work a permanent fixture.That might be a good thing for employers, considering that a majority of hybrid workers (70%) reported that they have strong feelings of company loyalty, Prudential found after surveying more than 4,700 adults. Only 64% of in-person and 59% of remote workers feel similarly faithful to their employer.Perhaps the gap is because hybrid employees are also more likely to feel satisfied by their pay and individually tailored benefits, the research finds.Since hybrid workers are often more happy with their compensation, they therefore might be less prone to job hopping, which has been an increasingly popular avenue for employees in a time when more people are struggling to make ends meet—a trend especially popular among younger generations, per Prudential.While many big employers want workers back at their desks five days a week, hybrid policies often end up being the middle ground they strike in order to appease employees who want the flexibility of remote work and the higher-ups who want workers back at their desks.Data from Work From Home Research shows that hybrid work isn’t just a blip in workforce trends. Researchers found that the benefits of hybrid work include more satisfied employees; better productivity; more diversity, equality, and inclusion support; and a possible better use of space. While remote work is a newfound desire, the study found that most employees want to work remotely at most three days a week. And most employees have taken to hybrid work so much that they value the policy’s flexibility as much as an 8% pay raise.Story continues“In 2023, we’ll be laughing at anyone who does anything else but hybrid,” Nick Bloom, Stanford economist and researcher at WFH Research, told Fortune’s Jane Thier.And previous research from software company Citrix revealed that hybrid knowledge workers were more likely than their remote or fully in-office peers to connect with their coworkers in a manner that made them happier and more productive. They also reported being more connected to their leaders.Turns out, even with a potential impending recession, hybrid work is still the popular policy for most workers. And if companies want their employees to stick around, they might want to let them out of their sight three days a week.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The Pandemic Housing Bubble is bursting—KPMG says prices falling 15% look ‘conservative’The American middle class is at the end of an eraMeet the 30-year-old who just became Europe’s wealthiest millennial after inheriting half of the Red Bull empireSam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each other]"

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, United Rentals is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Construction Partners has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that URI has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.URI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.67, while ROAD has a forward P/E of 37.98. We also note that URI has a PEG ratio of 0.59. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ROAD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.03.Another notable valuation metric for URI is its P/B ratio of 3.79. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ROAD has a P/B of 3.82.Based on these metrics and many more, URI holds a Value grade of A, while ROAD has a Value grade of C.URI stands above ROAD thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that URI is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $1.94 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 18.02%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of chipmaking equipment would post earnings of $1.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.94, delivering a surprise of 8.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Applied Materials , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, posted revenues of $6.75 billion for the quarter ended October 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.82%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Applied Materials shares have lost about 33.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -16.9%.What's Next for Applied Materials?While Applied Materials has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Applied Materials: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.91 on $6.38 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.68 on $23.74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication is currently in the bottom 18% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Oracle (ORCL), has yet to report results for the quarter ended November 2022.This software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Oracle's revenues are expected to be $12.04 billion, up 16.2% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company revealed that it would cut production of DRAM and NAND memory chips by approximately 20% compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 levels.Why Does Micron Intend to Slash Chip Output?Micron’s latest plan to reduce the memory chip supply can be seen as an effort to keep inventory levels in check amid the declining demand. The company benefited from the heightened demand for computers and other consumer technology products during the pandemic-led work-and-learn-from-home wave.However, the reopening of economies, along with recessionary fears and inflation, has been hurting demand. This has resulted in weakening the memory chip demand from the smartphone and personal computer end markets, the major contributors to Micron’s revenues.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteA decline in demand has caused an excessive inventory pileup across channel partners. Excess inventory levels are impacting the price of memory chips as these are traded like commodities. Therefore, an excess supply and lower demand will reduce the price of memory prices, thereby impacting the manufacturer’s profitability.Micron’s latest initiative will help it improve the total inventory in the supply chain and stabilize falling memory chip prices. Under its production cut strategy, the company intends to shrink the DRAM bit supply in the calendar year 2023 from 2022 while keeping NAND bit supply growth in the single-digit percentage range.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMicron currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of MU have decreased 36.8% year to date (YTD).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering from the broader technology sector are Celestica CLS, Zscaler ZS and Coupa Software COUP.

Shares have lost about 13.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Hasbro due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Hasbro Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues SurpassHasbro reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same. The metrics declined on a year-over-year basis. Following the results, shares of Hasbro dropped 3.1% in the pre-market trading session.Earnings &amp; RevenuesDuring the fiscal third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.42, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported an adjusted EPS of $1.96.In the quarter under review, net revenues of $1,675.9 million beat the consensus mark of $1,675.6 million. However, the top line declined 15% on a year-over-year basis.The top-line were impacted by the shifting of release timing for MAGIC: THE GATHERING and entertainment content (into the fourth quarter fiscal 2022).Brand PerformancesDuring the fiscal third quarter, the Franchise Brand reported revenues of $814.1 million, down 12% year over year. During the quarter, Partner Brands’ revenues declined 5% year over year to $349.9 million.Revenues at Hasbro Gaming amounted to $211.3 million, down 25% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. The total gaming category revenues fell 23% year over year to $508.6 million. Emerging Brands’ revenues during the fiscal third quarter decreased 8% year over year to $123.4 million.Revenues from TV/Film/Entertainment slumped 32% year over year to $177.2 million. The downside was mainly due to the absence of comparable film releases in the reported quarter.Story continuesSegmental RevenuesHasbro has three reportable operating segments: Consumer Products, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming and Entertainment.In the fiscal third quarter, net revenues in the Consumer Products segments decreased 10% year over year to $1,160.8 million.

During the quarter, the segment’s adjusted EBITDA came in at $226.5 million compared with $262.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter.During the quarter under review, the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment’s revenues totaled $303.5 million, down 16% from $360.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The dismal performance of tabletop gaming and digital and licensed gaming added to the downside. The segment’s adjusted operating margin came in at 33.7% compared with 44.3% reported in the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, the segment’s adjusted EBITDA came in at $111 million compared with $174.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Revenues in the Entertainment segment declined 35% year over year to $211.6 million.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Aon has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Aon peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Aon will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Aon's Growth Trending?Aon's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 223% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 126% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 8.4% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.0% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.In light of this, it's curious that Aon's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.The Final WordIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that Aon currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Plus, you should also learn about these 3 warning signs we've spotted with Aon (including 1 which is concerning).Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

Recently, MCD crossed above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.Moving Average Chart for MCDMCD has rallied 8.7% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests MCD could be on the verge of another move higher.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider MCD's positive earnings estimate revisions.

303,d82f8a1f-fc27-37fc-aebd-7e4a7f80967b,STX,2022-11-18,Plexus and Seagate have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plexus-seagate-highlighted-zacks-bull-135701971.html,1668693421,STORY,"['TRTN-PC', 'PLXS', 'STX', 'R']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 17, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Plexus Corporation PLXS as the Bull of the Day and Seagate Technology Holdings STX as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Ryder System, Inc. R and Triton International Ltd. TRTN.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:Plexus Corporation, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has recently broken out to the upside in a bullish move that is pushing the stock to new 52-week highs. Simply put, there aren’t many stocks making fresh yearly highs right now. The price movement is a sign of strength, with the general market looking to narrow its yearly losses as we head deeper into the historically positive fourth quarter.PLXS sports the second-highest Zacks Momentum Style Score of ‘B’, indicating a strong likelihood that the stock continues to propel higher on the combination of price performance and earnings momentum. The company is part of the Zacks Electronics – Manufacturing Services industry group, which ranks in the top 1% out of more than 250 industries. Because this group is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company Description   Plexus provides electronic manufacturing services globally. The company offers design and development, supply chain, new product introduction, and manufacturing solutions. PLXS delivers its services to companies in a host of different sectors including healthcare and life sciences, industrial, aerospace and defense, and communications.Story continuesIn its fiscal fourth quarter, PLXS won 32 manufacturing contracts that are worth a combined $214 million in annualized revenues. The company’s expansion into several secular growth markets and massive backlog bode well for the foreseeable future. In addition to its continuation of new program ramps, Plexus has been streamlining its manufacturing facilities to optimize its operations.Earnings Trends and Future EstimatesPLXS has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters with a 17.52% average beat over this timeframe. Last month, the electronic manufacturer reported fiscal Q4 EPS of $1.78/share, a 39.06% surprise over the $1.28 consensus estimate. Revenues of $1.12 billion also exceeded projections by 11.13%.Analysts are bullish on the stock and have been raising earnings estimates across the board. The fiscal Q1 consensus EPS estimate has been revised upward in the past 60 days by 14.84% to $1.47/share. If the company is able to achieve this, it would translate to growth of 67.05% relative to the same quarter last year.Looking ahead, estimates for the current fiscal year appear favorable. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $5.98/share, translating to potential growth of 21.54% relative to last year. Sales are seen rising 17.75% to $4.49 billion. It’s clear that the growth trends for PLXS remain promising.Let’s Get TechnicalIn a bullish sign, PLXS shares bottomed back in February – well before the major indices. Since that time, the stock has advanced more than 40% and is showing no signs of slowing down. After completing a powerful cup-with-handle breakout pattern in October, shares have soared to new 52-week highs. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.The stock has been making a series of higher highs into November. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, PLXS is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Plexus has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and PLXS continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run.Bottom LineBuoyed by a leading industry group, it’s not difficult to see why PLXS is a compelling investment. A healthy number of contract wins along improved operational efficiencies paint a pretty picture for this top-rated stock.Robust sales and earnings growth combined with a strong technical trend certainly warrant a closer look. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions should also serve to create a ‘floor’ in terms of any sudden or unexpected downside moves. If you haven’t already done so, be sure to put PLXS on your shortlist.Bear of the Day:Seagate Technology Holdings, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, is a global provider of data storage technology and solutions. The company provides mass capacity storage products including hard disk drives (HDDs), solid state drives (SSDs), and network-attached drives. Based in Dublin, Ireland, STX sells its products primarily to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.STX faces stiff competition in an evolving industry. The merger between Western Digital and SanDisk has made it more challenging for Seagate to capture market share in the important SSD market. Ongoing global macroeconomic headwinds, high inflation, as well as lingering component shortages are likely to continue to exert pressure on revenues in the short-term.Furthermore, Seagate derives a significant portion of its revenues from outside the United States, subjecting the company to exchange rate volatility. Unfavorable movement in exchange rates can adversely impact results and undermine growth potential.The Zacks RundownSTX has been severely underperforming the market over the past year. This poorly-rated stock experienced a climax top in December of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. Shares are hitting a series of 52-week lows and represent a compelling short opportunity. When a stock can’t even muster a rally when the general market is moving higher, it’s telling us “I’m very weak.”Seagate Technology is part of the Zacks Business Services sector, which currently ranks in the bottom 44% out of all 16 Zacks Ranked Sectors. As such, we expect this sector as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. The Business Services sector has underperformed the market this year at nearly every turn.Candidates in the bottom tiers of sectors can often represent solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poor-performing sector, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies. The odds are stacked against STX and the stock is agreeing with this notion after making a series of lower lows.Weak Foundation: Falling Short on Earnings and Deteriorating ForecastsEarnings misses have been a sore spot for STX during the past year. The data storage provider has fallen short of estimates in three of the past four quarters. STX most recently reported fiscal Q1 EPS last month of $0.48/share, missing the $0.68 consensus estimate by -29.41%. Revenues of $2.03 billion also missed the mark by -1.95%. These are the types of negative trends that the bears like to see.STX has posted an average earnings miss of -11.59% over the past four quarters. Consistently missing earnings estimates by that wide of a margin is a recipe for stock price underperformance.Analysts have been revising earnings estimates downward as of late. For the current quarter, estimates have been slashed -74.8% over the past 30 days. The fiscal Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.32/share, translating to a -86.72% earnings regression relative to the same quarter last year.Technical OutlookSTX stock has been steadily falling since late last year and has now established a well-defined downtrend. Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping down. Shares have declined more than 45% in the past year. The stock continues to trade below both averages – another bearish sign.While not the most accurate indicator, STX has also experienced what is known as a ‘death cross,’ wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. STX would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock.Final ThoughtsThe recent earnings misses in addition to deteriorating estimates are both huge red flags and need to be respected. These will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.STX’s characteristics have resulted in a Zacks Momentum Style Score of ‘C’, indicating further downside is likely. The fact that STX is included in a bottom-performing sector simply adds to the growing list of concerns. Investors will want to steer clear of STX until the situation shows major signs of improvement, or possibly include it as part of a hedge or short strategy.Additional content:2 Dividend-Paying Equipment &amp; Leasing Stocks You May Count OnThe Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry is gaining from strong trade volumes and upbeat container demand, with economic activities picking up. The improvement in the demand scenario with respect to railcars is also a positive for the industry.Given this encouraging backdrop, it would be a wise decision to invest in some dividend-paying stocks like Ryder System, Inc. and Triton International Ltd. from the Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry.Why Dividend Growth Stocks?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.In view of the tailwinds mentioned, it can be safely said that dividend-paying stocks appear as a preferred option compared to non-dividend-paying stocks in periods of a high degree of market volatility such as the present situation.How to Pick Stocks with Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.Ryder: Headquartered in Miami, FL, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) operates as a logistics and transportation company worldwide. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ryder pays out a quarterly dividend of 62 cents ($2.48 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.85% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 16% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate of 3.51%. (Check Ryder’s dividend history here).Ryder is benefiting from strong rental demand and favorable pricing. R’s bullish outlook for 2022 is also encouraging. It now expects total revenues and operating revenues to increase approximately 23% and 18%, respectively, in 2022 (previous view: rise 22% and 16%, respectively). Adjusted EPS for the whole year is estimated in the range of $15.65-$15.85 (prior view: $14.30 - $14.80). R expects free cash flow in the range of $800-900 million (previous view: $750-$850 million) in 2022.  Adjusted ROE (return on investment) is expected to be 26-27% (previous view: 25-26%).Ryder System, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Ryder System, Inc. QuoteTriton International: Headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company engages in the acquisition, leasing, re-leasing, and sale of various types of intermodal containers and chassis to shipping lines, and freight forwarding companies and manufacturers.Concurrent with the third-quarter 2022 earnings release, TRTN’s board of directors has increased its quarterly cash dividend from 65 cents per share to 70 cents, indicating a dividend hike of almost 8%. The raised dividend will be paid out on Dec 22, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 8, 2022.Prior to the dividend hike, Triton paid out a quarterly dividend of 65 cents ($2.60 annualized) per share, which gives it a 4.01% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 23%, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 6.98%. (Check Triton’s dividend history here).Triton International is also active on the buyback front.

304,b988cf12-90cf-300f-b2d9-97450bf97ff2,RHI,2022-11-18,Is It Smart To Buy Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-robert-half-international-103252602.html,1668767572,STORY,['RHI'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Robert Half International's shares before the 23rd of November to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of December.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.43 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.72 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Robert Half International stock has a trailing yield of around 2.3% on the current share price of $75.59. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Robert Half International's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Robert Half International has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Robert Half International Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Robert Half International paying out a modest 27% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Robert Half International generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 33% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that Robert Half International's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Robert Half International's earnings per share have been growing at 19% a year for the past five years. The company has managed to grow earnings at a rapid rate, while reinvesting most of the profits within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Robert Half International has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayHas Robert Half International got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that Robert Half International is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Robert Half International, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.While it's tempting to invest in Robert Half International for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Robert Half International that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

ROWE PRICE LAUNCHES FLOATING RATE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-launches-floating-153800229.html,1668699480,STORY,['TROW'],"[The new fixed income ETF began trading today on NYSE Arca, Inc., and expands the firm's ETF line-up to ten active ETFs BALTIMORE, Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --NEWST. Rowe Price (NASDAQ-GS: TROW), a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement services, announced today the addition of a fifth actively managed fixed income exchange-traded fund (ETF), T. Rowe Price Floating Rate ETF (Ticker: TFLR), which is available to the public beginning today on NYSE Arca, Inc. The new ETF follows last month's launch of T. Rowe Price U.S. High Yield ETF (Ticker: THYF) and brings the firm's total roster of active ETFs to ten.The Floating Rate strategy is constructed similarly to the mutual fund, T. Rowe Price Floating Rate Fund (Ticker: PRFRX), investing primarily in floating-rate loans and other floating rate debt securities. The strategy uses a disciplined approach to credit selection, featuring rigorous proprietary research and strict risk control. It is managed by Paul Massaro, head of the Global High Yield team and portfolio manager of the Floating Rate strategy since its 2008 inception. He has 22 years of investment industry experience, including 19 years at T. Rowe Price.T. Rowe Price Floating Rate ETF (Ticker: TFLR)Seeks high current income and, secondly, capital appreciation. The portfolio manager aims to achieve these objectives by investing primarily in BB and B rated loans, which he believes is likely to keep volatility at below-market rates over time.Broadly diversified across 200-300 issuers.Net expense ratio is 0.61%.The T. Rowe Price active ETF roster now consists of five equity ETFs1 and five fixed income ETFs. The firm's newest ETFs are based on active fixed income strategies that represent some of the largest and fast-growing ETF categories. They offer the alpha generation potential of the firm's time-tested fixed income strategies with the tax-efficient, convenient, and cost-effective benefits of the ETF vehicle.Story continuesQUOTESPaul Massaro, CFA, Head of Global High Yield, Portfolio Manager""Floating rate bank loans hold a unique position across the broad fixed income landscape given their combination of a floating rate coupon and elevated placement in a company's capital structure – an important risk management attribute. Historically, bank loans have provided a partial hedge against rising rates as well as low return correlations with other asset classes, making them a solid portfolio diversifier. Bolstered by our close cooperative working relationship with T. Rowe Price's equity research group and investment-grade credit analysts, we believe this new ETF can serve as a quality actively managed fixed income building block to client solutions.""Tim Coyne, Head of Exchange-Traded Funds""Since the debut of T. Rowe Price's first active ETFs two years ago, we've continued to add to our ETF capabilities and deliver investment choices that complement our other product offerings to meet investors' evolving needs. Today's launch of Floating Rate ETF and the introduction last month of U.S. High Yield ETF represent the latest manifestations of our commitment to building a robust active ETF business. These are compelling strategies managed with T. Rowe Price's characteristic disciplined, research-intensive approach, and we believe they will meet with growing demand from discerning fixed income investors.""ABOUT T. ROWE PRICE Founded in 1937, Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price is a global investment management organization with $1.28 trillion in assets under management as of October 31, 2022. The organization provides a broad array of mutual funds, subadvisory services, and separate account management for individual and institutional investors, retirement plans, and financial intermediaries. The organization also offers a variety of sophisticated investment planning and guidance tools. T. Rowe Price's disciplined, risk-aware investment approach focuses on diversification, style consistency, and fundamental research. For more information, visit troweprice.com, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, or Facebook.Consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this and other information visit troweprice.com. Read it carefully.ETFs are bought and sold at market prices, not NAV. Investors generally incur the cost of the spread between the prices at which shares are bought and sold. Buying and selling shares may result in brokerage commissions which will reduce returns.1T. Rowe Price's equity ETFs are different from traditional ETFs. Traditional ETFs tell the public what assets they hold each day. T. Rowe Price's equity ETFs will not. This may create additional risks for your investment. For example:You may have to pay more money to trade these ETF's shares. These ETFs will provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information.The price you pay to buy ETF shares on an exchange may not match the value of the ETF's portfolio. The same is true when you sell shares. These price differences may be greater for this ETF compared to other ETFs because it provides less information to traders.These additional risks may be even greater in bad or uncertain market conditions.These ETFs will publish on its website each day a ""Proxy Portfolio"" designed to help trading in shares of the ETF. While the Proxy Portfolio includes some of the ETF's holdings, it is not the ETF's actual portfolio.The differences between this ETF and other ETFs may also have advantages. By keeping certain information about the ETF secret, this ETF may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its investment strategy. This may improve the ETF's performance. If other traders are able to copy or predict the ETF's investment strategy, however, this may hurt the ETF's performance.All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. The fund is subject to the risks of fixed-income investing, including interest rate risk and credit risk. Interest rate risk is the decline in bond prices that accompanies a rise in the overall level of interest rates. Credit risk is the chance that any of the fund's holdings will have their credit ratings downgraded or will default (fail to make scheduled interest or principal payments), potentially reducing the fund's income level and share price. Transactions involving floating rate loans often involve borrowers whose financial condition is troubled or highly leveraged, which increases the risk that the fund may not receive its proceeds in a timely manner and that the fund may incur unexpected losses in order to pay redemption proceeds to its shareholders. This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans; the loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds. International investments can be riskier than U.S. investments due to the adverse effects of currency exchange rates, differences in market structure and liquidity, as well as specific country, regional, and economic developments. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/t-rowe-price-launches-floating-rate-exchange-traded-fund-301681735.htmlSOURCE T.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for American Express American Express Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$151. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.All up, insiders sold more shares in American Express than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At American Express Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at American Express. Specifically, insider Walter Clayton bought US$149k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. American Express insiders own about US$129m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At American Express Tell Us?The recent insider purchase is heartening. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. Overall, we'd prefer see a more sustained buying from directors, but with a significant insider holding and more recent purchases, American Express insiders are reasonably well aligned, and optimistic for the future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

""The Brighter Future Fund makes small investments that have big impact with participating farmers – particularly those who face barriers to accessing other types of support.""Previous grants have been used to support:Glenn Hope Care Farm in Red Lion, Pennsylvania, to build a new brooder house and Cornish hen pen to expand its poultry production. The farm’s owner, Aimee Morris, is a female veteran who transitioned her family’s 60-year-old farm into a nonprofit to help veterans overcome the trauma of combat through farming activities.Three Dogs Seed Farm in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, to drill a well and install a solar-powered pump to water crops during periods of drought, increasing the farm’s resilience and viability and reducing crop loss. Danielle Fegan, or Little Fox Woman as she is known in the Ojibwe-Anishinaabe community, started Three Dogs in 2020 to contribute to regional seed and food sovereignty progress for both Tribal and non-Tribal community members through seed offerings and seed-keeping education.VEGGI Farmers Cooperative in New Orleans, Louisiana, to improve infrastructure and mitigate issues such as erosion and flooding. VEGGI farmers are Vietnamese Americans who emigrated to the U.S. after the Vietnam War, many of whom lost their jobs after the BP oil spill. The farm is a way for community members to earn income through produce sales.""AFT is incredibly grateful for the support of partners like Tractor Supply Company that allows us to expand the Brighter Future Fund and impact more farmers than ever before,"" said Ryan Lauer, director of corporate sponsorships at AFT.

Remember, these are the SEC forms that the big money managers have to file 45 days after the end of the quarter which indicate what they have bought, or sold, during the prior quarter.We don’t know when they bought or sold, or at what price, but we do know how big the position was and how many shares were sold.The Value Investor Podcast always checks in on Berkshire Hathaway’s 13-F. In some quarters, Warren Buffett and his two lieutenants have done very little buying or selling. But with stocks selling off, and some deals out there in 2022, Berkshire has been more active.Q3 was no different.Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Shares or Buffett’s Trades? Many value investors like to mimic the trades in Berkshire’s portfolio.But in 2022, with value stocks back in favor, some investors are asking whether or not they shouldn’t just buy Berkshire Hathaway’s stock itself?Is it a deal?Berkshire Hathaway and its Portfolio: Values? 1.       Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) Berkshire Hathaway is more than just the stock portfolio and cash. It owns 62 companies including Dairy Queen, BNSF railroad, Duracell and Benjamin Moore, among others.Shares of Berkshire Hathaway are up 2.8% year-to-date which is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 which is down 17%. Over the last 5 years, it has also outperformed, gaining 70% versus the S&amp;P’s gain of 54.8%.But I’m sorry to tell value fans that Berkshire Hathaway isn’t a cheap stock. It trades with a forward P/E of 22.3. It also has a PEG ratio of 3.2. A PEG under 1.0 indicates value.Story continuesPurely looking at Berkshire on a valuation basis, it probably shouldn’t be on the short list.Is it worth the premium?2.       Taiwan Semiconductor TSMIn the third quarter, Berkshire added shares of Taiwan Semiconductor to the portfolio for the first time. It was a sizable position that puts it in as the 10th largest in the portfolio.Taiwan Semiconductor has an attractive P/E at 12.9. It also pays a dividend yielding 1.7%.Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor are down 32% year-to-date but they’ve rallied 27% in the last month, after Berkshire had bought in.Did Buffett buy at the lows?3.       Louisiana-Pacific Corp. LPXLouisiana-Pacific, the buildings product company which makes items for the residential construction industry, was also added to Berkshire’s portfolio for the first time in the third quarter. It’s just a small position, of only 0.1% of the portfolio.Shares of Louisiana-Pacific have fallen 21% year-to-date. They’re dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of just 5.2.But are they a trap? Louisiana-Pacific is expected to see earnings decline 12.2% this year and 57.7% next year.4.       Chevron Corp. CVXBuffett went all in on Chevron earlier in 2022 but Berkshire added another 2% to the position in the third quarter. Berkshire now owns 8.49% of the company.Shares of Chevron are up 57% year-to-date but they’re still cheap, with a forward P/E of 9.8. In the third quarter, the shares had pulled back, so it’s not surprising that Berkshire added to its position.Chevron pays a dividend of 3.1%.Should you be betting big on Chevron, even after the rally, as Buffett appears to be?5.       Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXYLike with Chevron, Berkshire started aggressively buying Occidental Petroleum earlier this year. But in the third quarter, it jumped in even further, establishing an $11.9 billion position. Berkshire now owns 20.74% of Occidental.Shares of Occidental Petroleum are up 146.7% year-to-date but remain cheap with a forward P/E of 7.5.Occidental has been paying down debt with some of its big free cash flow this year but it still pays a base dividend yielding 0.7%.Berkshire keeps diving into Occidental Petroleum.

316,e336cd84-198d-364b-80f7-a3fb89a74c45,OXY,2022-11-18,Has Occidental Petroleum Corporation's (NYSE:OXY) Impressive Stock Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporations-nyse-oxy-140017792.html,1668693617,STORY,"['OXY', 'CL=F']","[Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 11% over the last three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Occidental Petroleum's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:45% = US$13b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.45 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 45% ROETo begin with, Occidental Petroleum has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 31% which is quite remarkable. However, we are curious as to how the high returns still resulted in a flat growth for Occidental Petroleum in the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesWe then compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 6.8% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Occidental Petroleum fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Occidental Petroleum Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Occidental Petroleum's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 3.1% (implying that the company keeps97% of its income) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth and this should be reflected in its growth number, but that's not the case.Additionally, Occidental Petroleum has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 13% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 17%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, it does look like Occidental Petroleum has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. Additionally, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that analysts expect the company's earnings to continue to shrink in the future.

317,f1f88816-a872-3fcb-ae07-5fa81424d3a8,OXY,2022-11-18,"EIA Oil Supply Data Headlines: Crude Stocks Down, Fuel Up",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eia-oil-supply-data-headlines-130701014.html,1668690421,STORY,"['MRO', 'OXY', 'HO=F', 'CL=F', 'HES']","[U.S. oil prices moved down on Nov 16 after government data showed a weekly build in gasoline and distillate supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $85.59 a barrel yesterday — the lowest since Oct 25.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Nov 11.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.4 million barrels compared to expectations of a 400,000-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and higher refinery demand accounted for the big stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer.Total domestic stocks now stand at 435.4 million barrels — 0.6% more than the year-ago figure but 4% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 1.6 million barrels to 25.6 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 28 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.5 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the first time in five weeks. The 2.2 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to a pullback in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would fall 800,000 barrels. At 207.9 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 1.9% less than the year-earlier level and 5% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) increased after dropping last week. The 1.1 million-barrel gain reflected a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 500,000 barrels. Despite last week’s build, current inventories — at 107.4 million barrels — are 13.2% below the year-ago level and 15% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 92.9%, rose 0.8% from the prior week.Story continuesFinal WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 66% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 17%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Marathon Oil MRO.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 148%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 289.4% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $68 billion.Hess Corporation: Hess shares have appreciated 98% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 231.1% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $46 billion, enjoys a Zacks Growth Style Score of A.

He cites three influences for his patriotism: his grandfathers, who fought in World War II; his gratitude at having been adopted from South Korea as a baby; and 9/11, which hit home for Sean in more ways than one.Boston Scientific, Thursday, November 17, 2022, Press release picture""My mother worked in the World Financial Center, directly next to the World Trade Center,"" says Sean, a senior talent acquisition specialist at Boston Scientific.Sean was in high school on September 11, 2001, and remembers watching television along with his English class, horror-struck, as the Twin Towers fell. His suburban New York town was home to many police and firefighters - including his own fireman father - and while thankfully Sean's parents were unharmed that day, many of his classmates' parents never made it home. Sean knew exactly what he wanted to do after graduation. In 2005, he enlisted in the U.S. Army to fight in Iraq.Finding purpose in Iraq and Afghanistan""Yeah, joining during a war is pretty crazy,"" Sean admits with a grin. ""But that's what I wanted. I was raising my hand nonstop to go there.""Deployed to Tikrit, Sean worked in the 115-degree heat as a field artillery supervisor, feeling proud to play a part in history as it unfolded. Much of his time was spent delivering supplies to combat outposts while avoiding the improvised explosive devices that lay hidden along Iraq's dusty highways. ""It was frightening, because everything was unexpected,"" Sean recalls of his year in Iraq, adding, ""But it wasn't like Afghanistan.""His subsequent yearlong deployment to Afghanistan was a relentless experience. As a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, Sean was stationed in a small combat outpost in a remote, snow-covered mountain range. They faced daily rocket and mortar attacks by the Taliban and regularly came under small-arms fire as they patrolled. ""That's a life-or-death adrenaline rush,"" says Sean. ""And you have to make the right decisions, not just for your safety, but for the others as well.""Story continuesSean's mission was to collect biometric data on military-aged men through iris scanning and fingerprinting in order to identify bomb-makers and ""high value targets."" For its good work, his team received a recognition from the Pentagon police, which Sean found rewarding. The camaraderie among his fellow soldiers would also make a lifelong impact. ""When you're there, you're not an individual. You're a team,"" he says. ""When one person succeeds or fails, you all succeed or fail.""Return to civilian life, and to a new missionOther, darker things also stayed with Sean. After witnessing the devastation of two wars, Sean found himself suffering from paralyzing feelings of anxiety, depression, hypervigilance, and insomnia. He was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Of all of Sean's acts of bravery in the military, seeking the help he needed may have been among the bravest. ""It was necessary, and not just for me, but as a husband and a father,"" he says. He was reassigned as an Army recruiter, a job Sean enjoyed until retiring from the military in 2021, after 17 years of service.With a decade of recruitment experience under his belt, Sean had hoped to find a civilian career in human resources. Yet he would apply for jobs for over a year without a bite - a common quandary for returning veterans, who tend to lack the professional networks necessary to land a civilian job, and often find that companies have a hard time seeing how their skills translate to the corporate workplace. These obstacles are among the reasons why a Pew Research Center study found that half of post-9/11 veterans (47%) report their readjustment to civilian life as very or somewhat difficult.""Everybody tells you in the military how valuable your skills are. And then you get out, and you realize some people don't think they're that valuable,"" says Sean. Then he brightens: ""The only offer I ever got was from Boston Scientific.""Commitment to serviceCommitment to the military community runs deep at Boston Scientific. Its efforts have earned the company the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award-the highest recognition given by the U.S. government to employers for their exceptional support of veteran employees-as well as recognition as a Yellow Ribbon Company for supporting service members, military families and veterans as they transition to employment. Through the company's affiliation with American Corporate Partners, dozens of Boston Scientific volunteers are paired with fellow service members looking to transition to the civilian workforce, providing much-needed career mentorship and guidance. In addition, the VETS employee resource group (ERG), Boston Scientific employees who network and volunteer together, actively raises awareness of community issues in support of veteran and active-duty employees, as well as their families.""We at Boston Scientific are grateful to our veteran community,"" says Mike Jones, executive sponsor of VETS. ""We couldn't be prouder to call them our friends and colleagues, and to do whatever we can to support them.""Today, Sean is proud to serve as the co-lead of the VETS ERG in his workplace of Maple Grove, Minnesota, where he goes to work each day with his service dog, Morrie. In his role within Talent Acquisition, Sean is passionate about using his insights to recruit the most promising and talented people, including those from non-traditional backgrounds. And he is finding a new sense of purpose, and of service, in the Boston Scientific mission of improving lives through patient care. ""The work that we do, it's rewarding, it's meaningful. It really changes people's lives on not just the small scale, but on a global scale,"" Sean reflects. ""We are changing people's lives every day.""For more about career opportunities for veterans at Boston Scientific, visit here.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Boston Scientific on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Boston ScientificWebsite: https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/Home.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Boston ScientificView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/726680/A-Life-of-Service--As-a-Soldier-a-Veteran-and-at-Boston-Scientific]"

322,31ff3b71-2fa1-3fa8-a1f5-977b9d07595a,VRTX,2022-11-18,An Intrinsic Calculation For Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) Suggests It's 37% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-vertex-pharmaceuticals-incorporated-130009281.html,1668776409,STORY,['VRTX'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.00bUS$4.57bUS$4.95bUS$5.40bUS$5.73bUS$6.02bUS$6.26bUS$6.47bUS$6.67bUS$6.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 6.2%Est @ 4.94%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$3.8kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$160bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$160b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$87bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$127b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$310, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.851. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Techne are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that VRTX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.VRTX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.91, while TECH has a forward P/E of 41.73. We also note that VRTX has a PEG ratio of 1.75. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TECH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.61.Another notable valuation metric for VRTX is its P/B ratio of 6.02. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TECH has a P/B of 7.81.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, VRTX holds a Value grade of B, while TECH has a Value grade of D.VRTX sticks out from TECH in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that VRTX is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Valued at $14.1 million, the contract is expected to get completed by December 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide non-recurring engineering, supplies and support necessary for the low-rate initial production Lot 1 deployable configuration updates for the CH-53K heavy lift replacement aircraft.Work related to the deal will be carried out in West Palm Beach, FL.Benefits of the ContractCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and the integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide, is also strengthening military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Boeing BA and Textron TXT, which also have expertise in manufacturing military aircraft.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Textron (NYSE:TXT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Textron Textron's Improving ProfitsEven modest earnings per share growth (EPS) can create meaningful value, when it is sustained reliably from year to year. So it's easy to see why many investors focus in on EPS growth. Textron's EPS has risen over the last 12 months, growing from US$3.43 to US$4.04. There's little doubt shareholders would be happy with that 18% gain.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It was a year of stability for Textron as both revenue and EBIT margins remained have been flat over the past year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Textron's forecast profits?Are Textron Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$15b company like Textron. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$60m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Story continuesIs Textron Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Textron is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. If you think Textron might suit your style as an investor, you could go straight to its annual report, or you could first check our discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for the company.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

The company operates in more than 200 countries and owns or licenses over 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero, Minute Maid Juices and Dasani.Some investors might worry about this company because of the decreasing global demand for sodas. According to a GlobalData report, traditional soft drinks declined 4.3% worldwide in 2020, and while growth in emerging markets may still be found, developed markets such as the U.S. are becoming more health-conscious, to the detriment of soda sales. According to a Harvard study, the percentage of Americans bingeing on soft drinks frequently declined significantly from 13% in 2013 to 9% in 2016. Some countries are also introducing sugar taxes, which are taking their toll on sugar-laden soft drinks.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with KO. Click here to check it out. KO 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KOPeter Lynch Chart of KOTo combat this decline in soda popularity, Coca-Cola has diversified its product portfolio into other categories such as sparkling soft drinks, water, sports drinks and ready-to-drink coffee and tea beverages, which helped it avoid the worst of the pain. The strength of the Coca-Cola brand has also done well despite headwinds such as inflation and logistical issues. This resilience combined with decent returns through dividends and share buybacks makes me positive on Coca-Cola overall.Coca-Cola flexes its financial muscle in a difficult marketCoca-Cola posted revenue of $11.06 billion in the third quarter of 2022, which showed an increase of 10.17% from $10.04 billion in the year-ago quarter. The earnings per share reflected an increase of 14% in the third quarter of 2022, rising to $0.65 from $0.57 in the prior-year quarter. The currency exchange rates during the quarter negatively affected the beverage giant, which impacted the bottom line.Story continuesThe company had single-digit returns from the developed countries, while lower single-digit results came from developing countries. China, India and Brazil drove higher revenues, as did the United States, Mexico and Western Europe. Coca-Cola has been working to make its beverages more relevant and adjust to consumer trends to spur future growth. The company has also been prioritizing margins over volume to be more profit-oriented.Coca-Cola has long been one of the world's most recognizable brands but has faced several challenges in recent years. For example, in Russia, Coca-Cola's decision to halt operations in the wake of the country's invasion of Ukraine will likely have financial repercussions in the years to come. Russia and Ukraine operations previously accounted for around 1% of its total consolidated net operating revenue and 2% of operating profits.Due to pandemic-related interruptions in the world's supply chains, costs for everything from aluminum cans to labor and shipping have increased over the past year, prompting businesses in the packaged food industry to raise prices in response. The company has managed the situation reasonably well, aided by plants in just about all the regions in the world.Global demand for soda is decreasing, but Coca-Cola has continued to diversifyCoca-Cola is one of the most iconic brands in the world, and for a good reason. The company has been around for over a century, and people of all ages enjoy its products. However, Coca-Cola is not immune to changing market trends. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the health risks associated with soda, and as a result, many consumers are seeking alternative beverage options. New research from food broker Presence reveals that health-conscious consumers will pay extra if a product positively impacts their health.This has significantly impacted the soda industry, and Coca-Cola has had to adapt to stay relevant. The company has diversified its offerings and now has several bottled water brands, energy drinks, juices, sports drinks, teas and vitamin water. These changes allow the company to survive and thrive even if the demand in one central area slows down.A stable income playCoca-Cola has maintained a long tradition of paying dividends, delivering a robust 2.9% dividend yield as of this writing. In total, the company has hiked payouts for 60 years consecutively, making it a Dividend King. The business anticipates that share repurchases will start again in 2022, with net share repurchases totaling about $500 million. For investors looking for a stable income play, I believe Coca-Cola is a good bet. The share price does not fluctuate much, and returns are pretty reasonable even if not particularly high.Coca-Cola has historically been a reliable investment, and shareholders have always been able to count on the company to deliver consistent dividend payments. While other companies have cut or suspended their dividend payments in recent years, Coca-Cola has continued to pay out dividends without fail. This commitment to shareholder value is one of the things that makes Coca-Cola such a popular stock.TakeawayCoca-Cola is one of the most well-known brands in the world, and it has a long history of success. In recent years, Coca-Cola has faced some challenges but has continued to perform well financially. Despite inflation and other factors, Coca-Cola has all of its ducks in a row and is doing well during tough times. The company has a strong portfolio of products, strong brand recognition and a loyal customer base. In addition, Coca-Cola has a diversified business model that includes beverages to keep up with market trends. As a result, I believe Coca-Cola is well-positioned to continue its success in the years to come.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (AMS:CCEP).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is:18% = €1.4b ÷ €7.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every €1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn €0.18 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has a higher ROE than the average (12%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' Debt And Its 18% Return On EquityCoca-Cola Europacific Partners clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.54. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Coca-Cola Europacific Partners may not be the best stock to buy.

(NASDAQ:INTU) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 18% in the last quarter. But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. It's fair to say most would be happy with 160% the gain in that time. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 38% drop, in the last year.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Intuit In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Intuit managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 53.71.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Intuit's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Intuit's TSR for the last 5 years was 169%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Intuit shareholders are down 38% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 22% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Intuit has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Stryker certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Stryker peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Stryker.Does Growth Match The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Stryker's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 29%. Despite this strong recent growth, it's still struggling to catch up as its three-year EPS frustratingly shrank by 29% overall. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 13% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.0% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Stryker's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.As we suspected, our examination of Stryker's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Story continuesIt's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Stryker, and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Stryker, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:VRSN). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock, it seems odd VeriSign is not more well-covered by analysts. Although, there is more of an opportunity for mispricing in stocks with low coverage, which can be a good thing. So, could the stock still be trading at a low price relative to its actual value? Let’s examine VeriSign’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for VeriSign Is VeriSign Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, VeriSign seems to be fairly priced at around 13.24% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy VeriSign today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $172.69, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because VeriSign’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will VeriSign generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of VeriSign, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 8.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in VRSN’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on VRSN, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for VeriSign (1 is significant) you should be familiar with.If you are no longer interested in VeriSign, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Using LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec technology, this commercial scale advanced recycling plant would convert pre-treated plastic waste into feedstock for new plastic production.  The final investment decision is targeted for the end of 2023.The previously announced German Joint Venture Source One Plastics will provide plastic waste  feedstock to the plant. Source One Plastics is planning to build a facility designed to recycle the amount of plastic packaging waste generated by approximately 1.3 million German citizens per year. This plastic waste will consist of materials such as multi-layered food packaging items or mixed plastic containers that are typically not recycled today.""We are actively working to move the circular economy forward. Progressing our MoReTec technology represents another step LyondellBasell is making to accelerate the development and implementation of scalable sustainable and circular technology,"" said Yvonne van der Laan, LyondellBasell Executive Vice President, Circular and Low Carbon Solutions. ""This high yield, differential technology will allow us to convert plastic waste into pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gas for use in our crackers as feedstock leading to the production of new plastic materials. Solid process residues can be re-used or consumed in other applications, making this technology an energy efficient, zero waste process for the recycling of plastic waste"".The start-up of the MoReTec advanced recycling plant is planned for end of 2025 with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes per year. The feedstock produced will be converted at the LyondellBasell Wesseling site into new CirculenRevive polymers for use in applications such as food packaging and healthcare products.MoReTec - A story of innovationIn 2018, LyondellBasell began conducting base research in the chemical recycling of plastic waste together with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, which proved the efficiency of the MoReTec technology at laboratory scale. In October 2019, the company announced the construction of a chemical recycling pilot plant at its Ferrara, Italy, site, which begun operation in August 2020. With the operation of the pilot plant, research work improved the efficiency of the recycling process, identified a commercial catalyst and made further progress in the characterization of the waste feedstock stream. The MoReTec plant capability was further expanded converting the pilot plant to a small scale industrial facility in 2021.Story continuesToday, the MoReTec technology allows for the recycling of most types of plastic materials such as multi-layered food packaging items or mixed plastic containers. Polyolefin-based plastic waste is decomposed in a proprietary reactor unit, resulting in high-quality feedstock usable for the production of new plastic materials at the LyondellBasell polymer plants.About LyondellBasellAs a leader in the global chemical industry, LyondellBasell strives every day to be the safest, best operated and most valued company in our industry.

This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for General Electric The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General ElectricThe Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 each. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$85.39), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 74.54k shares worth US$5.6m. On the other hand they divested 1.44k shares, for US$107k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by General Electric insiders.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. General Electric insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$228m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About General Electric Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much.

Chinese authorities on Thursday called the allegations against Xu ""untrue.""Prosecutors had asked for a 25-year sentence to act as a deterrent against similar actions, but Xu's lawyers said in earlier court filings that such a sentence would exceed those given to other people convicted of such crimes.""Today's sentence demonstrates the seriousness of those crimes and the Justice Department's determination to investigate and prosecute efforts by the Chinese government, or any foreign power, to threaten our economic and national security,"" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.Xu, 42, accused of being a career intelligence officer for China's Ministry of State Security, was detained in Belgium in 2018 after a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.He was alleged to have used aliases and front companies between 2013 and 2018 to target multiple U.S. aviation and aerospace companies, including GE Aviation, a unit of General Electric Co.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the accusations against Xu ""are simply untrue.""""We ask the U.S. side to handle the case without bias and in accordance with the law and protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens,"" Mao told a regular news briefing in Beijing on Thursday.U.S. officials say the Chinese government poses the biggest long-term threat to U.S. economic and national security, and is carrying out unprecedented efforts to steal critical technology from U.S. businesses and researchers.FBI Director Christopher Wray has said his agency opens a new counterintelligence case related to China about twice a day.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy Is Valero Energy Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.32bUS$4.65bUS$3.90bUS$3.92bUS$3.47bUS$3.22bUS$3.08bUS$3.00bUS$2.96bUS$2.95bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -11.29%Est @ -7.31%Est @ -4.52%Est @ -2.57%Est @ -1.21%Est @ -0.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$5.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.0kUS$2.8kUS$2.3kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.0%) = US$43bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$43b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$18bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$44b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$138, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Valero Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.358. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For Valero Energy, we've put together three additional elements you should assess:Risks: For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Valero Energy  that you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does VLO's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NYSE:EL) stock rose 4.2% last week, insiders who sold US$13m worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$268, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Estée Lauder CompaniesThe President, Fabrizio Freda, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.3m worth of shares at a price of US$268 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$228. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In the last year Estée Lauder Companies insiders didn't buy any company stock.

In total, insiders dumped US$8.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Estée Lauder Companies insiders own about US$11b worth of shares (which is 13% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Estée Lauder Companies Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

349,77fac69e-aecf-38f4-b42b-d7918a72a0e7,EL,2022-11-18,Estee Lauder's China Problem,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estee-lauders-china-problem-215005051.html,1668721805,STORY,['EL'],"[Shares of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) are down nearly 40% this year as investors remain concerned about its exposure to the Chinese market.Estee Lauder's China ProblemEstee Lauder stated in its 10-K filing that its largest customer primarily sells products in China and accounted for 13% of its consolidated net sales and 24% of accounts receivable for fiscal 2022. The company has a physical retail presence in over 141 Chinese cities, and roughly one-fourth of Estee Lauder's revenue is generated in the Asia/Pacific region. The stock of companies with significant exposure to the country also took a massive hit following Chinese President Xi Jinping's confirmation of a third term last month.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with EL. Click here to check it out. EL 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ELPeter Lynch Chart of ELThe Chinese Communist Party held its twice-per-decade summit in October, in which the party selected top leadership positions and Xi secured a third term as the leader of the party and the nation. Investors and market experts believe this will allow him to continue his aggressive and strict regulations, such as the zero-Covid policy, which has had a significant impact on businesses. Companies that rely heavily on the Chinese market have experienced a notable slowdown in growth this year because of new cases in the country that have triggered regional lockdowns. Both retailers and customers alike remain under pressure because of these strict mobility restrictions. These policies, if continued, are very likely to send Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. and American companies reliant on the Chinese market into free fall in the coming quarters.The Chinese government did not reverse the policies despite the slowing economy and rising geopolitical tensions. Instead, regulators seem to be prioritizing security, self-sufficiency and social stability, focusing on increasing domestic demand and reducing reliance on imports. Few strategists expect a complete decoupling of the world's two largest economiesChina and the U.S.in some critical areas as they focus on national security.Story continuesThis comes after the United States took steps to limit China's access to critical technologies. Although the restrictions currently apply to tech companies selling sensitive technology, other markets, such as fashion, luxury and food, are not immune to these ongoing tensions. As the relationship between the two countries remains uncertain, it has created a new level of volatility for companies who have invested in China to capitalize on its rapid growth.Chinas Covid-19 policies are curtailing Estee Lauders growth On Aug. 18, Estee Lauder reported full-year 2022 financial results, recording $17.74 billion in net sales, a 9% increase supported by double-digit growth in the Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. The company saw brick-and-mortar retail stores recover strongly in all regions except China, while also experiencing double-digit growth in global online and travel retail. The resurgence of Covid-19 cases in many Chinese provinces prompted restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading further in February and lasted through August. As a result, the company's distribution facilities in Shanghai operated at reduced capacity until early June, slowing retail traffic.China continues to impose lockdowns on schools, restaurants and stores, as well as apartment buildings and neighborhoods. In China, 1,321 new Covid cases were reported in the last week of October. The disruptive restrictions caused hundreds of workers to flee Foxconn, the world's largest iPhone factory. According to Bloomberg, experts believe China will stick with the zero -Covid policies, including lockdowns, mass testing and travel restrictions, through the winter. Health experts do not expect any changes until the next National People's Congress, which will be held in March or April of next year. This indicates that businesses can expect sluggish growth in the Asia-Pacific region in the current quarter as well.Exhibit 1: Estee Lauder net sales by geographic regionEstee Lauder's China ProblemSource: Investor presentation.In addition to pressures in China, a stronger dollar has also hurt net sales in some product categories in EMEA. Skincare net sales increased by 4%, aided by increases in the La Mer, Clinique and Bobbi Brown brands. Estee Lauder partly attributed the single-digit growth to lower-than-expected revenue in the EMEA region after it suspended commercial activities in Russia and Ukraine as well as the negative effects of increased pandemic-related restrictions in China. La Mer and Bobbi Brown, on the other hand, experienced double-digit growth among Chinese consumers in both mainland China and travel retail, as well as in other regions. Makeup sales increased 11% year over year, aided by the continued recovery in Western markets. Net sales in the fragrance product category increased 30% year over year across all regions and fragrance brands, led by Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beaut, and Le Labo. However, growth may come to a standstill this holiday season as consumer purchasing power is shrinking in many developed markets.Valuation does not seem attractive unless China turns aroundEven on the back of a 40% decline in market value this year, Estee Lauder is still valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of over 40, which suggests Mr. Market is still placing a massive value on the expected growth of the company. At a time when growth companies are getting hammered in the market, Estee Lauder's valuation seems bloated even before accounting for its troubles in China.The cosmetics company may be able to make a strong comeback once China lifts its strict lockdown measures. However, it is unclear when the country will fully reopen. In addition, global demand for premium skincare and beauty products is slowing. With the rising cost of living, the lipstick effect the notion that people will continue to buy small luxury items even during recessions - will begin to fade. According to McKinsey, there is an increase in the number Europeans who are reducing their spending on non-food discretionary items, and one in 10 say they plan to shop less or not at all.Exhibit 2: Price changes observed by respondents in the last three monthsEstee Lauder's China ProblemSource: McKinsey &amp; Co.Given these looming challenges, Estee Lauder issued cautious guidance for the current fiscal year. The company expects total revenue growth of only 3% to 5% in fiscal 2023, with organic sales growth of 7% to 9%. The guidance itself is lackluster for a company that is valued at more than 40 times expected earnings for next year. If the company misses this guidance - which is a high-probability scenario because of its exposure to China - the market is likely to punish the stock.TakeawayEstee Lauder is one of the most profitable companies in the beauty space and has the strongest brand in premium cosmetics and skincare, with a global customer base. However, disruptions in supply chains, inflationary pressures and China's zero-Covid policies are weighing on the companys growth. The company appears to be fundamentally capable of overcoming its current challenges in the long run, which is why a significant pullback may present a good long-term investment opportunity. However, global consumer sentiment and retail spending are likely to remain low for some time, implying that investors will have to remain patient to make the most of such an investment. At the current market price, the risk-reward profile does not seem to be in favor of investors.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Automatic Data Processing with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Automatic Data Processing's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, Automatic Data Processing has grown EPS by 10% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Automatic Data Processing's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. While we note Automatic Data Processing achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 9.9% to US$17b. That's a real positive.Story continuesThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Automatic Data Processing.Are Automatic Data Processing Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$105b company like Automatic Data Processing. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$127m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Automatic Data Processing Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Automatic Data Processing is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Automatic Data Processing   you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Automatic Data Processing (ADP) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ADP for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Automatic Data Processing's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Automatic Data Processing's main business drivers.Automatic Data Processing, Inc. is one of the leading providers of cloud-based Human Capital Management (HCM) technology solutions - including payroll, talent management, Human Resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management - to employers around the world. The company delivers it’s global HCM strategy and make investments in highly strategic areas and technology in order to strengthen its underlying business model and prospects for continued growth.The company was founded in 1949, incorporated in the State of Delaware in June 1961 and completed its initial public offering in September 1961. The company serves more than 740,000 clients across 110 countries and territories.ADP has two reportable business segments – Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services.Employer Services: The Employer Services segment offers a comprehensive suite of HRO and technology-based HCM solutions which includes payroll services, benefits administration, talent management, HR management, time and attendance management, insurance services, retirement services and compliance services. The company mainly serves clients ranging from single-employee small businesses to large enterprises with tens of thousands of employees around the world. In fiscal 2021, revenues from this segment increased 1% year over year on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis.Story continuesProfessional Employer Organization (PEO) Services: The Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services segment provides small and medium-sized businesses with employment administration outsourcing solutions, including payroll, payroll tax filing, HR guidance, 401(k) plan administration, benefits administration, compliance services, health and workers' compensation coverage, and other supplemental benefits for the employees. Revenues from this segment increased 8% on a year over year basis in fiscal 2021.ADP’s PEO business, named ADP TotalSource is the largest PEO in the United States based on the number of worksite employees. It serves approximately 12,500 clients and more than 562,000 worksite employees across 50 states and operates as a certified PEO under the United States Internal Revenue Code.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Automatic Data Processing, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $4,633.18, or a 363.32% gain, as of November 17, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 191.11% and the price of gold went up -0.46% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for ADP.ADP's shares have outperformed its industry in the past year, partly due to consecutive earnings and revenue beat in the past four quarters. The company continues to enjoy a dominant position in the human capital management market through strategic buyouts like Celergo, WorkMarket, Global Cash Card and The Marcus Buckingham Company. It has a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure. Further, it continues to innovate, improve operations and invest in its ongoing transformation efforts. On the flip side, ADP faces significant competition in each of its product lines. Failure to remain technologically updated might reduce the demand for its solutions and services. Rising expenses due to investment in transformation efforts remains a concern. High debt remains a concern.The stock is up 8.74% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 10 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Procter &amp; Gamble's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Procter &amp; Gamble is:33% = US$15b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.33 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Procter &amp; Gamble's Earnings Growth And 33% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Procter &amp; Gamble has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 17% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Procter &amp; Gamble was able to see a decent net income growth of 13% over the last five years.We then compared Procter &amp; Gamble's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 5.4% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is PG worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PG is currently mispriced by the market.Is Procter &amp; Gamble Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 59% (or a retention ratio of 41%) for Procter &amp; Gamble suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Procter &amp; Gamble has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 60%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Procter &amp; Gamble's future ROE will be 37% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Procter &amp; Gamble's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 richest airlines in the world.The importance of the global airline industry cannot be understated. The expansion and growth of the industry has been one of the most important factors behind globalization, connecting people and facilitating international trade. In 2014, according to estimates provided by the Air Transport Action Group, the total economic impact of the airline industry, including both direct and indirect, was around $2.7 trillion, contributing close to 3.5% of the world's GDP. While the bulk of cargo transportation is still carried out through sea due to efficiency, ability to transport a large quantity of goods at the same time and lower costs, airlines can transport goods much faster which is important for time-sensitive transportation. But perhaps the biggest impact of airlines is on the tourism industry, allowing people to travel from one end of the world to the other in less than a day.While flying was initially limited to the rich for several decades because of the costs associated with it, low-cost carriers have now ensured that flying is accessible to a lot more people, with tickets within Europe on many low-cost carriers often being available on deals for less than $20 - $30.Richest Airlines in the worldtoa-heftiba-DdFnqbvPuOE-unsplashDespite the many benefits that airlines provide, contributing heavily to the economy and providing employment to millions of people across the world, it has come in for criticism as well. The carbon footprint of flying in an airplane is significantly higher than other forms of transportation, including ships and trains, which is why governments have taken steps to convince people to take other forms of transportation as opposed to airlines. There are also complaints regarding the quality of services provided including high rates of cancellation and high barriers to entry, since setting up an airline company is a hugely capital-intensive process which is why competition is often not very high. Add to that complaints about airlines adding as many seats as possible while affecting the comfort of passengers, it is obvious that there is a scope of improvement within the industry as well.Story continuesThe Covid-19 pandemic, which affected the world in 2020, had devastating consequences for the airline industry, with most countries locking down in an effort to contain the spread of the disease. This resulted in international travel and mostly domestic travel coming to a complete shutdown, and with the barriers to travel imposed once international travel resumed, including vaccinations and forms, travel only very slowly started to pick up till early 2022. From 2020 to 2022, the global airline industry has been estimated to have lost more than $200 billion and job cuts for tens of thousands of people across the industry.In 2022, global travel finally started to resume as most countries eased travel restrictions and people all across the world started to look forward to life beyond the pandemic. And just when things started to look up again, the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, which has affected airspace as well.Despite the aforementioned issues, the airline industry has shown incredible resilience to cater to extremely high demand in 2022. In fact, Q2 2022 was said to be among the most profitable quarters in the history of the industry after cutting costs and jacking up prices, with the price per mile being higher than ever before in history. Passengers have come out in droves, which has led to airports being unprepared to handle the influx, resulting in flight cancellations and Heathrow Airport in London announcing that it would cap the number of passengers at 100,000 per day, resulting in a conflict with airlines who had prepared for the higher number of passengers but had to cancel flights anyway.The future outlook does look good though for airlines in 2023. Most airlines expect to return to profitability as the pent-up demand for travel looks to sustain bookings in the next year. Despite the higher demand in 2022, losses for the year are still expected to be around $9.7 billion, according to the International Air Transport Association. According to Moody's, the operating profit for the airline industry is expected to increase by more than 200% in 2023, which will be a relief for most of the richest airlines in the world, which have still been in a loss in their latest financial reports.While there will be a lot of commonalities between the richest airlines in the world and the biggest airlines in the world, the method of assessment is incredibly different. While the biggest airlines are based on revenue, market cap, assets, profits and employees, the richest airlines have been assessed based on cash, profits, gross margins and net debt. The lower the net debt, the richer the company is. For our rankings, we have checked the latest profit and loss and balance sheet items of each company through Yahoo Finance, while assigning 40% weightage to cash in hand and 20% weightage to the other three criteria. Most airline have been struggling to return to profitability and so, have negative margins and net losses with high levels of net debt. Thus, airlines which have managed some semblance of profits or low level of losses with high cash reserves have ranked much higher on our list. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the richest companies in a major industry, starting with number 10:10. IAGTotal cash and cash equivalents of the company (in millions): $8,224Total net profit of the company (in millions): -$3,050Gross margin of the company: -8.2%Total net debt of the company (in millions): $2,164The Anglo-Spanish company owns many of the biggest airlines in Europe, including Iberia, the flag carrier of Spain, and British Airways, the flag carrier of the United Kingdom. In addition to these, IAG also owns other airlines including budget airline Vueling, Aer Lingus and BMI. The company currently has more than 50,000 employees.9. Air France - KLMTotal cash and cash equivalents of the company (in millions): $7,077Total net profit of the company (in millions): -$3,424Gross margin of the company: 21.7%Total net debt of the company (in millions): $2,631Founded 18 years ago through the merger of French France Air and Dutch KLM, Air France - KLM is one of the biggest and richest airlines in Europe, with headquarters in Paris and Amsterdam.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton Eaton Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, April Boise, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$139 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$163. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 43% of April Boise's stake.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Eaton shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Eaton Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Eaton. Specifically, Executive VP &amp; CFO Thomas Okray ditched US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Eaton insiders own about US$231m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Eaton Insiders?An insider sold Eaton shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But it is good to see that Eaton is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Eaton you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ:PEP) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.95bUS$9.90bUS$10.5bUS$11.2bUS$11.8bUS$12.2bUS$12.7bUS$13.0bUS$13.4bUS$13.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.84%Est @ 3.98%Est @ 3.38%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.67%Est @ 2.46% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$8.4kUS$8.8kUS$8.8kUS$8.9kUS$8.8kUS$8.6kUS$8.4kUS$8.1kUS$7.9kUS$7.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$84bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$341bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$341b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$189bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$273b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$180, the company appears about fair value at a 8.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PepsiCo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For PepsiCo, we've compiled three relevant factors you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - PepsiCo has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for PEP's future outlook?

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) share price has soared 111% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! On top of that, the share price is up 20% in about a quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share growth of 37% per year. The average annual share price increase of 28% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 14% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE:DGX) share price is up 58% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 44% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 0.7% in the last year , including dividends .Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 4.3%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Quest Diagnostics managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 10% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Quest Diagnostics' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Quest Diagnostics the TSR over the last 5 years was 75%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Quest Diagnostics shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 0.7% over one year. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 12% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Quest Diagnostics that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

""We continue to rely heavily on markdowns and discounting to sell-through styles this quarter and have reduced receipts in Q4.""Gap's inventory ballooned 12% year over year in the third quarter amid a broader slowdown in consumer spending. Comparable sales were up a meager 1% as lower income shoppers pulled back on trips to Old Navy and consumers overall bought more cautiously on discretionary items.The aggressive posture on discounting — which will likely hammer Gap's profit margins in the critical holiday season — comes hot on the heels of another lackluster quarter and ongoing search for a permanent CEO.Net sales rose 2% from the prior year to $4.04 billion. Sales at Old Navy rose a meager 2%, while the Gap brand saw sales stay stagnant from a year ago. Sales at Athleta rose 6%.Adjusted gross profit margins tanked 320 basis points from a year ago.Gap shares managed to rise 7% in pre-market trading on Friday as earnings of 71 cents a share beat estimates for breakeven.The company said it sees fourth quarter sales falling by a mid-single digit percentage.

Nancy Pelosi has announced she is standing down as the senior member of the Democrat Party in the House of Representatives, ending an era. President Joe Biden signals a thawing in the relations with Saudi Arabia, while companies will be looking to the FIFA World Cup for a sales bounce. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 18th November.1. FTX fallout continuesThe collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX continues to reverberate, as Genesis Block, a leading cryptocurrency retail service provider in Hong Kong, announced Friday it was ceasing trading.""We have ceased trading, as we don't know which counterparties would fail next, so we would rather close out all our positions to regain some of our liquidity,"" chief executive Wincent Hung said, according to Reuters.This followed FTX filing for bankruptcy last week, at which point the company's new CEO, John J. Ray III, said that the company's situation involved a ""complete failure of corporate controls.""There is now likely to be an unsightly scramble for the FTX assets which still exist, with the Securities Commission of The Bahamas ordering the transfer of all FTX digital assets to a digital wallet owned by the commission ""for safekeeping.""There has also already been a lawsuit filed in Miami by FTX account holders claiming deceptive business practices, and this is likely the first of many that will be brought given the billions of dollars in losses on the cryptocurrency exchange.2. End of the Pelosi eraThe loss of control of the House of Representatives by the Democrats as a result of the U.S. midterm elections also marks the end of Nancy Pelosi's long career of congressional leadership.Pelosi announced on Thursday during a speech that she would give up her House leadership role but remain in Congress, representing San Francisco as she has done since 1987.Story continuesShe was the highest ranking and most powerful elected woman in U.S. history until Kamala Harris became vice president in January 2021, having served two stints as speaker, first from 2007 to 2011 and then regaining the job in 2019.President Joe Biden, in a statement, called Pelosi ""the most consequential speaker of the House of Representatives in our history.""She will be replaced as House speaker by Republican Kevin McCarthy, while Hakeem Jeffries is widely expected to take the role of House Minority Leader, becoming the first black person in that role.3. Stocks set to rise; Gap beats quarterly expectationsU.S. stock markets are set to open higher Friday, as investors digest some positive retail earnings as well as hawkish comments from a number of Federal Reserve speakers.By 6:20 ET (11:20 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 145 points or 0.4%, while S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.6%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.8%.Retail chain Gap (NYSE:GPS) stock is seen with strong gains premarket after beating estimates for quarterly sales and profit after the close Thursday, helped by steady demand for its formal clothing and dresses from affluent consumers.Rival Macy's (NYSE:M) had also signaled strong demand for high-end apparel ahead of the holiday season earlier in the week.However, it wasn't all good news, as online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said late Thursday that its layoffs would extend into 2023, with reports suggesting the company is still targeting around 10,000 job cuts.Economic data centers around existing home sales, while Boston Fed President Susan Collins is scheduled to speak during the session.4. Thawing in U.S./Saudi Arabia relationsIn a sign of a possible thawing of relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, the Biden administration ruled on Thursday that Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has immunity from a lawsuit over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.President Joe Biden had previously promised to make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" over its human rights record, making it clear the killing in 2018 was ""vitally important to me and the United States.""Adding frost to the relationship had been the decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, to cut crude production to support oil prices last month, a move that sparked fierce criticism from Biden.Oil prices have fallen back this week on concerns that rising COVID cases in China, the world's largest importer of crude, will hit the demand recovery. However, they still remain at elevated levels, adding to global inflationary pressures.By 06:20 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $81.50 a barrel, down over 8% week-to-date, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $89.33, around 7% lower so far this week.5. Corporates looking for World Cup bounceThe FIFA World Cup kicks off this weekend, with many companies viewing the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world as central to their fortunes this quarter.Gambling firms, which are seeing a drop in online gaming from COVID peaks, are now staring at challenges from a cost-of-living crisis as customers seek to cut non-essential spending.Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), which is the official supplier of the FIFA World Cup, cut its 2022 outlook earlier this month but will be looking for a boost from the massive exposure such a tournament brings.Similarly, FIFA sponsor Budweiser, owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD), the world's largest brewer, will be hoping for a jump in sales. That said, FIFA has announced that fans will not be allowed to buy alcohol around World Cup stadiums in a dramatic reversal just two days before the soccer tournament starts.Related ArticlesFTX repercussions, Pelosi, Saudi relations thaw - what's moving marketsFord executive says South Africa needs EV policy within six monthsChile's GDP posts largest quarterly drop in over 2 years as recession fears grow]"

The company also announced a new restructuring plan as the economy slows. Cisco CFO Scott Herren rejoins us now. Scott, good to get some time with you again here. One thing I keep seeing in a lot of these analysts' notes out this morning is a decline in product orders. Take us through that decline. How concerned are you about that?SCOTT HERREN: Yeah, Brian, good to see you again as well. So we had a great start to the year. This was a record high revenue for us. It was the second highest quarter ever for earnings per share. Demand came down. Remember, when we talk about demand, product orders, right, that's comparing to a Q1 last year that grew 34%, right?So the year on year compares are skewed by the size of our product orders a year ago. The better way to think about it then is sequentially. What was Q4 to Q1, and how does that compare to a normal trend for us? It was within about a point of the historical range we've seen. So this was a good quarter. Demand is holding up for us.BRAD SMITH: So that is the big question. What does normalization look like for the business, especially as we think about pre-2019 levels and what the growth metrics were that you were looking at coming into the pandemic that you can start to see reemerge and kind of stabilize at this point?SCOTT HERREN: I see networking, security, and collaboration as being in significantly higher demand than they've been historically. Every adjusting to the new reality of work, right? It's not-- you don't come to the office to do your job anymore. You come to the office for different reasons, right? What that means is the office needs to be reconfigured. Part of the restructuring that we announced is about reconfiguring and taking down the amount of office space we have.Story continuesSo there's demand for networking in the office. Every home is like a branch office now, right? So you have to protect that. You have to get good networking there. Obviously, you need security around it. So the growth opportunity for us longer term-- we talked about this last year-- is somewhere in that 5% to 7% compound annual growth rate range.JULIE HYMAN: And can you talk us through a little bit more of the restructuring-- Scott, it's Julie here-- in terms of headcount, what effect it's going to have because it sounds like you're not-- that the headcount from, what, the beginning of the year to the end of the year is going to remain unchanged, but there's some movement within there. Can you explain that to us?SCOTT HERREN: Yeah, you said it exactly right. It's good to see you again, too, Julie. Yeah, I think what we're doing may be a little bit different than what you see from some others in the industry right now. There's two elements to the restructuring we announced. One is rightsizing your office space as I just talked about. We've got a lot of office space that is either unused or significantly underutilized. So there's a piece of it that's just rightsizing that leased office space.The second is we're constantly looking to invest in areas that drive faster growth, so the question that was just asked. As we do that, we want to focus more resources in areas around a single platform, single operating platform for our networking products, around more cloud delivered capability and around security. And so what we're doing is in order to add more resources into those areas is we're coming down in other areas.Our goal, by the way, will be to minimize the number of people who actually leave Cisco. In some cases, what we're looking to do is actually take the people that are in areas where we're going to reduce and place them into jobs in the other-- where we need to add more resources. So the goal will be to minimize the number who actually leave.And by the end of the year, we think our headcount is right about where it was at the beginning of the year. So this is not motivated by strictly trying to save costs. We didn't go through the huge buildup that I think a lot of companies did during the pandemic. So we're now at a point where we just have to reduce cost.BRAD SMITH: Scott, there could be existing or net new customers that you're having talks with, trying to upsell some of those portfolio clients, but also trying to get new contracts with some of those net new customers. Are you seeing a stalling in those deals actually being brought over the end zone, brought over the finish line, as companies are managing their own costs as well?SCOTT HERREN: Yeah, Brian it's hard to generalize to the entire world what we're seeing right now. It's a little bit different in Europe versus what we're seeing in APJ versus what we're seeing in the Americas. Europe has got its own set of issues, largely around energy and the rapidly increasing cost of energy, which, when you do what I do, and you've got a big piece of your cost structure that is-- that's very hard to predict, naturally, you start to put more focus on where can I save money.And so we're not seeing deals lost in Europe. But we are seeing a little more pressure in Europe and, in some cases, more approvals added to the end of that, a little more scrutiny on those deals. What we see across Asia is actually continued strength. Obviously, they have an eye on what's happening in the rest of the world. But for example, five of our seven theaters actually showed growth on top of what was a strong Q1 for them a year ago. So a little bit different in Asia.And then across the Americas, it varies a little bit by customer size. Enterprise continues to do quite well. Our US enterprise business, on top of a very strong growth a year ago, continued to show growth in the quarter we just closed. So it's a little bit different, Brian, by customer segment, a little bit different by where you are in the world.BRIAN SOZZI: Scott, in a period where you're now restructuring the business, and global growth around the world is slowing or just flat out slowed, what's the company's appetite to do acquisitions?SCOTT HERREN: We've always had a strategy around acquisitions. If you look at the amount of free cash flow we generate on an annual basis, the round number is 13 to 14 billion. A lot of that we return to shareholders. The dividend consumes about 6 and 1/2. Offsetting the dilution of our equity plans consumes another couple of million. That still leaves us with a significant amount of cash that we have to decide what's the best use of it. And acquisitions are a part of that. They have been historically.I would say, right now, it's a little bit difficult. The acquisition market-- you've seen it worldwide-- has slowed down. And it's a-- I don't think a lot of companies have adjusted to the new reality of valuations, is the first part. And then the second part is the cost of money is higher. While we generate a lot of cash, there's times where you can't actually access cash that you've got in different places around the world. And the cost of money is significantly higher now than it was, say, a year ago.JULIE HYMAN: Hey, Scott, finally, as you talk about decreasing your real estate footprint, you're also changing, it looks like. I have to admit, full disclosure, behind you is not what I would have expected a Cisco office to look like. That's what I would have expected, like--BRIAN SOZZI: A Yahoo office.JULIE HYMAN: Or like a startup office in Silicon Valley to look like. I mean, what-- is this what people can expect if they come and work at Cisco, that it's going to look like this?SCOTT HERREN: Julie, we need to bring you to our office in New York.JULIE HYMAN: Obviously.SCOTT HERREN: Next quarter, when we do this interview, we'll do it from our office at 1 Penn. This is what offices look like at Cisco, and this is what offices are going to look like for everyone. The reason to come to the office now, post-pandemic with hybrid work as a reality that everyone's adjusting to, is very different than it was historically. You come now for community. You come now to get together, as opposed to coming to set your laptop down and get your job done. If that's all you've got to do, you can do that from home.BRIAN SOZZI: Scott, let's get Yahoo Finance on that TV behind you. I see a plan. We'll take it offline, though.JULIE HYMAN: Uh-oh you're going to get an email from Sozz.BRIAN SOZZI: I'm actually sending it right now.JULIE HYMAN: But we'll leave that to you guys. Scott--SCOTT HERREN: All right.JULIE HYMAN: --thank you so much. It's good to catch up with you. Cisco CFO Scott Herren, appreciate it.]"
