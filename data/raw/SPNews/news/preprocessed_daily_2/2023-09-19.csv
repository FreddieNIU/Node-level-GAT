This makes these companies the best of the best when it comes to dividend durability.These companies have enduring business models and provide products or services that customers need, even in recessionary periods.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with HEPA. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?This discussion will examine two of the newest additions to the Dividend Kings that can be counted on for income over the long-term.Archer-Daniels-MidlandThe first name up for discussion is Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (NYSE:ADM). Founded in 1902, the company, which is also called ADM, has transformed over time to become an agricultural giant. The companys business segments provide processed cereal grains, oilseeds and storage and transportation. The company has a market capitalization of $43 billion and has generated almost $100 billion over the last year.Archer-Daniels-Midlands primary competitive advantage is it is the largest publicly traded farmland company in the country, giving it a size and scale that competitors have not been able to replicate. In addition, the need for food to meet growing populations remains very high, which has typically helped the company perform well during recessionary periods.The GF Score of 88 out of 100 suggests modest returns at the current price. The company scores well in the area profitability and growth and has average rankings for momentum, financial strength and value.2 Dividend Kings Providing Safe and Secure IncomeWhile many companies struggled during the 2007 to 2009 period, Archer-Daniels-Midlands earnings per share improved almost 29%. While the company did see declines in the middle of the last decade, earnings compounded at a rate of more than 14% for this period.Story continuesThis high rate of growth has enabled the company to raise its dividend for 50 consecutive years, making it one of the newest members of the Dividend King Index. Dividend growth has been solid since 2013, with distributions growing at an annual rate of 8.6%. Archer-Daniels-Midland yields 2.3% currently, which is ahead of the S&amp;P 500 Indexs average yield of 1.5%.A dividend growth streak means little if the dividend is not safe. This should be an issue for Archer-Daniels-Midland as its projected payout ratio for this year is just 25%. This compares favorably to the average payout ratio of 39% since 2013. This likely means the company can continue to raise its dividend for years to come.The stocks GF Value Line suggests the stock is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value, based on the companys historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts projections for future earnings growth. Archer-Daniels-Midland has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.91, implying a possible return of 9.9% return from current levels. Inclusive of the dividend yield, total returns could be in the double digits.2 Dividend Kings Providing Safe and Secure IncomeS&amp;P GlobalNext up is S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), which provides financial services and business information to customers around the world. The company was originally named McGraw Hill Financial, where is first introduced the S&amp;P 500 Index.The companys services include providing credit ratings, analytics and other data to market participants and capital markets. S&amp;P Global is valued at $123 billion and generates annual revenue of approximately $12 billion.S&amp;P Global has a diversified business model. Roughly two-thirds of revenue comes from the Americas, with Europe, the Middle East and Africa contributing 25% and Asia Pacific-China adding the remainder. Investment banking and management are the two largest contributors to sales, making up half of the annual total combined. The company operates in an environment with few large players as the top three names in the financial debt ratings industry control more than 90% of the market.The company receives has a solid GF Score of 94 from GuruFocus. This score implies high returns moving forward and is powered by high marks for profitability, momentum, growth and value. These scores are partially offset by a middle of the road result for financial strength.2 Dividend Kings Providing Safe and Secure IncomeThe company was not immune to the last recession, with earnings per share falling 21% from 2007 to 2009. However, S&amp;P Global did return to growth in 2010, establishing a new high for earnings per share in 2013. Earnings per share have a compound annual growth rate of 14.4% for the last decade.While bottom-line growth was sporadic during this period, S&amp;P Global continued to raise its dividend. In fact, the company has paid an uninterrupted dividend since 1937. The company has also raised its dividend for 50 consecutive years.Shares of S&amp;P Global yield just 0.9%. What the stock lacks in income it makes up for in dividend growth and safety. S&amp;P Globals dividend has a CAGR of nearly 13% over the last decade. The projected payout ratio for 2023 is just 29%, which compares favorably to the long-term average payout ratio of 27%.S&amp;P Globals GF Value Line implies shares are slightly undervalued. With a GF Value of 0.93, investors could see a 10% return from current levels.2 Dividend Kings Providing Safe and Secure IncomeFinal thoughtsInvestors looking for sources of safe and secure income are recommended to consider the Dividend Kings. These names have proven over a long period of time to have enduring business models that propel dividend growth.Archer-Daniels-Midland and S&amp;P Global are two of the newest members of the Dividend Kings. Both companies have strong business models and extensive track records for dividend growth, making each a good addition to an income orientated investors watchlist.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Whether it’s seeking out stocks with low share prices or solid growth potential, or following the market’s best dividend payers, some strategies come up over and over again.One of these common themes to is to follow the money, that is, to buy into cash-rich stocks. These will bring several advantages to the table, as their deep pockets will help to insulate them against economic shocks and give them the resources to withstand most headwinds. Additionally, many cash-rich stocks are also known for making generous capital returns to shareholders, through combinations of share buybacks and dividend payments.The stock analysts at Goldman Sachs are following this path, and seeing the US economy as currently in a slowdown phase, during which investors traditionally favor a safety-first approach, they have been pointing out deep-pocketed stocks that are offering total returns of at least 11%. These aren’t necessarily the biggest dividend payers – but their combinations of cash reserves, buybacks, and dividend payments give them total returns that will easily beat inflation and provide investors with a ‘place of safety’ as a possible recession looms on the horizon.We’ve opened up the TipRanks database, to pull the details on two of these Goldman picks. Let’s see just what these stocks have to offer and check out the comments from Goldman’s analysts.Tapestry, Inc. (TPR)The first stock we’re looking at, Tapestry, is based in New York. It’s a multinational holding company, and the owner of three well-known names in luxury fashion: Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman. Tapestry’s brands are operated as independent entities, although they share a common commitment to authenticity, excellence, and innovation. As a luxury retailer, Tapestry has a global reach. The company strives to turn its customer base into an empowered commercial community, and to turn the fashion industry toward sustainability.Story continuesIn August, Tapestry announced it had entered a definitive agreement to acquire Capri Holdings, a firm that, like Tapestry, is a parent company to three luxury fashion brands. The acquisition will bring Capri’s brands, Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors, under the Tapestry umbrella. Tapestry, the acquiring firm, will pay Capri’s shareholders $57 for each share, giving the transaction an approximate value of $8.5 billion.The Capri acquisition bodes well for Tapestry going forward, but in the recently reported fiscal 4Q23, the company missed quarterly expectations even as it completed a strong overall year. The 4Q revenue of $1.62 billion was flat year-over-year, and some $30 million below the forecasts; at the bottom line, EPS of 95 cents was up 20% y/y but was also 1-cent lower than had been expected.For 2023 as a whole, however, Tapestry reported some solid metrics. The full-year diluted EPS, based on a net income of $936 million, was $3.88 – up 22% y/y and a company record. And, during the year, Tapestry returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders.That shareholder return was supported by $791 million free cash flow, compared to $759 million in the prior year. Share repurchases totaled over $700 million in fiscal year 2023, and dividend payments came to more than $283 million. Going into fiscal 2024, the company has raised the quarterly dividend by 17%, to $0.35 quarterly or $1.40 annualized. Tapestry’s total return yield, taking the dividend and buybacks together, comes to ~13%.For Goldman’s Brooke Roach, despite the recent disappointing results, Tapestry’s combination of market position and solid management add up to a stock worth recommending. She writes of TPR, “We acknowledge the several headwinds in the quarter which were larger than our prior expectations (NA -8% Y/Y) as a result of weaker conversion trends for the value-oriented consumer. That said, we are encouraged by TPR’s actions to improve sales trends here, and management’s commentary regarding a significant QTD acceleration (now trending flat Y/Y). We continue to believe that TPR’s DTC positioning, globally diversified operating model, strong brand momentum at Coach, and execution of strategic initiatives will continue to drive relative outperformance against a choppy macro.”Looking ahead, Roach gives the shares a Buy rating and a $46 price target that implies a 50% potential gain in the next 12 months. (To watch Roach’s track record, click here.)Overall, Tapestry’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 17 recent analyst reviews, including 12 Buys and 5 Holds. The average price target stands at $46.81, suggesting a one-year upside potential of 52%. (See Tapestry’s stock forecast.)American International Group (AIG)American International Group, the second Goldman pick we’ll look at, is better known by its initials (and stock ticker), AIG. The company is a leading player in the global insurance industry, offering commercial and retail customers worldwide a full range of insurance products, including property casualty, life, liability, financial, and accident &amp; health policies, along with retirement solutions and other financial services. The business thrust is clear; AIG helps its customers protect their assets through risk management, while providing for future security.The insurance industry is well-known for generating high income, and AIG brought in an after-tax attributable income (AATI) of $1.3 billion in its last quarter, 2Q23. This compared favorably to the $1.1 billion AATI from the previous-year quarter. The resultant adj. EPS of $1.75, was up almost 26% y/y. The company attributed the increase to higher results in the life insurance and retirement segments of the business; a 9% reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding also contributed to the high EPS, which beat the forecasts by 17 cents per share.For return-minded investors, the key point here is that AIG returned some $822 million in capital to its shareholders during the second quarter of this year. The company did this through both a share repurchase policy and a common share dividend. On the first, AIG repurchased $554 million worth of common stock during the quarter; on the second, AIG paid out $268 million in dividends to common shareholders. The common stock dividend, at 36 cents per share, reflected a 12.5% increase in the payment, marking the first dividend increase since 2016. Between the dividend and the effects of share repurchases, AIG returns 11% to investors.The underlying strength of AIG attracted Goldman analyst Alex Scott to this stock. He points out that AIG is likely to continue its solid performance, and writes, “We remain optimistic that AIG will drive ROE expansion through underwriting improvement, greater underwriting leverage, expense reduction, capital management / share repurchases, and net investment income. We increasingly believe that our thesis around the ROE improvement and potential for this company to trade in excess of adjusted BVPS (book value per share) is very real. Ultimately, we think execution on all fronts of the company’s strategy likely yields an ROE more significantly in excess of 10% and with the help of higher interest rates persisting we think the company will get to a 10%+ ROE potentially quicker than we had anticipated.”Putting his stance into quantifiable terms, Scott rates these shares as a Buy, with an $81 price target to suggest 32% share appreciation over the coming year. (To watch Scott’s track record, click here.)Of the 11 recent analyst reviews on record for AIG, 7 are to Buy against 4 Holds – giving the shares a Moderate Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $70, and a trading price of $61.18, AIG can claim a one-year upside potential of 14%.

4,a38b6893-df9c-394a-beae-1df6ff4770a4,AMGN,2023-09-19,The 3 Most Undervalued Biotech Stocks to Buy in September 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-biotech-stocks-012252981.html,1694568172,STORY,"['PFE', 'AMGN', 'MRNA']","[It’s been a difficult time for biotechnology stocks. After a boom during the Covid-19 pandemic, the entire sector appears to have been abandoned by investors. The Standards and Practices (S&amp;P) 500 Biotechnology Select Industry Index has declined 11% throughout the past 12 months and is down 18% throughout the last five years. Companies large and small have seen their stock prices slump as investor confidence in the industry wanes. Of course, hurdles surrounding prescription drug makers and medical treatments are legendary. Having said that, there are still some undervalued biotech stocks that you should consider.Huge capital outlays, years of research, regulatory hurdles, rampant competition and the ever-present threat of losing patent exclusivity loom over the entire industry. This is leading many investors to steer clear of it altogether. However, there are some hidden gems to be found among biotech stocks. The downturn has left many companies with extremely attractive valuations. Here are the three most undervalued biotech stocks to buy in September 2023.Moderna (MRNA)Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comBiopharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) has suffered a big comedown throughout the last two years. The company’s share price is currently down 41% this year and 77% below its all-time high reached in September 2021. The company’s Covid-19 vaccine was one of the first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was a global hit and generated sales of $18.4 billion last year, but those sales are projected to fall to $5 billion this year. This is sending MRNA stock sharply lower as a result.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe other issue pulling MRNA stock lower is the fact that its pipeline has not produced any other commercially available medications. While the company has several new prescription drugs in development, its Covid-19 vaccine is currently the only product generating any revenue. However, there is some hope of an upsurge in Covid-19 vaccine sales this fall and winter. This is particularly true as people get boosted against the respiratory illness. Moderna currently has $14.6 billion of cash on its balance sheet, putting it in a strong position.Story continuesAmgen (AMGN)Source: ShutterstockShares of Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) have generated no gains this year. The company’s stock is up less than 1% since January. Over five years, the shares have risen a middling 30%. It is trading at 17 times future earnings and is offering shareholders a quarterly dividend of $2.13 per share, for a yield of 3.25%. AMGN stock looks undervalued at current levels. Amgen specializes in medications that treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and drugs that prevent infections. Amgen is one of the biggest independent biotech companies in the world.The stock has been held back by its $27.8 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP). This deal will give Amgen access to blockbuster medications such as thyroid eye disease treatment Tepezza and gout drug Krystexxa. However, this has drawn close scrutiny from regulators. Once the Horizon takeover is completed, it should provide Amgen with plenty of growth opportunities and light a fuse under the share price. Amgen also has a strong pipeline with more than 40 products in differing stages of clinical development. This is one of the most undervalued biotech stocks.Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comShares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) looks dirt cheap right now. The biotech company’s stock is currently sitting at a 52-week low and down 34% year to date. Through five years, the share price has declined 17%. Right now, PFE stock is trading at a rock bottom nine times future earnings, and it provides a dividend of 41 cents a share, for a yield of nearly 5%. Among biotechnology companies, few if any look as undervalued as Pfizer, whose share price has crumbled following its second-quarter financial results being made public.For Q2 of this year, Pfizer reported a 54% year-over-year decline in its revenue due mainly to dwindling sales of its Covid-19 vaccine. Sales of Pfizer’s Covid-19 shot fell 83% to $1.49 billion during Q2. The company said it is in a “transition period” as it navigates its post-pandemic sales boom, and said it is considering widespread cost cuts in the coming months. However, Pfizer too has other commercial products and a strong pipeline of new medications that it says should help it find new areas for growth.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

10,d337c057-348a-3c36-8ba7-a84ac87586e1,AES,2023-09-19,AES (NYSE:AES) Has More To Do To Multiply In Value Going Forward,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aes-nyse-aes-more-multiply-123025162.html,1695040225,STORY,['AESC'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think AES (NYSE:AES) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on AES is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.068 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$42b - US$7.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, AES has an ROCE of 6.8%. In absolute terms, that's a low return, but it's much better than the Renewable Energy industry average of 2.7%. View our latest analysis for AES roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for AES compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering AES here  for free.So How Is AES' ROCE Trending?Over the past five years, AES' ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at AES in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why AES is paying out 35% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On AES' ROCEIn a nutshell, AES has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Since the stock has gained an impressive 45% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Like most companies, AES does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ADI) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Analog DevicesThe Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology, Vivek Jain, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.9m worth of shares at a price of US$176 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$180). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was 59% of Vivek Jain's holding.In total, Analog Devices insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. They sold for an average price of about US$182. It's not particularly great to see insiders were selling shares at below recent prices. Since insiders sell for many reasons, we wouldn't put too much weight on it. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!Story continuesinsider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Analog Devices insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$319m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Analog Devices Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Analog Devices insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Analog Devices has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.Have feedback on this article?

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Amphenol (NYSE:APH). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Amphenol How Quickly Is Amphenol Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Amphenol has managed to grow EPS by 20% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Amphenol remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 5.3% to US$13b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Amphenol's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Amphenol Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$51b company like Amphenol. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$305m. We note that this amounts to 0.6% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Amphenol but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Amphenol Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Amphenol has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Amphenol's continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of Amphenol.Although Amphenol certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

To see more such funds, go directly to 5 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for Retirees.As millions of Americans approach retirement age, retirement planning is taking on ever greater significance. Every year, a substantial number of Baby Boomers retire, and concurrently, millennials are becoming more engaged in considering their own retirement. After all, the main income source for the majority of individuals is their job. Unless they possess substantial inheritance, it's essential to commence retirement planning right from the outset of their professional journey. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)'s Modern Wealth Survey, Americans now consider a minimum of $2.2 million as the threshold for wealth, surpassing the previous benchmark of $1 million. This same trend extends to retirement, where the target for a comfortable retirement has shifted from $1 million to $1.25 million over the years.Throughout 2021, the economy grappled with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite efforts to bounce back, various notable challenges cast uncertainty over the recovery. Inflation surged to levels not witnessed for many years, supply-chain disruptions tempered economic expansion, and a constrained labor market posed ongoing challenges for employers, exacerbated by a record number of employees either transitioning to new roles or exiting the workforce altogether. Another result of the COVID-19 pandemic's emergence was the increasing popularity of retirement among Americans. According to a New York Times report, many millennial workers aspire to retire in their 50s to pursue their personal interests. However, their financial circumstances appear to tell a different story. The report cited findings from Willis Towers Watson's Global Benefits Attitudes Survey, indicating that 36% of millennial workers in a broad range of industries were saving a mere 5% of their income, a sum insufficient to cover their living expenses during retirement. However, 52% of the respondents said they expected to retire before 65. The 2022 TIAA Retirement Insights Survey echoed these sentiments, reporting that 31 percent of individuals aged 30 to 39 expressed above-average confidence in their retirement planning capabilities. Among the younger millennial cohort, aged 25 to 29, confidence was even higher, with 40 percent believing they had an above-average level of competence in retirement planning.Story continuesHowever, despite this confidence, several Americans are falling short in their savings efforts, and a significant portion is failing to contribute enough to their 401(k) plans to receive the full employer match. According to a recent survey conducted by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute, 64% of working individuals surveyed expressed confidence in their financial outlook for retirement. This represents a decrease from the 73% reported the previous year. Notably, only 18% of those surveyed expressed being ""very confident"" this year, down from the 30% reported in the previous year.Vanguard's How American Saves 2022 report provides insight on how Americans are building their retirement savings. In recent years, automatic savings features have seen a significant surge in popularity. By the close of 2021, 56% of Vanguard plans had embraced automatic enrollment, a trend especially notable in plans with over 1,000 participants, where 75% had adopted this approach. Additionally, Americans are increasingly favoring professionally managed accounts and services as they plan for retirement. By the end of 2021, an impressive 64% of all Vanguard participants had placed their investments solely in automatic investment programs, marking a substantial increase from the 7% reported at the end of 2004. Vanguard presents a range of target-date retirement funds, some of which are featured in our list. These funds have been steadily gaining traction. According to a Vanguard report, 56% of their participants had invested in a single target-date fund. Reflecting their growing appeal, the availability of target-date funds in plans increased to 95% by the end of 2021, compared to 84% in 2012.In spite of the aforementioned data, the United States boasts a thriving and robust retirement industry. According to McKinsey, the U.S. retirement market possesses an impressive $26 trillion in assets. This data unveils a remarkable forecast: by 2030, retirees are anticipated to make a greater contribution to global consumption than individuals in the working age range of 15 to 59 years in China. The research conducted by McKinsey reveals that Defined Contribution, the largest segment within the retirement industry, constitutes approximately 30% of the total assets, totaling around $8 trillion. These assets generate an impressive $30 billion in revenue for the managing firms, overseeing approximately 110 million accounts. Notably, the Defined Contribution industry has displayed consistent growth over the last decade.Lastly, a significant aspect of retirement pertains to the assisted living community sector, also referred to as old age homes. These establishments provide seniors with companionship and care during the latter phases of their lives. As outlined in a research report by Grand View Market Research, the assisted living industry was valued at approximately $91.8 billion in 2022, and is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.53% from 2023 to 2030. Within the market, the segment catering to individuals aged 85 and above claimed the largest market share in 2022. Looking ahead to 2040, the number of seniors in this age group is projected to more than double, increasing from 6.4 million in 2016 to an estimated 14.6 million.11 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for RetireesPhoto by Diana Parkhouse on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we thoroughly examined Vanguard's selection of retirement-oriented funds and curated a list of 11 funds that are highly regarded for their safety and popularity among retirement experts and market analysts. The goal of this compilation is to offer a comprehensive selection of well-regarded funds listed on US exchanges. Furthermore, we have highlighted the top holdings of these ETFs, wherever applicable, which include prominent companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), to provide deeper insights for potential investors. Lastly, these Vanguard ETFs have demonstrated remarkable growth over the past five years. The list is organized in ascending order based on their five-year performance as of September 14, 2023.11. Vanguard Growth and Income Fund (MUTF:VQNPX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 6.39%Positioned perfectly between income and growth, the Vanguard Growth and Income Fund (MUTF:VQNPX) aims to surpass the S&amp;Ps 500 Index, making it an attractive option for investors seeking both dividend income and potential stock price appreciation. Investors will gain exposure to leading stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B).10. Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (MUTF:VSVNX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 12.55%Target-date funds like Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (MUTF:VSVNX) have been tailored with long-term investors in mind as they prepare for retirement. VSVNX, designed for young investors eyeing retirement around 2070, boasts a modest 0.08% expense ratio, translating to an annual fee of $8 on a $10,000 investment. This fund's primary objective is to achieve capital growth and current income in line with its current target allocation. It accomplishes this by gradually shifting its investments into a more conservative blend of Vanguard funds, including the Total Stock Market Index Fund, Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Total International Stock Index Fund, Total International Bond II Index Fund, and Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Fund.9. Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund (MUTF:VASGX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 13.50%The Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund (MUTF:VASGX) is an excellent choice for younger investors who are comfortable with greater risk. This LifeStrategy fund is geared toward achieving long-term capital growth and maintains a fixed asset allocation, with roughly 80% invested in global stocks and 20% in global bonds. It's worth noting that VASGX does carry a slightly higher expense ratio of 0.14% in comparison to target-date funds and has a minimum investment requirement of $3,000.8. Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (NASDAQ:VTTSX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 21.02%Instead of fixating on a specific retirement year, Vanguard adopts a five-year timeframe – for instance, 2056 to 2060 in the instance of VTTSX. This approach renders the fund well-suited for a more adaptable retirement planning approach. As the target retirement date for each fund draws nearer, VTTSX offers investors diversification along with a gradual reduction in stock exposure and a corresponding increase in bond exposure.7. Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VT)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 27.34%The Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VT) stands out as a top Vanguard retirement fund due to its comprehensive coverage of both developed and emerging markets. It is particularly appealing to investors seeking ETFs with minimal expense ratios, with the fund's expense ratio standing at just 0.07% as of February. Noteworthy among the ETF's holdings are significant companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).6. Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VIMAX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 29.75%Opting for Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VIMAX) is a strong choice for bolstering the mid-cap stock segment of your investment portfolio, especially if you're aiming to expand your holdings across a broader spectrum of equities. According to an S&amp;P Global report, mid-cap stocks consistently outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 for most of the 20-year period concluding on August 31, 2015.

A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.

Rising debts remain a concern as it leads to escalated interest expenses.Dull Mineral Nutrition Arm, Macro Woes Hurt Phibro (PAHC)The Zacks analyst is concerned about the lower-than-expected demand for Phibro's Mineral Nutrition products dampening the core segment's performance.

Robinson Worldwide and Matson",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-expeditors-115600407.html,1695038160,STORY,"['CHRW', 'EXPD', 'MATX', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 18, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Expeditors International of Washington EXPD, C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW and Matson MATX.Industry: Transportation ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2149441/3-transport-service-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-concernsThe Zacks Transportation-Services  industry faces challenges, ranging from high inflation-induced elevated interest rates, weak freight rates, high costs and supply-chain disruptions.Despite the challenges, we believe that stocks like Expeditors International of Washington, C.H. Robinson Worldwide and Matson should be on an investor's watchlist despite the improvement in the demand scenario from the pandemic lows.About the IndustryThe companies belonging to the Zacks Transportation-Services industry offer transporters logistics, leasing and maintenance services. Some industry players focus on the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding. Third-party logistics entities provide innovative supply-chain solutions. They also focus on services like product sourcing, warehousing and freight shipping. The companies have expertise in trucking, air and ocean transportation.Additionally, some players in this industry deliver domestic and international express delivery services. The well-being of the companies in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the economy's health. An uptick in manufactured and retail goods, favorable pricing and improvement in global economic conditions bode well for the industry participants.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Transportation-Services IndustrySupply-Chain Disruptions &amp; Weak Freight Rates: Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Below-par freight rates are also hurting the industry's prospects. Highlighting the weak freight demand, the Cass Freight shipments Index declined 2.2% month on month in July. This measure has deteriorated month on month in five of the seven months reported this year, confirming the overall declining trend.Story continuesStrong Financial Returns for Shareholders: With economic activities gaining pace from the pandemic lows, more and more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile through dividends and buybacks to pacify long-suffering shareholders. This underlines their financial strength and business confidence. Among the Transportation - Services industry players, Matson announced a 3.2% increase in the quarterly dividend in June.Economic Uncertainty: Most companies in the industry are experiencing rising costs in the form of increased expenses. The inflationary environment, together with supply-chain tightness, is not only pushing costs higher but also affecting capital programs. The sharp rise in oil prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended voluntary supply cuts has also contributed to the recent downtrend in U.S. equity markets. This may lead to a rough road for the Transport- Service providers.Focus on Cost-Cuts to Drive Bottom Line: Despite signs of cooling inflation, we are not out of the woods. In fact, with inflation still well above the Fed's 2% target, more interest rate hikes in the near term cannot be ruled out. We note that the industry has been experiencing significant levels of inflation, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The industry players are focusing on cost-cutting measures and improving productivity and efficiency to mitigate high expenses and weaker-than-expected demand scenarios.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Transportation - Services industry is a 26-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation  sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183, which places it in the bottom 27% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate for 2023 has decreased 2.7% since February-end.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Lags Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Transportation-Services industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has inched up 0.4% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's appreciation of 14.8% and the broader sector's uptick of 1.6%.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-sales, a commonly used multiple for valuing Transportation-services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 2.1X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.71X. The value is, however, higher than the sector's trailing 12-month P/S of 1.58X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.43X, as low as 1.55X and at the median of 1.97X.3 Transport Services Stocks to WatchMatson: This Honolulu, Hawaii- based provider of ocean transportation and logistics services currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We are impressed by the cost-management actions taken by the company to drive its bottom line.

EXPD's liquidity position is encouraging too.EXPD has outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other two). The stock has gained 11.2% over the past six months.C.H. Robinson Worldwide, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, operates as an asset-light logistics player. Efforts to control costs bode well for this freight broker. Measures to reward CHRW's shareholders instill further confidence in the stock. CHRW's liquidity position is encouraging too.In September, C.H. Robinson opened a new facility to speed up trade across the Mexico border to meet buoyant demand for border logistics facilities owing to nearshoring expansion. This has soared since 2020, boosted by declining U.S.-China trade relations and shifting global supply chains caused by the pandemic.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This advice comes as part of a balanced portfolio approach that involves a combination of defensive growth sectors and late-cycle cyclicals.Wilson's strategy suggests that investors should maintain a balanced portfolio until more concrete economic data is available. The approach includes sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples, known for their defensive growth, coupled with late-cycle cyclicals like industrials and energy. Despite the underperformance of these sectors this year, Wilson emphasizes that it's premature to shift investments towards small and mid-cap stocks. This is evident from the mere 4% rise in the Russell 2000 RUT in 2023.The energy sector has become an area of interest for investors due to rising crude oil prices, which recently neared $92 per barrel. Wilson identifies this sector as a frequent late-cycle performer, often driven by the strength of commodities. Factors such as robust oil demand, significant production reductions, and steady crude prices are seen as enhancing the sector's performance.This appeal of the energy sector is further underscored by its recovery from a period of underperformance that lasted from November of the previous year to July of this year. Currently, the sector offers attractive valuations and increased earnings revisions. It also generates substantial free cash flow and has the ability to repay debt if necessary. This resurgence occurs at a time when hedge fund exposure to the energy sector is unusually low.Wilson highlighted several defensive growth stocks that have outperformed both annually and more recently. These stocks include NYSE:ACN Accenture (NYSE:ACN), NASDAQ:AAPL Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NYSE:AZO AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), Biomarin Pharmaceutical BMRN, and NYSE:BSX Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX). All these stocks are rated overweight by Morgan Stanley.Story continuesMost U.S. investors expect that large-cap winners will continue to dominate in the fourth quarter, provided the broader market remains stable. Wilson noted similar concerns among European and U.S. clients regarding the current stage of the economic cycle and performance disparities.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

28,a90447f4-d521-3f41-90bd-a3c69ee25542,ADP,2023-09-19,20 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-best-citizenship-investment-programs-145406831.html,1695048846,STORY,"['BR', 'INTU', 'ADP']","[This article will explore the 20 best Citizenship by Investment programs in 2023. You can skip our comprehensive analysis and proceed directly to the 5 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 2023.Over the past decade, individuals with net worth ranging from $2 million to over $50 million have progressively gravitated towards Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programs. Motivated by aspirations for improved mobility, advantageous tax arrangements, and an elevated lifestyle encompassing better education and expanded civil liberties, these programs have surged in popularity.By introducing CBI programs, several smaller countries have strengthened their financial independence and improved their sovereign equity, thereby reducing public debt and reliance on debt financing from supranational organizations.The Allure of Investment Immigration: Embracing Global ProspectsThis rise in interest towards acquiring second citizenship or an alternate nationality holds particular allure for entrepreneurs, especially those classified as High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs). Such a venture opens the gateway to previously untapped business prospects, providing access to emerging markets and highly lucrative opportunities. By exploring these thriving industries and fostering global connections, entrepreneurs can substantially bolster the resilience and prosperity of their ventures.As reported by Investment Migration Council, in 2020, a historical high of 6,705 Americans chose to renounce their citizenship, but this figure notably decreased to 2,426 in 2022. The decline in numbers might partially be attributed to the closure of U.S. embassies during the pandemic. According to a survey conducted by Greenback Expat Tax Services, which polled U.S. expatriates residing in 121 countries, approximately 1 out of every 4 American expatriates is contemplating or actively planning to relinquish their U.S. citizenship. Critics of American tax legislation argue that the country's global income tax compliance and disclosure regulations are excessively burdensome and restrictive.Story continuesWith investors increasingly recognizing the value and potential benefits of a diversified passport portfolio, governments of countries offering investment migration programs also acknowledge the significance of customized immigration policies in attracting investors.On August 15, Bloomberg reported that the European countries offering golden visas have collectively attracted approximately €25 billion (equivalent to $27.1 billion) in foreign direct investment through these schemes over the last ten years. Portugal has stood out as a significant recipient, securing around €6.8 billion (equivalent to $7.3 billion) during this period.HNWI's Preferred Destinations: Tax HavensMany countries with CBI programs provide tax-friendly environments, featuring low or zero-tax regimes for foreign-sourced income, capital gains, and other financial gains. HNWIs can leverage these tax advantages to optimize their global tax position, reducing their tax liabilities significantly. Moreover, some countries grant tax exemptions or reduced personal income tax rates to their new citizens, providing substantial tax savings.Additionally, becoming a citizen of a tax-efficient country can lead to exemptions from wealth and inheritance taxes, preserving family wealth for future generations. Individuals can avoid double taxation and create a financially advantageous global lifestyle by strategically utilizing dual citizenship and tax treaties between nations.Given the substantial wealth and strategic business relocations undertaken by HNWIs and entrepreneurs via CBI programs, several companies specialize in providing bespoke solutions and navigating tax intricacies. Distinguished companies acclaimed for their services include Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), and Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR).Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a leading financial technology company renowned for its diverse financial products and services, including TurboTax, QuickBooks, and Mint. The financial tools provided by Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) serve as invaluable aids in managing complexities for businesses, HNWIs, and entrepreneurs alike. On September 13, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) introduced QuickBooks Money, a comprehensive payments and banking solution. This new offering does not impose any monthly fees or minimum balance requirements, providing small businesses with full control over their finances from any location. QuickBooks Money builds upon QuickBooks' previous financial technology innovations, delivering robust payment and money management features to small businesses through a simplified mobile and web-enabled experience, all without requiring a subscription.Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) provides human resources management and payroll services, including tax-related services.  Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) simplifies HR, payroll, and taxes, benefiting enterprises and HNWIs. On August 3, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) successfully acquired Honu HR, Inc., doing business as Sora (Sora). Sora is a low-code intelligent workflow automation and data integration solution designed to streamline various business applications, including HR and IT systems, to deliver a more efficient and user-friendly experience for employees, business owners, and HR professionals.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) offers investor communication and technology-driven solutions for financial services firms, including tax reporting services.  Leveraging its communication technology expertise, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) offers crucial tax reporting services for financial firms, HNWIs, and entrepreneurs. On September 14, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: BR) unveiled BRx Match, an all-encompassing cloud-based reconciliation and matching solution. BRx Match has been created to serve as a comprehensive reconciliation platform, capable of addressing both intricate and straightforward reconciliation tasks, thereby empowering business users with the capabilities of an enterprise-level reconciliation solution. This platform streamlines the entire reconciliation process, starting from its earliest stages, leading to enhanced efficiency, transparency, and accuracy, all while mitigating risks and reducing the total cost of ownership.Now that we have taken a look at some major companies that are providing tax and related services for entrepreneurs and high net worth individuals, let's take a look at some of the best Citizenship by Investment programs in 2023.20 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 2023Copyright: sidelnikov / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyWe determined the 20 best Citizenship by Investment programs in 2023 by evaluating several pivotal criteria of each country: affordability ranking that we gathered from our article (the information provided pertained to the top 15 programs, and we conducted separate research for the remaining 5 programs), tax advantages, political stability, government effectiveness index, and human development insight values.We analyzed data from Trading Economics and KPMG to assess tax friendliness, factoring in personal income tax percentages. Vanuatu and Cape Verde were not included in these lists, so we conducted independent research. The country with the lowest tax rate was assigned the highest rank.In a similar vein, political stability and government effectiveness rankings were informed by The World Bank index, while human development values drew from the United Nations Development Program index. This data was instrumental in crafting our distinct ranking score against each metric.Subsequently, we determined the best Citizenship by Investment programs in 2023 by averaging their placements on these indexes, with a lower average score signifying a more favorable ranking.Please Note:Cape Verde utilizes a progressive personal income tax structure, ranging from 16.5% to 27.5%. We ranked it by calculating its average rate.In cases where multiple countries had similar average scores, their ranking was determined by their tax friendliness score as a decisive factor.We consulted various sources such as Premier Consultancy Group, Global Citizen Solution, IMI Daily, Nomad Capitalist, Immigrant Invest, and Best Citizenships to ascertain investment costs.20 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 202320.

In 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission, the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act, completed six years of environmental review, certified a Final Environmental Impact Report, and issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the project.The County subsequently relied on the CPUC’s certified EIR in issuing its permit. Marina Coast Water District (MCWD) filed suit in Monterey Superior Court against the County and California American Water, alleging that additional environmental review was required. On April 29th, 2021 the trial court dismissed some of the claims made by MCWD but ruled in favor of MCWD on one limited challenge. The trial court’s decision was appealed by the County and California American Water. The Appellate Court’s September 9th, 2023 ruling reverses the judgement of the lower court and requires a new judgement rejecting all of MCWD’s claims in their entirety. It also requires MCWD to pay the legal costs incurred by the County and California American Water.In its decision, the Court of Appeal stated that: ""On the County and Cal-Am’s appeal, we conclude that the County’s statement of overriding considerations was supported by substantial evidence and any remaining deficiency in the statement as an informational document was not prejudicial. On MCWD’s cross-appeal, we are not persuaded that the trial court erred in rejecting MCWD’s other contentions. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment.""""This ruling is a victory for a sustainable water future for our region,"" said Josh Stratton, California American Water External Affairs Manager. ""We are diligently advancing our efforts to protect the Carmel River by working with our partners on new supplies for the Monterey Peninsula and desalination is key part of our future water resources.""Story continuesThe desalination plant is one of three major components that California American Water – the Peninsula’s water provider – has supported to diversify the area’s water supply and relieve the over-drafted Carmel River aquifer. The other two components of the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project are aquifer storage and recovery and a groundwater replenishment and recycled water project that together with other smaller projects will bring drought-proof and environmentally sustainable water supplies to the Monterey Peninsula.About California American Water:California American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), provides high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to more than 725,000 people.

36,4872a0c4-e7be-3039-8f24-a0ceeadd6274,LNT,2023-09-19,Estimating The Fair Value Of Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:LNT),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-alliant-energy-124430863.html,1695041070,STORY,['LNT'],"[Key InsightsAlliant Energy's estimated fair value is US$49.55 based on Dividend Discount ModelCurrent share price of US$51.78 suggests Alliant Energy is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$55.00 analyst price target for LNT is 11% more than our estimate of fair valueDoes the September share price for Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:LNT) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Alliant Energy The ModelAs Alliant Energy operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$51.8, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$2.0 / (6.2% – 2.2%)= US$49.6dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alliant Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Alliant EnergyStrengthNo major strengths identified for LNT.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.
