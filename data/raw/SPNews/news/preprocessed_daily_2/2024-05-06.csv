According to ISS, Denny’s has used exceptions in its language to “significantly weaken” transparency around its commitment to phase out gestation crates from its supply chain.', 'Known for its inexpensive breakfast menu, Denny’s in 2012 pledged to eliminate from its pork supply chain the use of gestation crates, which the Humane Society describes as solitary cages that “confine pigs so restrictively, they can’t even turn around.”', 'But over the next decade, Denny’s reported no “meaningful progress” and made no targets for achieving its goal, putting it at odds with other chains, according to the Humane Society’s shareholder proposal. “We think it’s time shareholders step in.”', 'In contrast, competitor Cheesecake Factory disclosed that 73 percent of its pork was gestation crate-free at the end of 2023, and that it plans to eliminate crates from its supply chain by 2025. The company did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Denny’s board recommended in an April 4 proxy filing that shareholders vote against the proposal, saying that its requirements would be redundant, unnecessary and inefficient. “Unfortunately the pork supply industry has not evolved as expected,"" it said.', 'In an April 19 statement to Reuters, Denny’s said reducing gestation crates is a “complex challenge within our industry,” but that it acknowledges “the importance of progressing towards more humane practices.”', 'Walmart shareholders also will be asked to vote on a similar proposal at its upcoming annual meeting. Walmart recommended that its shareholders vote against the proposal, which it said was unnecessary. ""The market does not currently support a speedy transition away from the use of gestation crates,"" the retailer said in its April 25 proxy filing.', 'McDonald’s two years ago faced pressure from billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn to fully eliminate gestation crates from its pork supply chain. He lost his battle to win board seats and shine a light on animal welfare. McDonald’s did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Denny’s, which had roughly 1,631 locations at the end of 2023, previously sought to avoid a similar shareholder proposal from the Humane Society from appearing before investors. A Denny’s executive hammered out a deal with the group in private, according to emails reviewed by Reuters.', 'In exchange for the Humane Society’s withdrawal of the 2022 proposal, Denny’s published language on its website disclosing that roughly a third of its pork came from suppliers that at least limit the use of gestation crates. Denny’s also weakened its pledge from eliminating gestation crates to allowing suppliers to use them before pigs are confirmed as pregnant, which according to veterinary experts can take several weeks.', 'Steve Meyer, a consulting economist for the National Pork Board and the National Pork Producers Council, said converting from gestation crates to open pens is a significant investment for pork farmers, but restaurant chains can get gestation-crate-free pork if they are willing to pay more for it.', 'Panera Bread in 2022 estimated it could save $3 million by removing its commitment to suppliers that limit the use of gestation crates, but did not choose to do so, according to internal documents reviewed by Reuters.', 'Denny’s amended its website’s language again following the 2024 Humane Society proposal to now read that it believes half of its pork could come from suppliers that limit gestation crates by 2028.

I say ""cosmetically,"" because stock splits don\'t alter a company\'s market cap or operating performance.', 'Most investors tend to focus on forward-stock splits, which are designed to reduce the nominal share price of a publicly traded company to make it more affordable for those without access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Since the midpoint of 2021, nearly a dozen high-profile businesses have conducted a forward-stock split, including AI kingpin Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).', 'However, Wall Street\'s brightest minds aren\'t necessarily enamored with the ""infrastructure backbone"" of the artificial intelligence revolution. During the December-ended quarter, billionaires were active sellers of Nvidia stock and piled into two recent stock-split stocks instead.', ""Shares of Nvidia have catapulted higher by nearly 470% since the start of 2023. The clear-cut catalyst behind its outperformance is its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which are what power AI-accelerated data centers. In particular, Nvidia's H100 GPU is responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions."", 'With its chips in high demand, Nvidia has enjoyed jaw-dropping GPU pricing power. Data Center segment sales jumped by 217% in fiscal 2024 (ended January 28), while cost of revenue across all of its segments rose by a far more modest 43%.', ""Despite these advantages, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective fund's stakes in Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):"", 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares)', 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares)', 'David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares)', 'Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares)', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares)', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)', ""The scarcity of Nvidia's GPUs is the primary reason its Data Center sales more than tripled last year. With the company increasing its production of H100 GPUs, and new companies entering the playing field, GPU scarcity is going to be less of a talking point by the latter-half of this year. Billionaires sending Nvidia to the chopping block may be rightly anticipating a drop-off in the company's pricing power and gross margin."", 'In addition to an increase in external competition, Nvidia could face immense challenges from internal competitors. Four ""Magnificent Seven"" components account for roughly 40% of Nvidia\'s net sales. Unfortunately, all four of these industry leaders are developing in-house GPUs of their own. There\'s a real possibility Nvidia\'s orders from its top customers taper off significantly in the coming years.', ""History might be the other big catalyst that created a billionaire exodus from Nvidia in the December-ended quarter. There hasn't been a next-big-thing investment or innovation in three decades that didn't endure an early stage bubble. Investors commonly overestimate the adoption and uptake of new technology, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to break that trend."", 'But while these eight billionaires were busy dumping shares of Nvidia, quite a few were piling into two outperforming stock-split stocks.', 'The first stock-split that was a favorite among billionaire investors during the fourth quarter is retail juggernaut Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Walmart effected a 3-for-1 forward split in late February.', 'All told, five of the prominent billionaires who sold Nvidia stock were buyers of Walmart shares, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,416,174 shares)', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (540,004 shares)', 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (261,294 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (150,570 shares)', ""From an investment standpoint, the lure of putting your money to work in Walmart has long been its size. It's a company with deep pockets that's able to purchase products in bulk. A lower per-unit price for most of its goods allows Walmart to undercut traditional grocers and local mom-and-pop shops on price."", ""To add to the above, the vastness of the products Walmart carries in its stores is rivaled by only a few competitors. Walmart has evolved into a one-stop shopping experience for consumers looking for a good deal. With the prevailing rate of inflation creeping back up, Walmart is just the type of business we'd expect to benefit."", ""Another reason investors tend to put their trust in Walmart stock over the long run is because it's a consumer staples company.

Today, Dustin and I will review SEE's financial performance, provide updates on the markets we serve, discuss relevant trends and highlight the significant progress made on the transformational actions discussed on our previous calls. Lastly, we will conclude with our 2024 outlook before opening the call for questions. We closed the quarter with sales of $1.33 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $278 million, delivering strong results despite the continued challenging market dynamics in the Protective segment. Our first quarter results reflected for the first time since quarter four 2021 year-over-year volume growth across all regions of our Food business, continued volume stabilization in Protective and strong execution related to our CTO2Grow initiatives."", 'Through the focused efforts of our teams around the world, we delivered positive free cash flow of $78 million in the first quarter compared with a negative $13 million in the same period a year ago. Dustin will provide a more comprehensive overview of our financial performance shortly. Now let us move on to our market and business update. During the first quarter, our Food segment delivered low single-digit volume growth across all regions, primarily driven by our shrink bag business, which benefited from the carryover momentum of enhanced holiday demand and new customer wins from the fourth quarter. In the U.S., beef production was down low single digits year-over-year for the first quarter. For the rest of 2024, U.S. slaughter rates are expected to decline at a more rapid pace in the outlining quarters.', 'In South America and Australia, cattle cycles are at their peaks, driven by a robust domestic consumption and heightened export activities. Against a flat global proteins market in the first quarter, we drove volume growth, gained share and delivered double-digit growth in automation. Following its successful launch last quarter, our new compostable tray continues to gain traction in the market. Additionally, we are actively engaged in the development and introduction of more sustainable packaging solutions, such as recycle-ready barrier display films, poultry bags and post-consumer-recycled trays to address evolving market needs and support food processors and retailers in meeting their sustainability goals and regulatory requirements. The regulatory landscape concerning plastics continues to evolve rapidly with recent legislative attention being directed towards polyvinylidene chloride or PVdC due to chemical similarity to PVC.', ""PVdC is used as a very thin barrier layer in multilayer films within our protein shrink bags. Our shrink bag business that contains PVdC is approximately 1/3 of our Food segment. This barrier material plays a vital role in preserving the quality of fresh proteins, extending shelf life, enabling global distribution and minimizing food waste and its environmental impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, there is no alternative to PVdC that matches its performance level. Through close collaboration with our suppliers, customers, industry associations and government agencies, we actively advocate for the essential role packaging plays in mitigating food waste and ensuring safe, affordable food on a global scale. For decades, we've been assisting our customers in adapting to the changing regulatory environment and safeguarding their food supply chains."", ""We already provide alternative barrier layers to PVdC, such as EVOH among others, particularly for applications with lower performance requirements. As the market leader in shrink bags, we continue to be best positioned to help food processors navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and deliver market-leading solutions that combine world-class material science, equipment and technical services. Transitioning to Protective. Revenue performance in the first quarter was in line with expectations. Industrial portfolios continued to be under pressure across all regions, contributing to a low to mid-single-digit year-over-year volume decline for the segment. As discussed on our last quarter's call, the pricing environment remains pressured as we compete in a low volume, low visibility environment."", ""In the Americas, volume growth was less than 1% as growth in box rightsizing solutions and recovery in retailer fulfillment sectors were offset by industrial weakness. EMEA experienced continued double-digit volume decline, primarily driven by intensified sustainability pressures across all portfolios and destocking from our APS product line. The electronics sector in Asia is improving from last year. However, uncertainties around China's economic recovery continue to temper short-term regional growth expectations. Consistent with our previous discussions, we still anticipate an L-shaped recovery across the Protective segment. The organizational changes implemented in February, which established dedicated commercial teams for both Food and Protective, are beginning to gain traction."", ""The renewed focus on our Protective channel and direct customers has created positive momentum internally and has well been received by our customers. Similar to Food, we strive to protect products in transit in a sustainable way. Our strategy entails a dual-pronged approach. First, within our flexibles portfolio, we are continuously increasing the level of recycled content in our product lines. Second, we are in the process of adding more fiber solutions to our portfolio, which will enable us to fully serve our channel partners in all segments within our markets. As an example, we are expanding our paper mailer offerings with various sizes to match the versatility traditionally associated with plastic and hybrid mailers. Moreover, we've developed more resilient paper coilers as a sustainable fishing solution to address demands of protecting high-value heavyweight products."", 'Additionally, we are introducing fiber alternatives within our APS solutions, enabling substrate-agnostic capabilities for our automation portfolios. This approach ensures that existing equipment installations can accommodate both substrates, providing our customers with enhanced flexibility in their distribution processes. The transformation outlined in previous quarters continues at SEE. We are focused on improving underlying business fundamentals by improving our commercial effectiveness, innovation processes and overall talent. Overall portfolio and footprint optimization continues to progress with three plant closures last year and another four in process in 2024. Throughout the first quarter, we continued to wind down pieces of the portfolio announced last year.', ""And we continue to evaluate the rest of the portfolio and footprint for further opportunities. As mentioned earlier, we continue to accelerate our cost takeout initiatives. And it is driving improvements to our bottom line. With the actions implemented so far, we have achieved an annual run rate savings of $78 million. Continuing with this momentum, we are confident in our ability to achieve approximately $90 million in year-over-year cost savings in 2024. Finally, we are in the process of pivoting our digital and automation strategies. And we'll have more to share in subsequent calls. Now I'd like to turn it over to Dustin to review our financial results. Dustin?"", ""Dustin Semach: Thank you, Emile, and good morning, everyone. Moving to first quarter results, let's turn to Slide 4. Net sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, down 1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $278 million, up 4% compared to last year. Volumes were flat year-over-year for the quarter with growth in the Food segment across all regions offset by declines in Protective, primarily in EMEA. As reported, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.78 were up 5% compared to a year ago. Our adjusted tax rate was 25.9% compared to 24% in the same period last year. The increase in the tax rate year-over-year was driven by discrete impacts related to our share-based compensation. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2024 was 145.4 million."", ""Turning to Slide 5. In Q1, inorganic growth from Liquibox contributed 2% to total company sales or approximately $23 million. As anticipated, we saw lower pricing across both the Food and Protective segments, primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions, following the reduction of resin costs from the post-COVID peak in 2022 to the middle of 2023. Year-over-year volume improved in the Food segment across all regions through carryover momentum from last year's holiday season and new customer wins. Protective volumes were down 4% year-over-year, driven by a rebound in Americas, more than offset by declines primarily in EMEA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA of $278 million, which included $4 million inorganic contribution from Liquibox, increased $11 million or approximately 4% compared to last year with margins of 20.9%, up 110 basis points."", 'This performance was mainly driven by accelerated savings from our CTO2Grow and productivity efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorable net price realization. Moving to Slide 6. In the first quarter, Food net sales of $868 million were down 1% on an organic basis, primarily due to declines in price, partially offset by positive volumes led by carryover holiday benefits within our Food business, solid equipment performance, cattle cycle tailwinds in Asia Pac and Latin America, along with share gains of our case-ready solutions in the poultry market. Food adjusted EBITDA of $190 million in the first quarter was down 3% with margins at 21.8%, down 100 basis points compared to last year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was mainly driven by unfavorable net price realization of $10 million, partially offset by higher volumes.', 'Protective first quarter net sales of $461 million were down 7% organically, driven by lower pricing in Americas and EMEA and volume declines primarily in EMEA, where both industrial and fulfillment end markets remain soft and sustainability pressures are accelerating. Americas volume rebounded with strong automation solutions offsetting continued industrial weakness. Protective adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million was up 11% in the first quarter with margins at 19.4%, up 320 basis points. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by cost control actions, which included CTO2Grow savings, partially offset by unfavorable net price realization of approximately $10 million in lower volumes. On Slide 7, we review our first quarter net sales by region.', ""On an organic basis, Americas was down 2% primarily due to lower pricing. Volume turned positive year-over-year for both segments for the first time since the end of 2021 with robust equipment placements in both businesses and strong volume within Food. EMEA declined 7% organically on lower pricing, persisting market softness and sustainability challenges in the Protective segment while Food volumes grew mid-single digit. Asia Pac was flat organically as tailwinds from Australian cattle cycle and improving electronic performance were offset by continued weakness in the industrial markets. Now let's turn to free cash flow and leverage on Slide 8. Through the first quarter, we generated strong free cash flow of $78 million compared to $13 million use of cash in the same period a year ago."", ""The primary driver of this improvement was higher earnings, lower incentive compensation payments and better working capital management, partially offset by higher interest costs. During the first quarter, we further reduced our total debt by $28 million, ending the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.9x, flat from the end of 2023. Our total liquidity position was $1.4 billion, including $353 million in cash and the remaining amount in committed and fully undrawn revolver. We continue to focus on driving net debt to adjusted EBITDA to below 3.5x by the end of 2025. Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our 2024 outlook. We are pleased with the strong finish to the first quarter and encouraged by the momentum that is building in parts of the business."", ""The strength of the first quarter is giving us more confidence in our full year guidance. We continue to operate in a low visibility environment, especially in Protective. And we'll have better visibility into how this momentum translates into the second half during our next call. For now, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 outlook. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate a slight sequential decline in sales, reflecting the dynamic low visibility environment and subsiding holiday demand from last year. As a result, second quarter net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are expected to be ranging around $1.3 billion, $260 million and $0.64, respectively. Turning to Slide 10. We remain committed to restoring underlying fundamentals by executing in the market, progressing our transformation, delivering CTO2Grow savings and deleveraging the balance sheet."", ""Lastly, I'd like to close by thanking the global SEE team, who are at the center of our transformation, for their efforts in solving our customers' most critical packaging challenges day in, day out. With that, Emile and I look forward to your questions. Operator, we would like to begin the Q&A session."", 'See also', '20 Best Korean Skincare Products of 2024 and', '10 Best Trucking Stocks to Buy.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Stay tuned.', ""This week in AI, eight prominent U.S. newspapers owned by investment giant Alden Global Capital, including the New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune and Orlando Sentinel, sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement relating to the companies' use of generative AI tech. They, like The New York Times in its ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI, accuse OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping their IP without permission or compensation to build and commercialize generative models such as GPT-4."", '“We’ve spent billions of dollars gathering information and reporting news at our publications, and we can’t allow OpenAI and Microsoft to expand the big tech playbook of stealing our work to build their own businesses at our expense,” Frank Pine, the executive editor overseeing Alden’s newspapers, said in a statement.', ""The suit seems likely to end in a settlement and licensing deal, given OpenAI's existing partnerships with publishers and its reluctance to hinge the whole of its business model on the fair use argument. But what about the rest of the content creators whose works are being swept up in model training without payment?"", ""It seems OpenAI's thinking about that."", 'A recently published research paper co-authored by Boaz Barak, a scientist on OpenAI\'s Superalignment team, proposes a framework to compensate copyright owners ""proportionally to their contributions to the creation of AI-generated content."" How? Through cooperative game theory.', 'The framework evaluates to what extent content in a training dataset -- for example, text, images or some other data -- influences what a model generates, employing a game theory concept known as the Shapley value. Then, based on that evaluation, it determines the content owners\' ""rightful share"" (i.e., compensation).', ""Let's say you have an image-generating model trained using artwork from four artists: John, Jacob, Jack and Jebediah. You ask it to draw a flower in Jack's style. With the framework, you can determine the influence each artist's work had on the art the model generates and, thus, the compensation that each should receive."", ""There is a downside to the framework, however -- it's computationally expensive. The researchers' workarounds rely on estimates of compensation rather than exact calculations. Would that satisfy content creators? I'm not so sure. If OpenAI someday puts it into practice, we'll certainly find out."", 'Here are some other AI stories of note from the past few days:', ""Microsoft reaffirms facial recognition ban: Language added to the terms of service for Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft's fully managed wrapper around OpenAI tech, more clearly prohibits integrations from being used “by or for” police departments for facial recognition in the U.S."", 'The nature of AI-native startups: AI startups face a different set of challenges from your typical software-as-a-service company.

While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away."", ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. This comes in at 0.03% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size.

The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Paychex investors that purchase the stock on or after the 9th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of May."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.98 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$3.56 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Paychex stock has a trailing yield of around 3.0% on the current share price of US$120.10.

It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow.

If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Paychex's earnings per share have risen 11% per annum over the last five years. It paid out more than three-quarters of its earnings in the last year, even though earnings per share are growing rapidly. We're surprised that management has not elected to reinvest more in the business to accelerate growth further."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Paychex has delivered 10% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it."", ""Is Paychex an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. However, we'd also note that Paychex is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows.

The stock is now down about 35% over the past year.', ""Let's look at why Starbucks stock fell, what its turnaround plans are, and whether now is a good time to buy the stock."", 'With the U.S. and China representing over 60% of Starbucks global locations, these two markets are the most important for the coffeehouse operator. Unfortunately for the company, both markets saw considerable weakness during the quarter.', 'In the U.S., Starbucks saw its same-store sales decline 3% compared to a 12% increase a year ago. Traffic to its stores fell 7%, while the average ticket price rose 4%.', 'The company blamed a weakening economic outlook and severe weather in parts of the country for its weak U.S. results. Starbucks said that its occasional customers, in particular, were coming in less often. Increased prices together with a shift toward higher-priced cold drinks helped lift its average ticket.', 'In China, meanwhile, comparable-store sales sank 11% compared to a 3% increase a year ago. Traffic to its stores fell 4%, while the average ticket dropped 8%. Starbucks became more promotional in China in the fourth quarter, when its average ticket was down 9%. However, that helped lead to a 21% increase in traffic. More promotions and lower prices did not have the same impact in the first quarter of 2024.', ""Starbucks said that as in the U.S., occasional customers in China were visiting its coffee shops less often. It said this was a result of macroeconomic weakness, competition, and a return to more normal behavior after last year's market reopening."", 'Given its poor results, Starbucks does not plan to sit by idly; it laid out efforts to help turn around its operations.', ""In the U.S., it will look to improve throughput by lowering wait times and having better product availability. Management said currently the company has difficulties meeting peak morning demand, and that app customers often put items in their carts but don't complete their purchases due to long wait times."", ""As a result, Starbucks is rolling out its equipment-driven Siren System and fine-tuning how it's used to help speed up orders. The company is also investing in its Deep Brew artificial intelligence (AI) technology to both improve wait times and create more transparency into wait times, as well as making supply chain investments."", ""Starbucks will also launch more innovative menu offerings, both beverages and food items, with an emphasis on coffee beverages. In addition, the company is testing extended overnight hours, with delivery between 5 p.m. and 5 a.m. It's also looking at better ways to connect with occasional customers through its app, so these customers can see special offers."", ""In China, meanwhile, the company said it's continuing to play the long game. Its strategy remains making technology investments to digitize its stores, and continuing to innovate by offering locally relevant menu items. It will also keep opening more locations in China, especially in lower-tier markets and county-level cities, where it has been seeing better new-store economics."", ""Starbucks' problems in the U.S. are likely temporary, although they won't be fixed overnight. After years of increased prices from a high inflationary environment, consumers are starting to cut back. While Starbucks has a solid plan in place to help reinvigorate growth in the U.S., if consumer buying power continues to weaken, these initiatives likely won't help in the near term. However, they could set the company up well longer-term."", 'China is the bigger worry, as the competitive landscape is fierce. Luckin Coffee (OTC: LKNC.Y) and other competitors continue to rapidly expand their number of locations in the country, while offering lower prices. Luckin opened a whopping 2,342 new stores in the first quarter. Even Yum China Holdings (NYSE: YUMC), the owner of KFC in China, has gotten in on the coffee game with its KCoffee brand, as well as having a joint venture with Italian coffee roaster Lavazza for Lavazza-branded coffee shops.', ""China is not only Starbucks' second-largest market, but also its biggest market for opening new locations. Right now, it appears China is getting inundated with coffee shops."", ""Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20, Starbucks is at one of its lowest valuations in quite some time. This isn't the first time the company has faced pressure, and founder Howard Schultz famously returned as CEO of the company back in 2008 to right the ship and turn Starbucks around. Schultz just retired from Starbucks' board last year."", ""Over the long term, Starbucks should be a solid investment.

(NYSE: BROS) and established chains like Dunkin' Donuts are as busy as they've ever been."", 'The underlying dynamic is one that current or prospective shareholders of either outfit will want to understand, since it could remain in place for a while.', 'As was noted, Starbucks\' top line fell 2% last quarter, all but ending a long but consistently slowing growth streak. CEO Laxman Narasimhan chalked it up to the ""highly challenged environment."" And he\'s not wrong. The average consumer is feeling the clear pinch of inflation these days.', ""If this were the first time the chain bumped into a headwind, it might be dismissible. It's not the first time, though; Starbucks' draw has been fading since late last year. Data from consumer market research outfit Placer.AI indicates the company's foot-traffic growth has essentially stagnated between then and March of this year. In a similar vein, numbers from Earnest Analytics say Starbucks' share of consumers' spending on prepared coffee deteriorated in 2023, in step with shrinking ticket sizes and transactions -- weakness that wasn't always apparent in the recent quarterly numbers."", ""But these consumers aren't necessarily spending less on coffee and other beverages. As already noted, they're just purchasing their drinks somewhere else."", ""One of the chief beneficiaries of this spending shift is the aforementioned Dutch Bros. While the growth of Starbucks' foot traffic has been shrinking since last year, Dutch Bros' growth in traffic has actually been accelerating, according to data from Placer.AI:"", ""As of the end of last year, Earnest Analytics reports, Dutch Bros. accounted for 6% of U.S. consumer spending on coffee and other premium drinks. That's up from just 4% as of the end of 2020. Dutch Bros' quarterly results during that period show corresponding growth. Last year's revenue was up nearly 31%, for perspective, while its same-store sales improved nearly 3%:"", 'What gives?', ""Your likely gut instinct isn't misleading you: People are in some palpable financial pain right now. They're not giving up treats like prepared coffee, but they are willing to try something that's not quite as pricey as the typical Starbucks beverage. Coffee and other drinks from a Dutch Bros. drive-thru are an affordable compromise."", ""And it's not Dutch Bros. saying so, for the record. It's not just Starbucks, either (despite Narasimhan's acknowledgement that the current environment is a tough one for the average consumer). We're hearing a similar message from lots of consumer-facing companies."", 'Take McDonald\'s as an example. While it\'s usually a place for an affordable meal, McDonald\'s CEO Chris Kempczinski explains that ""Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they faced elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the industry."" This discrimination ultimately led the fast-food chain to a shortfall from its first-quarter earnings estimates, with modest U.S. same-store sales growth of 2.5% still missing expectations of 2.6%.', ""The Kraft Heinz Company is seeing similar caution. Although its first-quarter revenue was more or less in line with estimates, those sales still fell 1.2% year over year, while organic sales slipped 0.5%. Total volume of food sold during the quarter was down 3.2%, with many consumers rejecting the food giant's most recent round of price increases. Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera commented on the headwind:"", '""[L]ower-income consumers are challenged with interest rates remaining high, gas prices elevated and savings dwindling. So there\'s a clear pullback of restaurant spend by these lower-earning households, especially in restaurants and convenience stores. These consumers instead are looking for value as they prepare more meals at home.""', ""People are counting their pennies. Inflation is changing how they spend even if it's not preventing them from spending. Premium is out. Value is in."", ""It's of course a dynamic that plays right into the hand Dutch Bros. is holding."", ""This theory will be put to the test on Tuesday, May 7, after the market closes. That's when Dutch Bros. is scheduled to post its first-quarter results. Analysts are calling for revenue of $255.7 million and earnings of $0.02 per share, up from the year-ago comparisons of $197.3 million and a breakeven, respectively. This growth outlook jibes with the data and trends highlighted by Earnest Analytics and Placer.AI, boding well for Dutch Bros. stock."", ""Just as its Q1 numbers could underscore Dutch Bros. stock's potential upside, though, they may also indirectly affirm that Starbucks stock remains a tough one to own for the indefinite future."", ""See, despite last quarter's weakness, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri says the company currently has no plans to lower prices. It instead intends to address the challenge by inducing more sales from consumers who aren't exactly regular customers. Investors are understandably worried that that's not quite the right plan for an inflation-riddled environment that could linger for at least a few more quarters."", 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dutch Bros wasn’t one of them.

Although it is a U.S. cigarette maker, it has a global footprint, which separates it from both Altria (NYSE: MO), which only operates in the U.S., and Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM), which sells cigarettes internationally but not in the U.S. market.', ""British American Tobacco made a huge admission about the future of the U.S. cigarette market in 2023 that investors in tobacco stocks should not ignore. Here's what you need to know."", ""Although a somewhat complex topic, the issue here boils down to the accounting treatment of British American Tobacco's U.S. cigarette brands. Previously the company assumed that the brands would be around forever -- but now it has decided that, at some point, they will no longer exist. The company described the change as:"", '...with effect from 1 January 2024, Newport, Camel, Natural American Spirit and Pall Mall will be amortised on a straight-lined basis. Pall Mall will be amortised over a 20-year period and Newport, Camel and Natural American Spirit will be amortised over a 30-year period. From 2024, the increase in annual amortisation expense is expected to be £1.4 billion per annum for the next 20 years, after which it is expected to decline to £1.3 billion.', ""In plain English, British American Tobacco is basically saying that its best guess is that Pall Mall as a brand will have little to no value in the U.S. in 20 years. Newport, Camel, and Natural American Spirit will likely end up in the same place just 10 years later. This is a big change, and it means that the company has to amortize the value of the four brands each year, which is basically taking a charge that accounts for the loss of their value during that year. That extra cost will be a headwind to earnings each year. This is going to have a material lingering effect on the company's financial results."", ""But that's not all. British American Tobacco's decision also forced it to immediately reduce the carrying value of the brands on its balance sheet:"", 'In addition, the Group have recognised a non-cash adjusting impairment charge of £23.0 billion against certain of our acquired U.S. brands which have been previously recognised as indefinite-lived and an impairment to the Reynolds goodwill of £4.3 billion...', ""The big-picture takeaway here is that British American Tobacco is effectively telling investors that the U.S. cigarette market is not just in a steady decline, but that it will eventually go to zero. That clearly impacted the company's 2023 results, which fell deep into negative territory thanks to the write off. To put a number on that, earnings declined 322% year over year in 2023. However, it is important to note that a smaller headwind will continue each and every year for the next 30 years thanks to the increase in amortization costs."", ""And then investors need to consider the broader statement being made. British American Tobacco has a global portfolio of cigarette brands, with some markets performing differently than others. So there's an offset of sorts to its U.S. business."", 'But what about Altria? Altria and Philip Morris International effectively share the Philip Morris portfolio of brands, headlined by Marlboro. Philip Morris International sells the brands internationally, while Altria sells them only in the U.S. market.', ""British American Tobacco's accounting shift basically suggests that Altria's cigarette business has an expiration date. Philip Morris International is in a better position because, like British American Tobacco, it operates in foreign markets."", 'The U.S. is probably ahead of the curve, to some extent, when it comes to cigarette demand trends, so investors need to pay close attention to the decision British American Tobacco just made. It might be off on the exact dates, but it is telling investors to expect that cigarettes will eventually be phased out.', 'And that increases the need for British American Tobacco, Altria, and Philip Morris International to find new businesses to replace the dying cigarette lines that now dominate their income statements.\xa0If you own any of these companies, you need to start paying very close attention to the success they are having in the effort to find a replacement for cigarettes.

However, Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) offers investors an attractive dividend yield and one of the biggest underappreciated growth stories for consumer products.', 'Phillip Morris International just posted another terrific quarter and raised its guidance when it reported its first-quarter earnings results. These results were once again led by Zyn, which saw its volume surge nearly 80% year over year in the U.S. to 131.6 million cans. Overall, Phillip Morris saw its revenue increase 11% on an organic basis to $8.8 billion and organic operating profit climb 22% to $3.0 billion.', ""Zyn is a nicotine pouch product that Philip Morris acquired as part of its acquisition of Swedish Match at the end of 2022. The product is made of nicotine powder and flavorings such as mint or cinnamon and does not contain any tobacco. Since the product does not contain tobacco, users don't have to spit like they do with traditional chewing tobacco."", 'While the product is being sold in the U.S., it is still currently being reviewed by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). Philip Morris touts it as a safer alternative to smoking and other tobacco products that can help wean people off tobacco products.', 'The product has become a bit of a hot-button political issue, with Democratic Senator Charles Schumer asking regulators earlier this year to investigate whether the product was being promoted to teens.', 'For its part, the FDA said the use of Zyn among high school and middle school students was low, at only about 1.5% compared to 10% of students that vaped. This is important, as vaping company Juul Labs went from being valued at $38 billion to trying to stave off bankruptcy after being beset by legal challenges and settlements over marketing its products to children. At its height, 28% of high schoolers had vaped, compared to only 3% of adults. Zyn appears to be very careful in its marketing and does not appear to have these usage issues with children.', ""While Zyn has been in the U.S. since 2014, it was primarily located in western markets and only launched nationally about five years ago. The product's popularity really took off after Philip Morris's acquisition, as it was able to increase its distribution."", ""Zyn has become very popular with Gen-Z adult males, and this demographic is marketing the product for the company free of charge through social media and other outlets. The political sparring between political parties surrounding it seems to have only added to the product's appeal among some users."", 'Given that Philip Morris does not sell cigarettes in the U.S., every smoker it can convert to Zyn is a big win for the company. In fact, the company has said that the product contribution level of Zyn in the U.S. is 6 times that of its cigarette products. So not only is Zyn seeing explosive sales growth, but it comes with a much higher margin as well.', ""Given the demand for Zyn and the market penetration it has seen in early western U.S. markets, the company is spending money to increase Zyn's production capacity in the U.S. to meet expected demand. This should help fuel growth in the years to come."", 'Zyn is one of the fast-growing consumer goods products around, yet Philip Morris stock has barely budged over the past few years. With the company trading at about 15 times forward earnings and growing revenue by double digits, the stock is cheap. It also has an attractive 5.5% dividend yield, and the company has grown its dividend every year since it was spun off from Altria Group in 2008, nearly tripling it during that span.', 'Philip Morris offers both a high yield and one of the best growth stories around with Zyn at an attractive valuation.

Here's what you need to know to make the call."", 'In early 2008 Altria spun off Philip Morris International. In effect, Altria retained the rights to sell Philip Morris brands in the United States while Philip Morris International sold those same brands outside the United States. In this way, the two companies share the same iconic cigarette brand portfolio, which includes industry giant Marlboro.', 'According to Altria: ""Altria\'s Board of Directors and management believed that the spin-off would enable each of Altria\'s international and domestic tobacco businesses to focus exclusively on realizing its own opportunities and addressing its own challenges, thereby building long-term shareholder value.""', ""The big-picture problem is the global shift away from cigarette smoking. Both are working to find new nicotine-based products to offset the decline in their core cigarette operations. However, with Altria focused on just one market, the risk involved is more binary. Philip Morris International benefits from the diversification of having different markets in its portfolio. Altria's ultra-high dividend yield is, at least in part, a sign of this increased risk."", 'That said, Altria was an early investor in vape maker Juul and marijuana company Cronos. At the time of investment both made logical sense, as they could help the company broaden beyond cigarettes. However, neither one turned out to be successful, with the pair leading to massive writedowns and one-time charges.', ""Altria is trying again with vapes, having recently acquired Njoy. While it is still early, Njoy was at a later stage of business development when acquired and the deal probably has a higher likelihood of turning out successful. But it's hard to ignore the bad track record Altria has with regard to big corporate moves."", ""That includes spinning off Philip Morris International. Although the two don't compete with regard to cigarettes, Philip Morris International is increasingly a competitor in non-cigarette arenas in the United States. So Altria basically created a competitor when it spun off Philip Morris International. Altria's series of poor strategic decisions is another reason the stock's dividend yield is so high."", 'In an industry that\'s going through a major transition, Philip Morris International has simply executed better. In the company\'s 2023 annual report, it provided an update on its success: ""In 2023, our smoke-free portfolio accounted for 36.5% of total net revenues, with 25 markets generating more than 50% of their total net revenues from smoke-free products. As of year-end, our smoke-free products had approximately 33 million users and were available in 84 markets.""', ""While Philip Morris International's dividend yield is lower, at 5.4%, the company's business shift is clearly going relatively well compared with Altria's efforts. Investors are rewarding the company for its success, noting that more than a third of the top line is not cigarette-related."", 'Altria has supported its dividend by enacting price increases. That has worked well so far to offset the ongoing declines in the company\'s cigarette business, and it will probably continue to work for at least a little longer. But at some point, Altria\'s price increases will probably start to exacerbate the pain it\'s feeling in cigarette sales. And with the poor track record management has achieved in finding alternatives, this is not a ""set it and forget it"" dividend investment. The high yield comes along with high risk.', 'Most long-term dividend investors would be better off accepting a lower yield from Philip Morris International. Doing so will still provide you a still material income stream, but that income will come from a similar company that has been executing at a much higher level.', 'Before you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Altria Group wasn’t one of them.

So we need to investigate whether PPG Industries can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for PPG Industries ', 'Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut.

If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's not encouraging to see that PPG Industries's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share. Earnings per share growth in recent times has not been a standout. Yet there are several ways to grow the dividend, and one of them is simply that the company may choose to pay out more of its earnings as dividends."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. PPG Industries has delivered an average of 7.9% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments."", ""Should investors buy PPG Industries for the upcoming dividend? The company has barely grown earnings per share over this time, but at least it's paying out a decently low percentage of its earnings and cashflow as dividends.

Chief among high-performance energy stocks are those in the oil sector which currently adhere to geopolitical shifts. Now more than ever, this is driving increased speculation on which global oil stocks to buy.', 'The first factor is the degradation of stability in the Middle East due to recent hostilities between Israel and Hamas. This conflict has spilled into a wider crisis, perpetuated by Iran and the non-state actors it sponsors, such as the Houthis and Hezbollah. While some signs of de-escalation are emerging, critical oil extraction sites and shipping routes could become increasingly jeopardized.', 'Any further decrease in stability or productivity could drive crude oil prices up again, or companies outside of the region may pick up the slack eventually.

It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$4.9b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Aptiv surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$0.79 per share, a notable 11% above expectations. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Aptiv ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Aptiv's 21 analysts is for revenues of US$21.3b in 2024. This would reflect a modest 5.8% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to nosedive 58% to US$4.57 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$21.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.44 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates."", ""There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$102, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Aptiv analyst has a price target of US$145 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$58.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Aptiv'shistorical trends, as the 7.8% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 8.7% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry (in aggregate), which analyst estimates suggest will see revenues grow 11% annually. So it's pretty clear that Aptiv is expected to grow slower than similar companies in the same industry."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Aptiv's earnings potential next year. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Aptiv's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Aptiv analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""You still need to take note of risks, for example - Aptiv has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about."", 'Have feedback on this article?

This makes the dividend yield 3.4%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.', ' See our latest analysis for Perrigo ', ""We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. While Perrigo is not profitable, it is paying out less than 75% of its free cash flow, which means that there is plenty left over for reinvestment into the business. We generally think that cash flow is more important than accounting measures of profit, so we are fairly comfortable with the dividend at this level."", 'Earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 3,318%, which is unsustainable.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.36 total annually to $1.1. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Perrigo's earnings per share has shrunk at 53% a year over the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable."", ""Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Perrigo that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Solid economic growth and modest loan demand will also support banks’ financials in the near term.', 'Business restructuring/expansion initiatives and digitization will offer support. Though weakening asset quality is likely to exert pressure on the financials to some extent, major banks like Wells Fargo & Co. and Northern Trust Corp. are worth investing in.', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry includes the nation’s largest banks in terms of assets, with most operating globally. The financial performance of these banks largely depends on the nation’s economic health. As the banks are involved in several complex financial activities, they are required to meet the stringent regulations set by the Federal Reserve and other agencies.', 'Apart from traditional banking services, which are the source of the net interest income (NII), major regional banks provide a wide array of other financial services and products to retail, corporate and institutional clients, both domestic and global. These include credit and debit cards, mortgage banking, wealth management and investment banking, among others. Therefore, a large revenue source for these banks is fees and commissions earned from these services.', 'High-Interest Rates: The Fed’s aggressive monetary policy since March 2022 has led the interest rates to touch a 23-year high of 5.25-5.5% as it continues to fight ‘sticky’ inflation. While the inflation numbers are cooling down, the path for it to reach the central bank’s target of 2% is going to be bumpy. Hence, the market participants seem to have watered down the chances of a 75-basis point cut in interest rates this year. The tighter job market is also not helping the case.', 'While the faster pace of rate hikes puts pressure on major banks’ net interest margin (NIM) because of an increase in funding costs, high rates for a longer period will be a boon for the industry players on the back of decent economic growth, resilient consumers and modest deposit inflows. This will support banks’ NII growth, though at a slower pace than in 2023.', 'Business Restructuring Initiatives: Major regional banks are taking strategic actions to expand into new avenues and lower their dependence on spread income. The business restructuring is essential for technological advancement and further domestic/global expansion to continue improving profitability.', 'The industry players are constantly investing in artificial intelligence and other digital platforms and even partnering/acquiring providers of such services. Major regional banks are also aggressively expanding their footprint outside the United States and into Europe and Asia. Several industry players are re-evaluating their business structure to simplify operations and do away with unprofitable ones.', 'Modest Loan Demand: The central bank’s aggressive monetary policy lowered the demand for loans due to fears of a severe economic downturn/recession. Nonetheless, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections released in March indicates that the U.S. economy will slow down slightly this year and grow at a rate of 2.1%. In 2023, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 2.5%, per the data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.', 'While the high rates kept the borrowers on the sidelines for the major part of last year, the Fed’s higher-for-longer stance is likely to reverse the trend to some extent in 2024. The demand for loans is likely to tick up marginally as borrowers get used to the high interest rate environment.', 'Weakening Asset Quality: For most of 2020, major regional banks built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, banks began to release these reserves back into the income statement.', 'Now, given the current macroeconomic headwinds, industry players are building provisions to counter any adverse fallout.

Its revenues witnessed a CAGR of 3.5% over the last three years (2020-2023), driven by rising non-interest income and NII.

This makes the dividend yield 3.5%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.', ' View our latest analysis for Northern Trust ', ""If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much."", ""Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Northern Trust has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 66%, which means that Northern Trust would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet."", 'Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 78.7%. The future payout ratio could be 45% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.24 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $3.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.2% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though Northern Trust's EPS has declined at around 7.0% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend."", ""Overall, a consistent dividend is a good thing, and we think that Northern Trust has the ability to continue this into the future. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio."", 'Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company.

So, how likely is that to happen?"", ""NextEra Energy is trading well off its highs. The company often borrows to help fund these large projects, and higher interest rates always make borrowing more expensive.

However, despite this, both economic growth and the labor market have displayed resilience. Recent economic indicators have prompted Morgan Stanley Research to revise its forecast for U.S. economic growth, now projecting 2.3% for 2024 and 2.1% for 2025, up from previous estimates of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Consequently, the Fed is expected to initiate the first rate cut of this cycle in July, instead of the previously anticipated June, followed by two more 25 basis point cuts by year-end. Looking ahead to 2025, Morgan Stanley anticipates a continued downward trend in rates, with the Fed making cuts at each meeting through June, aiming to reach a rate of 3.625%.', 'The first quarter of 2024 marked Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick\'s inaugural term, with his background in investment banking and trading standing in contrast to his predecessor James Gorman\'s focus on wealth management. Pick\'s tenure began on a challenging note, with the bank facing headwinds from high-interest rates prompting wealth management clients to shift funds into higher-yielding securities. By April 16, the bank\'s shares had declined by nearly 7% for the year. However, similar to its competitors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley benefitted from robust trading and investment banking performance in Q1. Pick, emphasizing the vital role of dealmaking as an ""existential reality"" for companies, signaled a potential catalyst for Wall Street\'s awaited recovery in investment banking. While Morgan Stanley\'s resurgence in investment banking trailed some of its competitors—Goldman Sachs saw a 32% increase in fees—Pick remained optimistic.', '""I’m feeling good about this being early-to-mid cycle for the classic investment banking, capital markets business around the world,"" said Pick, who succeeded long-serving chief James Gorman in January.', 'See also: Goldman Sachs’ Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024.', ""The results underscored the prowess of Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm, which has been pivotal in driving the bank's growth in recent years, particularly evident in its ability to attract significant new client assets. This led to the bank's first-quarter profits surging by 14% year-over-year to $3.41 billion, or $2.02 per share, with each of its three main divisions contributing to the growth, while revenue increased by 4% to $15.14 billion. Wealth management revenue rose by 4.9% to $6.88 billion, surpassing estimates by $230 million, driven by market gains boosting fee revenue despite a decrease in interest income. At the same time, fixed-income trading revenue dipped by 3.5% to $2.49 billion but still beat expectations by $120 million. Investment banking revenue surged by 16% to $1.45 billion, slightly surpassing the $1.40 billion estimate, driven by higher debt and equity issuance, offsetting lower acquisition fees."", ""Speaking more on its outlook for the future, this is what the bank's management had to say during the first quarter 2024 earnings call:"", 'Looking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII. Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working. We have a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management. We remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable 30% pretax profits over time. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4 billion increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues, which increased 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels.', 'We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which similar to prior years will exhibit some quarter to quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves, our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside as it was designed to do. With client assets at a record of $7 trillion across Wealth and Investment Management, we are on strong footing. Our Wealth Management business continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice in delivering our differentiated offering, and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint.

These downfalls were specifically concerning because of their widespread impacts, affecting various geographical regions. Bank shares remained under pressure throughout 2023, but they experienced a notable surge toward the end of October. This was fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would conclude its campaign of raising interest rates without causing a recession. Financials ended up finishing the year with positive returns, with the S&P 500 Financials delivering a 12.15% return to shareholders.', 'That said, since high-interest rates are still at play, the financial sector is not completely out of the dangers it suffered from in the spring of 2023. As CNBC reported, the Federal Reserve hasn’t started lowering its main interest rate, because of which banks still have massive amounts of unrealized losses from bonds and loans with low-interest rates on their financial records. This, along with possible losses from commercial real estate, puts large parts of the banking sector at risk. The report further mentioned that over 280 US banks, collectively holding nearly $900 billion in assets, face potential capital needs due to high levels of exposure to commercial real estate and losses related to interest rates.', 'Many financial analysts anticipate rate cuts in 2024 that could mainly influence the performance of bank stocks.

On the other hand, we saw how high-interest rates last year were beneficial for the biggest banks as they managed to amass $253 billion in NII, marking an increase of approximately $80 billion compared to the total in 2021. S&P Global also expects NII to decline in 2024, however, the firm also anticipates that banks will achieve a return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11% and will build their capital reserves by retaining earnings.', 'Financial companies are also known for paying dividends to shareholders. In fact, if we look at the recent data, we get to know that nearly half of the global increases in dividend payouts in 2023 originated from banks, exceeding their share in the total dividend payments, which is one-sixth, according to a report by Janus Henderson. The report also mentioned that the significant 15% rise, reaching a record $220 billion, primarily came from banks’ improved profitability due to the normalization of interest rates following years of loose monetary policies.

Certain of the outlook numbers include adjusted operating income (loss) (a non-GAAP metric) for each segment. The Company is not able to reconcile its full-year fiscal 2024 projected adjusted results to its fiscal 2024 projected GAAP results because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of our control. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature of and the amount of any potential applicable future adjustments, which could be significant, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for these forward-looking non-GAAP measures without unreasonable effort.

(NYSE:WEC) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest quarterly results, and the shares gained 2.1% to US$83.22. WEC Energy Group missed revenue estimates by 8.7%, coming in atUS$2.7b, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.97 beat expectations, coming in 3.3% ahead of analyst estimates. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group ', 'After the latest results, the twelve analysts covering WEC Energy Group are now predicting revenues of US$9.12b in 2024. If met, this would reflect an okay 5.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to accumulate 6.5% to US$4.88. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$9.59b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.88 in 2024. The consensus seems maybe a little more pessimistic, trimming their revenue forecasts after the latest results even though there was no change to its EPS estimates.', ""The average price target was steady at US$87.84even though revenue estimates declined; likely suggesting the analysts place a higher value on earnings. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on WEC Energy Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$96.00 and the most bearish at US$78.00 per share. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that WEC Energy Group is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the WEC Energy Group's past performance and to peers in the same industry. The analysts are definitely expecting WEC Energy Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 6.8% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 5.4% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 4.5% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect WEC Energy Group to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, but the latest forecasts still imply the business will grow faster than the wider industry. Still, earnings per share are more important to value creation for shareholders. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Medtronic:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.077 = US$6.3b ÷ (US$91b - US$9.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).', ""Thus, Medtronic has an ROCE of 7.7%.

This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Medtronic doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Medtronic has been paying out a decent 52% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders."", ""In summary, Medtronic isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed.

Miller, co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle Inc., (NYSE: CCI) (""Crown Castle"" or the ""Company""), today issued the following statement in response to the misleading investor presentation filed by Crown Castle in connection with its upcoming 2024 Annual Meeting:', '""Boots Capital began evaluating how Crown Castle\'s fiber assets could be divested in August 2023 – while Crown Castle was still publicly committed to its fiber strategy – in large part driven by conversations with Company shareholders. Repeatedly, we tried to engage constructively and cooperatively with the Company by bringing them an actionable and timely plan with a list of parties who will transact.', ""Crown Castle's Board continues to refuse to so much as look at our analysis, which comprises hundreds of pages of detailed work. It has since resorted to publicizing outright mistruths and attacks on our motives and experience as a way to scare shareholders. However, these are the same shareholders who have suffered under 10 years of Crown Castle's terrible underperformance and a corporate governance approach that has been openly hostile to their interests. Shareholders should not be fooled."", 'We need not review each falsehood point by point, but there are a few key false claims that must be corrected:', 'First, Boots Capital does not seek direct or ""de-facto control"" of Crown Castle and believes all Crown Castle directors should be treated equally. Boots Capital is only seeking four seats out of twelve and we have repeatedly stated we do not seek the executive chairman role. Boots Capital originally made the executive chairman request while the Company was in a leadership crisis, after the abrupt resignation of the CEO and the ensuing vacuum created by the Board\'s lack of a succession plan. We intended to act as a leadership bridge and a resource for the executive team during this time of uncertainty following key personnel departures. During a March 19, 2024 meeting in San Diego with Mr. Bartolo, we offered to settle the proxy fight for two directors with no executive chairman or committee representation. This offer was rejected.', 'Moreover, in a conversation with Mr. Bartolo and Mr. Moskowitz on April 29, 2024, we reiterated our settlement proposal of two directors and were clear again that this offer did not involve an ""executive chairman"" nor a ""co-chairman"" request. This offer was also rejected, yet the Company continues to knowingly and blatantly promote a false narrative that we are seeking control despite these facts.', 'Second, we plan to work constructively with Crown\'s new CEO and vocally supported his appointment to the Board. In several places, the Company\'s recent presentation accuses Boots Capital of ""objecting to the appointment of the new CEO, Steven Moskowitz to the Board."" We specifically did not object to Mr. Moskowitz\'s board appointment when we objected to the Board\'s last-minute increase in the total number of board seats from 12 to 13 in the middle of a proxy fight. Rather, we informed the Company the right decision would be to remove one of the Board\'s more tenured directors, who has presided over significant and lengthy value destruction, to allow Mr. Moskowitz to be on the Board. In fact, the Board, not Boots Capital, made the decision to remove Mr. Moskowitz.', 'In our view, Crown Castle\'s Board is more focused on words than actions and has put forth no credible plan to reverse years of underperformance while shareholders have been left to suffer. Despite the Board\'s repeated focus on its ""refresh"" as evidence of positive change, Crown Castle\'s share performance has only worsened since its 2020 board turnover, while its direct peers, AMT and SBAC, have seen relative TSR of 542% and 153%, respectively, over that period. The fact is that despite agreeing to review fiber after attacks from Elliott beginning in 2020, the Board has continued to make the wrong decisions. Crown Castle\'s core towers business remains neglected – over the past ten years, the Company has not grown its tower count and has become 38% less efficient – the Company has invested $4.4bn in fiber since the end of 2019, and capital continues to be invested behind the fiber strategy, with an additional $1.4bn budgeted for 2024 alone. Shareholders should never confuse window dressing with results.', ""We also question why Crown Castle changed the peer index it uses to benchmark its performance in its recent presentation. In its definitive proxy statements for this year and last, the Company used the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index as its reference, but in its recent investor presentation, the Company suddenly pivots to using the iShares US Telecommunications ETF. We believe this reflects a desperate attempt to cherry-pick performance that is not indicative of where the Company stands today.

It was already winning market share by beating Boeing to develop a line of fuel-efficient, mid-sized aircraft that are cheaper for airlines to fly.', 'And now Boeing is facing a government-mandated production cap on its best-selling plane.', 'Yet the European company is unlikely to extend its advantage in the Airbus-Boeing duopoly much further despite having customers clamoring for more commercial aircraft, according to aviation analysts. The reason: Airbus already is making planes as fast as it can and has a backlog of more than 8,600 orders to fill.', 'Its ability to leverage Boeing’s troubles therefore is “very limited,” according to Jonathan Berger, managing director at Alton Aviation Consultancy. Between strained supply chains and the long lead times for a hugely complex and highly regulated product, a jetliner ordered from Airbus today may not arrive until the end of the decade.', 'Boeing also has a huge order backlog for more than 5,660 commercial planes. The mismatch between the post-COVID demand for flights and the aircraft supply pipeline is bad news for travelers as well as airlines.', '“This has been an incredibly strong market recovery, and people need more jets than they’re getting,” said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “And until they get those jets, you don’t have enough capacity. Guess what goes up? Ticket prices.”', 'At the beginning of the year, Boeing seemed finally to be recovering from two crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Then, on Jan. 5, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9, and the company has been reeling ever since.', 'Boeing has since slowed manufacturing at the order of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. It lost $355 million in the first quarter because of a decline in aircraft deliveries and compensation it paid to airlines for a temporary grounding of Max 9s. The Max was Boeing’s answer to Airbus’ A320 family of planes.', 'Airbus, which is registered in the Netherlands but has its main headquarters in France, is taking a conspicuously cautious and even modest stance toward its recent success and its rival’s woes. CEO Guillaume Faury has said he’s “not happy” about Boeing’s troubles and they’re not good for the industry as a whole.', 'In an April 25 call with journalists, Faury was reserved about how much the company could speed up production, even with 8.7 billion euros in cash on hand. Airbus was managing “a diversity of challenges” in getting the parts it needs, he said, and must “make sure that we ramp up at a pace that is compatible with the weakest suppliers.”', 'Faury stressed that any moves to expand production would be done with an eye to “our core pillars of safety, quality, integrity, compliance and security.”', ""Airbus and Boeing have manufacturing constraints in part because the two companies are not so much aircraft makers as “aircraft assemblers” that rely on thousands of parts made by other companies, from the fuselage and engines to electronics and interiors, Alton Aviation's Berger noted. Since “the supply chains are going as fast as they can,” Airbus is not in a position to swoop in and take Boeing's customers."", 'The European company scored a symbolic win, however, when United Airlines lined up leases for 35 Airbus jets because of delays that Boeing faces in getting its new, larger Max 10 approved by U.S. regulators.', 'Given that, “Airbus is playing it well. They’re being very, very humble. It’s smart because they can’t exploit it,” Berger said.', 'Airbus last year topped Boeing for the fifth straight year in the orders race, with 2,094 net orders and 735 delivered planes. Boeing had 1,314 net orders and delivered 528 aircraft.', ""Airbus currently leads Boeing in sales of large single-aisle planes 80%-20%, according to figures from Alton Aviation Consultancy. The matchup between the smaller Airbus A320 and Boeing’s 737 Max 7 and Max 8 is more even; Airbus is ahead on delivered planes but Boeing is ahead 54%-46% when the European company's order backlog is counted."", ""Airbus' success is not just due to Boeing's missteps. The company is benefiting from its decision to launch the A321neo, a single-aisle aircraft with 180 to 230 seats. “Neo” stands for new engine option, meaning highly fuel efficient engines that save airlines money on one of their biggest costs. Boeing rushed to match with the Max, a 737 equipped with new, more efficient engines, only to run into trouble with the crashes and door plug."", 'Airbus also benefited from a deal to take over the smaller A220 developed by Canada’s Bombardier. Boeing is without a competing product in that niche. Analysts say Airbus has a further edge with the forthcoming A321XLR, a model that will allow airlines to use cheaper narrow-body jets on long-haul flights.', 'Yet the company already has pushed its deadline to produce 75 A320 and A321 jets per month from 2025 to 2026, and it moved the promised delivery date for the A321XLR from the second quarter of 2024 to the third.', '“Boeing is winning some orders because Airbus can’t supply the airplanes,” Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company consultancy, said. “So Airbus really can’t gain much more in the way of market share because they are sold out.”', ""The current pace of production at the two companies means older, less fuel-efficient planes are going to have to fly longer before being retired so airlines won't be able to reduce fuel costs. And older planes require more maintenance to keep flying, which costs money but doesn’t affect safety if the maintenance is done right. For travelers, it means discounted tickets will be harder to come by."", 'Could another entrant shake up the duopoly, as Tesla did for autos? Not for years to come, analysts said.', ""Brazil's Embraer makes smaller regional jets, and so far has not moved to compete with Boeing and Airbus. China’s COMAC has taken more than 1,000 orders for its narrow-body C919 plane but is “at least a decade or two” away from presenting a strong competitor, according to Berger."", 'That means a two-company race remains the game for now - even if one of them is under-performing.', '“The airlines need at least two,” Berger said. “They don’t want to put themselves in a monopolistic situation. So everybody’s cheering for Boeing to get their act together.”', '___', 'AP Airlines Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this story.']"

This morning, we reported our first quarter of 2024 results, which included double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings for share and strong cash flow demonstrating an overall good start to the year. Total backlog at quarter end was $29.9 billion, which we believe reflects the value of our collaborative client relationships and evidences the momentum we see for 2024. Utilities across the United States are experiencing and forecasting meaningful increases in power demand for the first time in many years, driven by the adoption of new technologies and related infrastructure, including artificial intelligence and data centers as well as federal and state policies that designed to accelerate the energy transition and policies intended to strategically reinforce domestic manufacturing and supply chain resources.', 'With the complexities of the power grid and the significant upgrades and enhancements required to facilitate low growth, our collaborative solution based approach is valued by our clients more than ever.

With our positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market.

Of note, we generated healthy cash flows in the first quarter with cash flow from operations of $238 million and free cash flow of $181.2 million. Both settings first quarter records.

It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$6.6b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Southern surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$1.03 per share, a notable 14% above expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Southern ', ""Following the latest results, Southern's 15 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$27.0b in 2024. This would be a credible 6.0% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$3.88, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$27.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.99 in 2024. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts."", 'It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$75.42, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Southern at US$85.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$66.00. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.', ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Southern's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 8.1% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 6.2% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 3.7% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Southern to grow faster than the wider industry."", 'The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$75.42, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.', 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$92.51. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider bought shares at close to current prices.

Skyworks Solutions insiders own about US$51m worth of shares. That equates to 0.4% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector and its outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', '2023 didn’t start out very rosy for the financial sector, marked by the sudden collapses of notable regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. These downfalls were specifically concerning because of their widespread impacts, affecting various geographical regions. Bank shares remained under pressure throughout 2023, but they experienced a notable surge toward the end of October. This was fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would conclude its campaign of raising interest rates without causing a recession. Financials ended up finishing the year with positive returns, with the S&P 500 Financials delivering a 12.15% return to shareholders.', 'That said, since high-interest rates are still at play, the financial sector is not completely out of the dangers it suffered from in the spring of 2023. As CNBC reported, the Federal Reserve hasn’t started lowering its main interest rate, because of which banks still have massive amounts of unrealized losses from bonds and loans with low-interest rates on their financial records. This, along with possible losses from commercial real estate, puts large parts of the banking sector at risk. The report further mentioned that over 280 US banks, collectively holding nearly $900 billion in assets, face potential capital needs due to high levels of exposure to commercial real estate and losses related to interest rates.', 'Many financial analysts anticipate rate cuts in 2024 that could mainly influence the performance of bank stocks. Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo discussed the outlooked with Bloomberg and said:', '“There are a number of factors that can impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior and competitive behavior, to name just a few. All of which we have little to no control over.”', 'As a result of this, some of the biggest banks such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) have been crystal ball gazing and predicting declines in their net interest income(NII) for 2024. On the other hand, we saw how high-interest rates last year were beneficial for the biggest banks as they managed to amass $253 billion in NII, marking an increase of approximately $80 billion compared to the total in 2021. S&P Global also expects NII to decline in 2024, however, the firm also anticipates that banks will achieve a return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11% and will build their capital reserves by retaining earnings.', 'Financial companies are also known for paying dividends to shareholders. In fact, if we look at the recent data, we get to know that nearly half of the global increases in dividend payouts in 2023 originated from banks, exceeding their share in the total dividend payments, which is one-sixth, according to a report by Janus Henderson. The report also mentioned that the significant 15% rise, reaching a record $220 billion, primarily came from banks’ improved profitability due to the normalization of interest rates following years of loose monetary policies. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks from the financial sector.', 'Pixabay/Public Domain', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector.

Buying stocks can still be a smart move, especially if you\'re a long-term investor.', ""Three Motley Fool contributors have identified stocks they think are no-brainers to buy in May. Here's why they picked Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX)."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): What makes a stock a no-brainer? Excellent financial results, a competitive advantage, or a long runway for growth? The answer is all of those things and more. And Eli Lilly, one of the world's largest healthcare companies, is outstanding in all three categories. In the first quarter, the company's revenue grew by 26% year over year to $8.8 billion, a fantastic performance for a pharmaceutical giant."", ""On the bottom line, the drugmaker's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) landed at $2.58, 59% higher than the year-ago period. Analysts expect Eli Lilly's EPS to grow by an average 50% annually over the next five years. What about the company's competitive advantage? Eli Lilly is one of the leading experts in developing diabetes and obesity medicines. It has a long track record of success in this area. Its most important product, tirzepatide, first earned approval in 2022."", ""It will benefit from patent protection well into the 2030s and significantly contribute to Eli Lilly's top-line growth. That also highlights the growth opportunities available to Eli Lilly. Tirzepatide is indicated to treat diabetes and obesity, with the latter market expected to skyrocket. Eli Lilly's lineup extends far beyond this one product. The company's pipeline is equally exciting. That's why it continues to crush the market but is far from having hit a ceiling. There is plenty of upside left for Eli Lilly, which makes it a great stock to buy in May."", ""David Jagielski (Pfizer): The one healthcare stock that I wouldn't hesitate to buy this month is Pfizer. The stock is incredibly cheap, it pays a dividend, and it's still one of the safest healthcare investments you can own. Whether investors are overly bearish because of the lack of growth it's expecting this year or just being overly punitive on the stock because of waning vaccine demand is irrelevant; investors can get some excellent value by buying the stock right now."", ""There are multiple metrics that help to highlight what kind of a deal Pfizer's stock is. It's trading at 12 times its estimated future profit and 1.7 times its book value, and its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is well below 1. Although investors are right to discount the stock given future uncertainty and the patent cliffs some of its top drugs are facing in the years ahead, the selloff has become extreme; Pfizer's stock is trading at levels it hasn't been at in more than a decade."", 'This truly could be a once-in-a-decade buying opportunity for investors. Pfizer is expecting minimal revenue growth this year but through acquisitions, including its purchase of Seagen last year and developing its pipeline, it expects to add $25 billion in annual new product sales by the end of the decade.', ""It may not be an easy path forward for the healthcare company, but given the significantly reduced price tag the stock trades at, it's easy to justify loading up on Pfizer's shares today. And as a bonus to the potential upside, the stock also pays a dividend that yields 6.2%."", 'Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Only one company markets drugs that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic disease. That company is Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Vertex should have plenty of growth in the CF indication, especially with the company planning to file for regulatory approvals this summer for what could be its most powerful CF therapy yet.', ""However, as lucrative as Vertex's monopoly in CF is, I'm even more excited about the huge new markets that could potentially be on the way. The big biotech already has an approved product in two of those markets. Gene-editing therapy Casgevy is a one-and-done functional cure for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia."", 'Another massive market could open up to Vertex soon. The company recently submitted the first module of its rolling U.S. regulatory submission of suzetrigine (VX-548) in treating acute pain. It expects to complete this filing by the end of the second quarter of 2024. Acute pain is a multibillion-dollar market with significant unmet need. Suzetrigine should have major commercial potential filling the gap between safe but less effective anti-inflammatory medications and highly addictive opioids.', ""Looking a little farther down the road, Vertex has a huge opportunity with inaxaplin in treating APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). There's currently no approved therapy for treating the underlying cause of AMKD. The disease affects around 100,000 patients worldwide compared to an estimated 92,000 CF patients. Vertex is evaluating inaxaplin in a phase 3 clinical study."", ""Want more? Vertex plans to acquire Alpine Immune Sciences for around $4.9 billion. This deal will bring povetacicept into Vertex's pipeline. Alpine is on track to advance the experimental therapy into a phase 3 study in the second half of this year targeting IgA nephropathy, a kidney disease that affects 130,000 patients in the U.S. Like AMKD, there are no approved therapies treating the underlying cause of IgA nephropathy."", ""Vertex could have five new multibillion-dollar therapies within the next few years -- and we're just talking about its recently approved and late-stage programs. The big biotech's pipeline also features several promising early stage programs, notably including a potential cure for type 1 diabetes."", 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

(NYSE:PFE) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Pfizer investors that purchase the stock on or after the 9th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of June."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.42 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.68 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Pfizer has a trailing yield of 6.0% on the current stock price of US$27.81. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Pfizer has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for Pfizer ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Pfizer lost money last year, so the fact that it's paying a dividend is certainly disconcerting. There might be a good reason for this, but we'd want to look into it further before getting comfortable. With the recent loss, it's important to check if the business generated enough cash to pay its dividend. If Pfizer didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. Pfizer paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 193%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", 'Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Pfizer reported a loss last year, but at least the general trend suggests its income has been improving over the past five years. Even so, an unprofitable company whose business does not quickly recover is usually not a good candidate for dividend investors.', ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Pfizer has increased its dividend at approximately 5.8% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth."", 'We update our analysis on Pfizer every 24 hours, so you can always get the latest insights on its financial health, here.', 'Has Pfizer got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? First, it\'s not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. Second, the dividend was not well covered by cash flow."" It\'s not that we think Pfizer is a bad company, but these characteristics don\'t generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.', ""With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Pfizer don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business.

One way new investors have been gaining exposure to the cryptocurrency is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as earlier in the year, regulators approved many spot Bitcoin ETFs.', ""These ETFs track Bitcoin and give investors direct exposure to its price movements. That means that they aren't necessarily going to provide you with safer, less volatile options for investing in Bitcoin. You will still be vulnerable to wild swings in the crypto market."", ""Instead, you may want to consider investing in stocks that have strong underlying businesses and exposure to Bitcoin. Two such examples are Block (NYSE: SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL).

While Block doesn't generate strong margins on Bitcoin transactions, the company still posted a profit overall last year with net income totaling $9.8 million."", ""The company's Cash App makes it easy for people to buy and sell Bitcoin. And Block is going even deeper into crypto as it plans to build its own Bitcoin mining system.

With a diversified and profitable business, it's easy to track the company's performance and growth; it's a less speculative investment than crypto can be. While investors will still face risks with the stock, given how much of a factor Bitcoin plays in Block's operations, it could make for a better overall investment option."", 'The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 0.9, suggesting that this could possibly be a cheap option for growth investors to hang onto for the long haul.', ""PayPal also allows users to buy and sell crypto, but its operations are smaller, and it doesn't have an entire segment devoted to Bitcoin-related revenue the way Block does. In that sense, PayPal may be an even safer option for investors. However, it is still clearly bullish on crypto, as it has launched its own stablecoin, PayPal USD, which it says is designed for payments."", ""Unlike with Block, investors have come to expect consistent profits from PayPal. The big knock on the business has been simply that its growth rate has been underwhelming. But it's a fairly safe option for crypto enthusiasts."", 'The payment processing company released its earnings on Tuesday and its revenue for the first three months of the year totaled $7.7 billion, rising by 9% year over year. Net income of $888 million also increased by 12% when compared to the same period last year.', 'PayPal is another decently valued stock, as it trades at only 13 times its expected future profits (based on analyst expectations) and its PEG ratio is around 0.6.

While traditional computers process data as binary ""bits"" of zeros and ones, quantum computers process zeros and ones simultaneously as ""qubits."" That approach makes quantum computers much faster than their traditional counterparts, but they\'re larger, more expensive, and more prone to making mistakes.', 'As quantum computing technologies improve, those systems should gradually become smaller, cheaper, and more accurate. This makes them ideal for processing complex machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.', 'According to Acumen Research and Consulting, the quantum computing market could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% from 2023 to 2032 -- and early movers like IBM and IonQ could benefit from that secular expansion. But should you invest in the blue-chip stalwart or the speculative newcomer?', ""IBM deployed the world's first quantum computing system as a cloud-based service in 2016. Since then, it's deployed more than 80 quantum systems which are used to run over 3 trillion programs on a daily basis. It also recently installed its Quantum System One system at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. This is the first-ever installation of an IBM quantum system on a college campus."", 'IBM operates its quantum computing business as a freemium extension of its cloud ecosystem. It doesn\'t disclose the exact revenue separately, but it\'s likely insignificant compared to its larger software, infrastructure, and consulting businesses. In its latest 10-Q filing, IBM refers to quantum computing as one of its ""next set of business opportunities.""', 'So for now, investors should focus more on IBM\'s expansion of its hybrid cloud and AI platforms to offset the slower growth of its legacy software and hardware businesses. To drive that transformation, IBM divested its slower-growth managed infrastructure services unit as Kyndryl in late 2021, expanded its subsidiary Red Hat to wedge more open-source AI services between the public and private clouds, and restructured its business into three simpler units -- software, consulting, and infrastructure -- to generate ""mid-single digit revenue growth"" from 2022 to 2024.', ""That strategy has paid off. IBM's revenue and adjusted EPS rose 6% in 2022 and 2% in 2023. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 4% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 6%. Those growth rates are steady, its stock looks reasonably valued at 19 times forward earnings, and it pays a hefty forward yield of 4%."", 'IBM\'s individual quantum computing units (QPUs) are several feet wide. IonQ is trying to shrink those QPUs to just a few inches wide with its ""trapped ion"" technology.', 'Unlike IBM, IonQ is a pure play on the quantum computing market which generates all of its revenue from its quantum computing systems. It provides its quantum computing power as a cloud-based service to the U.S. military and large enterprise customers, and it gauges its total computing power in its proprietary algorithm qubits (AQ) metric. It reached AQ 29 in 2023, AQ 36 this January, and it plans to achieve AQ 64 by 2025.', 'At AQ 64, it claims its platform would be ""100,000 times larger than the limit of a classical supercomputer simulation."" Looking further ahead, it aims to hit AQ 256 in 2026, AQ 384 in 2027, and AQ 1,024 in 2028. It believes it can achieve that rapid expansion by consistently miniaturizing its QPUs.', ""IonQ's revenue rose from $2 million in 2021 to $11 million in 2022, then doubled to $22 million in 2023. Analysts expect its revenue to hit $153 million in 2026 -- which would represent a CAGR of 91% from 2023.

Back in 2022, the short seller Scorpion Capital accused IonQ of exaggerating its miniaturization capabilities and secretly using third-party quantum computers from Honeywell to provide its cloud-based processing services. A few months later, Dr. Chris Monroe -- the company's chief science officer who had developed the trapped ion technology which its entire growth strategy was built upon -- abruptly resigned."", ""IBM is growing slower than IonQ and hasn't generated significant revenue from its quantum computing systems yet. However, it's firmly profitable and supporting the future growth of its quantum computing systems by expanding its core businesses. As IBM locks in more enterprise customers, it will become easier to deploy its newer quantum systems."", ""IonQ's technology sounds promising, but it's richly valued, racking up steep losses, and faces troubling questions regarding its secretive miniaturization technologies. It might successfully scale up its quantum computing systems, but it's still too speculative for my tastes.

I will now turn the call over to Jeff.', ""Jeff Guldner : Thanks, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. 2024 started off in line with the financial guidance that we provided on the fourth quarter call in February. And before Andrew discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent operational and on regulatory developments. With the temperatures in Arizona quickly heating up, we're focused on executing our robust summer preparedness program with the resource adequacy continuing to be extremely important as energy demands increase and energy supplies in the Southwest tightens. To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, we work year round on operational preparedness, resource planning, procuring sufficient reserve margins, creating customer partnerships to manage peak demand and maintaining a comprehensive fire mitigation program."", ""In fact, as we head into the wildfire season, the company is taking further action to protect our customers and our communities from the risk of wildfires. Our comprehensive fire mitigation strategy includes three key categories to ensure defense and depth. First, we have a robust vegetation management program, including creating defensible space around poles and infrastructure, and strong coordination with forest management officials around the state. Second, we deploy technology that's targeted at managing wildfire risk, and that includes weather stations, cameras, remote control, sectionalizing devices and advanced risk modeling software. And third, we apply several risk-informed operating protocols, such as specific requirements for how our crews work safely in fire-prone areas, in addition to new protocols such as Power Safety and Public Safety Power Shutoffs or PSPS."", ""While PSPS is a new protocol for our program, we've been working on this implementation following last summer, and we've partnered with local communities first responders and state officials to ensure that our customers are informed and know what to expect. We've had community workshops and have invested a lot in customer communications to ensure that this is a transparent process. We're committed to actively taking steps to prevent wildfires and to safeguard the communities that we serve, while continuing to learn from operating experience developed throughout our industry. Turning to our operational preparedness. It's extremely important that our generation units are ready for the summer. We're in the final stages of our planned maintenance activities for our thermal units ahead of the summer period to ensure our system is ready to serve."", ""In addition, Palo Verde's Unit 3 is currently in a planned refueling outage that began on April 6, and it's on schedule to return to service in early May. Upon the successful completion of the latest refueling outage, all three units are poised to provide around the clock clean energy to help meet the demand for the summer for the entire Desert Southwest. I'm also proud to say that we're starting this year with J.D. Power residential customer satisfaction survey scores that place APS within the first quartile for overall satisfaction when compared to its large investor-owned peers. APS made gains in every category, including power quality and reliability, price, corporate citizenship, billing and payment, communications and customer care, both digital and phone in the first quarter."", ""Results like this take the dedication and the commitment of all employees across the company, and we look forward to continuing to make improvements for our customers and providing a more frictionless experience. Turning to regulatory. We've successfully implemented the rate case outcome on March 8 for our customers. The commission recently voted to hold a narrow rehearing on our rate case that's limited to the grid access charge, that charge is a rate design issue where the commission had increased the revenue allocation to distributed generation solar customers to better align their rates with cost to service. The commission intends, I think, to further examine whether the grid excess charge is just unreasonable and we'll be participating in those proceedings."", ""Additionally, the commission has turned its focus to the regulatory lag docket. The first workshop was held on March 19, with multiple stakeholders presenting a variety of options on how to holistically address regulatory lag and interested parties have been invited to file written comments into the docket and the commission has voiced their intent of having further workshops that will be noticed in the future. We look forward to continuing to work with the commission and with other stakeholders on addressing regulatory lag in Arizona. Although, 2024 is off to a solid start, we know we have much to do still, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our priorities throughout the year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew."", 'Andrew Cooper: Thank you, Jeff and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our first quarter 2024 financial results. I will review those results and provide additional details on weather, sales and guidance. In the first quarter of 2024, we achieved earnings of $0.15 per share compared to a loss of $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2023. This improvement was driven by several key factors: the sale of Bright Canyon Energy, the implementation of new rates on March 8 along with increases in adjusted revenue, and finally robust customer and sales growth. These positive impacts were partially offset by milder year-over-year weather and increases in interest expense depreciation and amortization and L&M.', 'The Bright Canyon Energy transaction provided a onetime benefit of $0.15 per share this quarter. This follows the initial phase of the sale completed in the third quarter of last year. In addition as Jeff mentioned we successfully implemented new rates for our customers in March and are seeing a benefit from these new revenues. Turning to weather. Although conditions in the first three months of this year were normal, we experienced a drag of $0.07 per share year-over-year. This drag can be attributed to the exceptionally cold start in 2023, which was one of the coldest in the Phoenix Metro area since 1979 and to March 2023 being the coldest March in over three decades. Customer growth for the quarter came in as expected at 1.8% and consistent with our guidance range of 1.5% to 2.5%.', ""Our weather-normalized sales growth came in at 5.9% for the quarter driven by robust C&I growth. Because first quarter is historically a smaller quarter for the company, we're still expecting our weather-normalized sales growth to come in within our existing guidance range of 2% to 3% for the year. Arizona's economy remains a diverse release growth in Investment hub. A prominent example of this vibrant economic activity is Taiwan Semiconductor, which recently announced a $25 billion increase to the previously announced $40 billion investment in Arizona for a total of $65 billion. TSMC announced plans to build a third facility by the end of the decade and the facilities are now expected to employ more than 6,000 workers of which TSMC has already hired over 2,000."", 'In addition, there continues to be sustained interest for additional data center and manufacturing development within our service territory. Although these developments are outside of our current three-year sales growth guidance they represent significant long-term opportunities for earnings growth and the potential for enhanced cost efficiency for all our customers. Residential growth in our region has been consistently strong. Maricopa County was recognized by the US Census Bureau as the fourth largest growing county in the nation in 2023 welcoming over 30,000 new residents. This ongoing influx of residents underscores the need for continuous investment in our infrastructure to ensure reliable service for all our customers. Our current capital expenditure and financing plans are designed to meet these expanding demands effectively.', 'O&M was a slight drag compared to Q1 2023. The impact was less than expected primarily due to delays in procuring essential materials needed for planned maintenance work at our power plants. These delays are expected to shift the timing of certain costs from first to second quarter. Despite ongoing inflationary pressures and the costs associated with supporting our expanding customer base, we remain committed to our 2024 O&M guidance which is a year-over-year reduction in core expense. Interest expense was higher this quarter compared to the first quarter of last year driven by increased interest rates and higher debt balances and we continue to monitor the actions of the Federal Reserve. In addition, our depreciation and amortization expense is higher as one of two large planned information technology products went into service this quarter.', 'These projects are extremely important to make sure we have updated systems and the tools necessary to reliably serve our customers. Due to the shorter depreciation schedule for IT projects, we expect these expenses to create meaningful drag throughout the year and have already accounted for them in our annual guidance. After the constructive wreck case outcome we successfully completed our planned equity offering of about $750 million of common stock and a forward sale. We will determine the most opportune time to settle the forward sale agreements and invest the funds into the utility to maintain a healthy and sustainable capital structure. In addition, the rating agencies have completed their reviews of our ratings and importantly, all three rating agencies have resolved our outlook from negative to stable.', ""Moody's and Fitch downgraded Pinnacle West ratings by one notch, with Moody's downgrading APS ratings one notch as well and we are now similarly rated by all three agencies. We continue to focus on reducing regulatory lag and sustaining our targeted cash flow metrics with adequate cushion to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings for the benefit of our customers. Finally, we are reaffirming all other guidance provided on the fourth quarter call and look forward to continuing to execute our strategy and reliably serving our customers as we head into the upcoming summer season. This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."", 'See also', '12 Cheap Lithium Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and', '30 Most Profitable Companies with Highest Margins in the World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Yes, it’s a boring sector but there’s a method to the madness.', 'First, the sector represents the real economy; that is, it’s where the rubber meets the road, literally and figuratively. Sure, the initial crash is painful for this and other industries. However, once the economy – because it always does – the transportation sector may be one of the first to experience gains.', 'Second and on a related note, the ecosystem enjoys permanent relevance.

On that note, below are transportation stocks to buy.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Wangkun Jia / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top transportation stocks to buy, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) provides rail-based freight transportation services. Per its public profile, CSX specializes in the transporting of intermodal containers and trailers along with other sector-related services. These include rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations. While shares got off to a solid start earlier this year, in the past month, CSX stock slipped almost 8%.', 'Financially, the company isn’t setting new performance benchmarks. However, it is a consistent player, doing what it needs to. In the past four quarters, CSX’s average positive earnings surprise comes out to 1.13%. Profitability is one of the core strengths, with the company delivering a net margin of 24.75%. That’s above 88.79% of the competition.', 'Still, in fairness, investors are paying for the consistency, with a forward earnings multiple of 17.42X. That’s above the sector median 12.82X. Nevertheless, analysts anticipate a high-side earnings per share of $2.02. That’s a decent lift from last year’s result of $1.85.

While KNX stock is a relevant idea, it’s also risky. Since the start of the year, shares stumbled more than 18%. Nevertheless, for speculators targeting a big discount, KNX could soon be intriguing.', 'To be fair, the company has been all over the map in terms of its financial performance. For example, in the first quarter of this year, Knight-Swift posted EPS of 12 cents. That was well off the expected print of 20 cents. So, the red ink is justified. Still, with shares getting a beating, KNX is now trading at 1.07X book value. That seems a little light.', 'True, the expected EPS for fiscal 2024 only comes out to $1.45. That’s a far cry from the anticipated $1.72. Still, the most optimistic analyst believes EPS of $2.53 is possible. For fiscal 2025, this bottom-line metric could rise to $3.99.

That said, businesses evolve, FedEx courier services – such as its overnight deliveries – could witness demand expansion.', 'Of course, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) investing in its own delivery service, the matter has clouded FedEx and its rivals. Still, it’s also possible that the burgeoning gig economy could boost sales for FedEx. The company’s performance over the past four quarters reflects that FDX isn’t entirely a lost cause. Even with an earnings miss in the quarter ended Nov. 30, the average quarterly surprise came out to 7.6%.', 'Currently, FDX trades at 12.24X forward earnings, which is decent. That’s with an expected EPS target of $17.80 by the end of fiscal 2024. It’s also possible that on the high end, EPS could land at $18.10 and $23.30 in fiscal 2025.

The S&P 500 is up an uninspired 5.5% year to date, and investors are waiting for good news about the economy."", ""Some of that news has been arriving with several solid company earnings reports.

It's a great way to get insight into the companies that are worth your investing dollars."", ""Going through Warren Buffett's picks is an excellent starting point. Visa (NYSE: V), American Express (NYSE: AXP), and Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) are three top stocks worth exploring right now."", ""Investors often cite Visa's strength as an indicator of the overall economy. When the economy is growing, so is Visa, and vice versa. Since the economy grows more often than not, Visa performs well an overwhelming majority of the time."", 'That makes sense. Visa is the largest credit card network in the world, with 4.4 billion cards in circulation, more than $15 trillion in trailing-12-month payment volume, and partnerships with 14,500 financial institutions. When shoppers make purchases, Visa gets a fee every time one of its cards is swiped.', 'Despite the current economic volatility, Visa is reporting strong performance. In the 2024 fiscal second quarter, revenue and net income both increased 10% year over year. It expects that to continue for the remainder of the year, guiding for revenue to increase in the low double digits for both the third quarter and the full year.', ""But it's more than the simple swipe that makes Visa so compelling. It has built up its moat through acquisitions and partnerships, ensuring that it keeps its top spot. It has developed robust technology and digital capabilities, and as much as it's the epitome of the traditional payment network, it's also a competitive fintech leader."", 'Visa is doing well despite economic uncertainty and will do even better when the economy gets back on track. Now is a great time to buy and benefit from a potential economic recovery.', 'American Express is a Visa competitor but has a different model, operating a ""closed-loop"" system. Instead of partnering with financial institutions that underwrite the credit part of a purchase, American Express acts as its own underwriting bank. It also offers a large suite of financial services for individuals and businesses and has a target market of affluent customers who pay annual fees for most of its cards.', ""In its core credit card processing business, American Express' performance mirrors the economy. But it has the added edge of a consumer base that has more discretionary income to spend at any time and is more resilient than the mass shopper when there's pressure. It also has more revenue streams than Visa, which could be one of the reasons it's one of Buffett's favorite stocks."", 'Revenue increased 11% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, and net income jumped 34%. Management is guiding for similar results for full-year revenue growth and about a 15% rise in earnings per share.', 'American Express and its stock will benefit from an improved economy in much the same way as Visa will. Its banking segment will also get a boost when interest rates are lowered.', ""Nu is the rare Buffett growth stock\xa0and has been demonstrating phenomenal growth since it went public in 2021. It's a Brazil-based bank that's all digital, and its easy-to-use interface and low fees have been attracting millions of new customers."", ""The bank's headquarters are in Brazil, where more than half of the adult population is already on its platform. It's also in Mexico and Colombia, where it's just getting started and growth rates are even higher."", 'Customer accounts increased by 19.3 million year over year to 93.9 million in the 2023 fourth quarter.

Average revenue per active customer (ARPAC) continues to steadily increase, from $8.20 to $10.60 year over year in the fourth quarter. As these customers engage with Nu's platform at higher rates, profitability increases."", ""Nu is a young company and has massive growth potential.

Such investments are often worth the trouble regardless of whether you're investing for the dividend, or for making capital gains from the robust business (always a laudable goal). But here's the common thread that runs through outstanding dividend stocks: Companies that grow their dividend payouts over extended periods time all have solid fundamentals."", ""The obvious corollary is, not every dividend payer on the market is worth investing in. But let's consider two that are: Novartis (NYSE: NVS) and Visa (NYSE: V)."", ""What makes a drugmaker like Novartis a great dividend stock is its portfolio of lifesaving medicines that physicians will continue prescribing regardless of economic conditions. That translates into steady revenue and profits, irrespective of economic expansions and recessions, for the pharmaceutical giant. Moreover, the need for innovative therapies isn't going to subside anytime soon. In fact, it will only increase over the long run as the world's population ages."", ""Novartis is a highly innovative company that has shown the ability to launch new drugs that benefit from patent protection for up to 20 years in the United States, an important competitive advantage. However, one of Novartis' most important products, psoriasis treatment Cosentyx, will run out of patent protection by 2026. Last year, Cosentyx generated nearly $5 billion in sales, a 5% year-over-year increase."", ""Fortunately, Novartis should be able to handle this patent cliff. Its biggest growth driver, heart failure medicine Entresto, is still going strong, generating a revenue of $6 billion in 2023, 30% higher than in 2022. Further, newer approvals like Fabhalta should help smooth out Cosentyx's declining sales, once that starts happening. Fabhalta earned regulatory approval in December as a treatment for a rare blood disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, with some analysts predicting peak sales of as much as $3.6 billion."", ""Based on its past record, Novartis should continue to make clinical and regulatory progress. That's why the drugmaker has sustained its strong dividend program for so long. Novartis has increased its payout for 27 consecutive years, an impressive track record. The dividend yields 3.9% with a reasonable cash payout ratio just under 51%. Novartis' dividend looks secure for the long haul."", ""Visa has a fantastic business model. The company's payment network facilitates credit card transactions and charges a fee for every one of them. However, Visa is insulated from credit risk since it does not issue credit cards itself. It merely serves as an intermediary between issuing banks and businesses trying to collect payments from consumers. There are several other aspects of Visa's business worth mentioning."", ""Consider the company's network effect: the more consumers join its ecosystem (by having Visa-branded credit cards), the more attractive it becomes to businesses. That's why Visa is one of the two undisputed leaders in its industry. It is difficult to find companies that don't accept Visa as a form of payment. In most developed countries, that would amount to turning down millions of potential customers."", ""The company's reach and position are so entrenched that it is difficult to see the company being knocked off its pedestal anytime soon. Furthermore, Visa benefits from high margins because it already has a well-established payment network, and additional transactions do not increase the costs of producing its main service. That translates into strong operating and net profits."", ""Visa will thrive so long as the number of transactions conducted under its banner increases. And on that front, things are looking good. The company is still looking to phase out cash and check transactions, which, despite appearances, are still widespread. Visa is far from having peaked. That is unlikely to happen in the next decade. Visa's dividend growth has been impressive over the past 10 years, increasing by 420%."", ""Its dividend yield of 0.77% and cash payout ratio of 20% indicate that, if anything, the company has the means to raise its dividend substantially without being at risk of running out of cash. That's why investors can safely hold this dividend stock for the next 10 years."", 'Before you buy stock in Novartis Ag, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Novartis Ag wasn’t one of them.

In the meantime, credit-scoring technology company VantageScore says that loan delinquencies fell last month, the first decrease since May 2021. The average credit score improved as well."", ""This implies that people are getting a better handle on their debt.

Indeed, it's not a stretch to suggest the Coca-Cola name has been sewn into the fabric of our culture."", ""Buffett's interest in the company is much more pragmatic, though. Coca-Cola's branding and marketing firepower is just a means to an end. And that end is cash flow -- an ever-growing amount of it."", ""While there are faster-growing companies out there, there aren't many growing as consistently as Coca-Cola's been able to beef up its bottom line.

Neither was the company's decision to not lower its full-year guidance, as some investors expected it to -- Visa still anticipates sales growth rates in the low double digits for the remainder of the year, in line with its results thus far."", ""The stock's sinking anyway.\xa0Chalk it up to worries over new credit card regulations, which limit the size of late fees that card issuers can charge. Record-breaking credit card balances aren't helping either, as they seemingly leave the company less room for growth. Then there's the impending merger of rivals Discover and Capital One, which will make for a more formidable competitor."", ""These worries are all more bark than bite, however. Visa has pushed through bigger challenges. And it will do so again, this time by capitalizing on its strengths like payment-tech innovation and its sheer reach. Visa handles a market-leading 40% of the planet's card-based transactions. It matters simply because it's much easier to remain in the lead than it is to take the lead."", ""Berkshire owns a little over 8 million shares of Visa that are collectively worth $2.2 billion, by the way.

Over the past three years, it has declined by 30% in value. As a result of that sell-off, the stock's dividend yield is up to 6.6%, which is far higher than normal for the business. Typically, the stock yields around 4%."", ""Are the stock's struggles a sign that the company is in trouble, and that its yield is unsustainable? Or have the markets overreacted to the current economic conditions, and could Verizon simply be one of the best bargains out there for income investors?"", ""Verizon released its latest quarterly numbers on April 22. For the first three months of 2024, the telecom company's operating revenue was flat at $33 billion. Its consolidated net income of $4.7 billion was also lower than the $5 billion it reported a year earlier. The one encouraging number, however, was the free cash flow. At $2.7 billion for the quarter, it was higher than the $2.3 billion in free cash that Verizon generated in the prior-year period."", 'Nonetheless, CEO Hans Vestberg called the results ""strong"" and says that the company is on track to meet its guidance for the year. While some investors may debate that assessment of the performance, the company isn\'t exactly expecting a blowout year in 2024; Verizon\'s guidance calls for a 2% to 3.5% growth in wireless service revenue for the full year, and for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to rise between 1% and 3%.', ""Overall, it wasn't a great quarter, but given the circumstances (i.e., people cutting back on spending due to inflation), it wasn't a shocking result for Verizon, either."", ""Dividend investors will want to focus on the payout ratio. And last quarter, Verizon's earnings per share totaled $1.09. That's far higher than the $0.665 that the company pays in dividends each quarter. It means that it's currently paying out about 61% of its profits back to shareholders in the form of dividend payments."", ""Another way to analyze the dividend is to look at cash flow. Free cash flow is what the business has available, after capital expenditures, to either reinvest back into its operations or to distribute to shareholders in the form of dividends. Last quarter, the company paid out $2.8 billion in cash dividends. That is slightly more than the $2.7 billion it reported in free cash flow. It's not a huge gap, and cash flow can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of bill payments and the collection of receivables, so it's not necessarily a huge issue at this point."", ""Overall, there isn't any big cause for concern with respect to Verizon's dividend. The business is steady, and although the growth rate may be underwhelming, the company is still doing well amid the current economic conditions."", ""Verizon offers investors a good yield and with the stock trading at less than 9 times its estimated future earnings, based on analyst expectations. In other words, there's some good value here. Verizon's also trading at just 1.8 times its book value, and even when factoring in its estimated future growth, its price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of 1.1 also suggests it's a very reasonably priced stock to own."", ""Once interest rates inevitably come down, Verizon's stock could become a much more popular buy than it is today. I think given its low valuation and high dividend, this is an investment worth adding to your portfolio. There's a good margin of safety here for risk-averse investors as well."", 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them.

Indeed, it benefits from being one of only three 5G providers, and the industry's massive fixed costs make it unlikely that additional competitors will enter it."", 'However, such costs have also burdened Verizon in other respects. Such conditions may lead to questions as to whether payout increases are sustainable.', 'In the first four months of the year, Verizon has returned around 9% to investors. A portion of the return is dividends. At an annual payout of $2.66 per share, shareholders earn a dividend yield of 6.7% annually, or just under 1.7% so far this year.', 'The remainder comes from stock gains. Rising optimism about 5G and a P/E ratio, which now stands at around 15, have likely made Verizon stock an appealing alternative to higher-priced stocks in other parts of the tech industry.', 'Also, its peers, AT&T and T-Mobile, have only returned about 3%.', 'Nonetheless, when looking at a time period of one year or longer, T-Mobile remains the highest-performing stock. It stands out in two aspects. For one, it began as a wireless company, meaning it did not have the legacy wireline businesses that have become a burden to Verizon and AT&T.', ""Moreover, until last December, T-Mobile did not pay a dividend. In contrast, Verizon and AT&T have offered payouts since soon after the breakup from the original AT&T in the early 1980s. Additionally, the high cost of AT&T's dividend led to the company slashing its payout in 2022."", 'So far, Verizon has maintained its dividend, which includes a 17-year streak of payout hikes. Still, that comes at an annual cost of $11 billion per year.', ""Also, while Verizon did not make the strategic missteps that led to AT&T's dividend cut, it may have to consider slashing its payout due to one factor -- debt."", ""The total debt amounts to $152 billion. Not only has that increased slightly from last year, but it is significantly above Verizon's $96 billion in total equity, placing a tremendous burden on the company."", 'Worse, nearly $16 billion of that debt matures over the next year. Hence, with just over $2 billion in cash, it will likely have to refinance that debt at a higher interest rate. Interest expenses, which were $1.6 billion in the first quarter, rose 36% from last year, and with the increases unlikely to stop, Verizon could face a cash crunch.', 'Unfortunately for income investors, the obvious solution may be to slash the payout and allocate some or all of the $11 billion in annual dividend costs to reducing debt. That move will probably upset many of its investors.', 'Also, walking away from a long-term record of payout hikes will probably diminish confidence in the stock for at least a time. So, while that move may be good for the company, Verizon stock will almost certainly suffer in the short run and maybe beyond.', ""Given Verizon's financial state, investors should probably sell the stock. Admittedly, Verizon's network is critical to the tech industry, and the company is likely to remain a major 5G player."", 'However, its massive debt and rising interest rates place increasing strain on the balance sheet. In the end, an eventual dividend cut is probably unavoidable, making it likely the aforementioned outperformance is likely not sustainable.', 'If Verizon can reduce its debt, investors should reevaluate the stock.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Tapestry, Inc.

In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' View our latest analysis for Tapestry ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tapestry is:', '35% = US$928m ÷ US$2.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Tapestry has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Luxury industry.', ""That's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", 'Tapestry does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.91. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.', 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

Plus, they may feel overwhelmed by the variety of other choices to consider."", 'But the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) has all those bases covered. In addition to holding a large position in Nvidia, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF provides exposure to a variety of other AI-focused companies that stand to benefit from growth in generative AI, machine learning, and large language models.', ""It wasn't so long ago that people had little exposure to generative AI. Nowadays, it feels unavoidable. And it's nearly a certainty that its presence in our lives is going to continue ramping higher. In fact, many pundits predict that it's going to accelerate considerably. Business intelligence firm Markets and Markets projects the generative AI market will represent about $21 billion in 2024 and soar at a 37% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 when it will reach $137 billion."", 'Eager to benefit from the growth in generative AI, investors have unsurprisingly raced to Nvidia stock. A leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia helps data centers handle the tremendous computing demands that generative AI platforms place on them. With its recent rise, however, Nvidia stock is now trading at 69 times operating cash flow (OCF), making it unappealing for those looking to avoid high valuations.', 'Branding the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF as the ""world\'s first Generative AI ETF,"" Roundhill Investments, the manager of the fund, cites research from Goldman Sachs that estimates AI can contribute to $7 trillion in economic growth worldwide over the next 10 years.', 'With 46 holdings in the fund, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF offers investors wide exposure to leading companies that will drive the advancement of generative AI.

Rounding out the top-three positions, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are the second- and third-largest positions, respectively.', ""Whereas Nvidia makes the GPUs that help support generative AI computing, Microsoft is developing AI solutions such as Copilot, an AI assistant that integrates with several Microsoft products.

A generative AI application, Adobe's Firefly can be used across various Adobe products, such as Express, Photoshop, and Illustrator."", ""There's no denying that Nvidia stock is extremely alluring right now considering the company's position as a stalwart GPU developer, but it's hardly the only generative AI game in town. Investors cognizant of this fact -- and who are looking for comprehensive exposure to the industry -- therefore will want to pay particular attention to the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF, which provides a singular opportunity to gain broad exposure to generative AI.

However, predicting where a stock is going in two or three months can be tricky and can be affected by external events like the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy."", ""So instead, let's focus on where Nvidia may be in five years, taking a long-term view that focuses on how the business executes rather than short-term market sentiment."", ""Nvidia's incredible rise can be easily tied to one trend -- the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Creating AI models requires an incredible amount of computing power. But that's where Nvidia's GPUs come in. GPUs, or graphics processing units, allow many computations to occur in parallel, which is useful for AI model training. Furthermore, when companies buy GPUs, they don't just buy one or two; they buy them by the hundreds or thousands and connect them to a server to create an incredibly powerful computer."", ""These GPUs aren't cheap, either. Nvidia's current flagship GPU, the H100, costs around $30,000 apiece. So, with companies buying truckloads of GPUs at a time, Nvidia is seeing a massive benefit."", 'But the question many investors have is, ""When will this end?"" While I don\'t have the answer, I can tell you that GPUs don\'t last forever. GPU companies like Nvidia are always innovating, and in a few years, the GPUs that are cutting edge now will be slower and less efficient than the newer ones available. This will drive another upgrade cycle, and with Nvidia\'s GPUs being the most commonly used right now, there will be switching costs if customers decide to go with competitors\' products.', ""In 2022, UptimeInstitute found that 33% of organizations surveyed refreshed their servers every five years. That's up from 31% in 2020 and 20% in 2015. This time lengthening shows that upgrading isn't as beneficial as it was in the past, which could elongate the refresh cycle."", 'Still, with all of the innovation being driven by AI demand, this refresh cycle may be shortened due to the immense development of GPUs dedicated to AI models.', ""But does all of this create an investible stock? It's no secret that Nvidia's stock has gotten expensive, and I'm not talking about a dollar figure (although it's nearing the $1,000 mark, which could indicate a stock split is coming). Instead, I'll use an earnings metric to value the company to know how expensive the stock is."", ""Because Nvidia is a rapidly changing business, using trailing earnings in the more traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't useful. Instead, I'll use forward earnings projections (which utilize analyst projections over the next 12 months) to value the company. While this method has its pitfalls, it is the best method investors have for analyzing Nvidia's stock."", 'At 35 times forward earnings, Nvidia is not cheap. Compared to the S&P 500 index -- which trades at 21 times forward earnings, giving a good average of the entire stock market -- Nvidia has a hefty premium attached to its stock.', 'But very few stocks in the S&P 500 are projected to grow revenue at an 80% pace in their current fiscal year. Beyond that, the GPU market is also slated to grow, with Precedence Research estimating the GPU market could be worth nearly $800 billion by 2032.', ""With Nvidia's stronghold on the market and its $61 billion revenue mark last fiscal year, there's still plenty of room for growth. As a result, I think Nvidia is a stock that can continue moving higher over the next five years. While it's expensive now, investors can still get in on the stock and make money if they anticipate holding on for the next five years, even if Nvidia dips due to a spending drawdown."", 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

This may look odd since Tesla’s Q1 earnings were down -53.4% from the year-earlier level on -8.7% lower revenues, and Apple’s earnings and revenue growth rates were -2.2% and -4.3%, respectively. But it isn’t surprising as both companies’ results proved better than what market participants had feared. We also need to keep in mind the impact of Apple’s blockbuster buyback announcement, the largest ever in history.', 'Using estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its March-quarter results on May 22nd, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +49% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues.', 'Please note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.9% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 21.2% of the index’s total earnings in 2024.

In particular, Luria thinks major Nvidia customers including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft will eventually have all the GPU capacity they need. He told BNN Bloomberg recently that these tech giants won't continue buying chips for generative AI indefinitely at the rate they've been buying."", 'All of these companies have developed their own AI chips. For example, Google announced its new Arm-based Axion chip in April. Meta rolled out the next generation of its custom-made MTIA chip last month as well. Amazon offers cloud customers the option of using its cost-effective Inferentia and Trainium2 chips to run AI apps.

Luria told BNN Bloomberg, ""The higher we go this year, the more we\'re going to fall next year, and that\'s not in the stock."" While he acknowledged that it could take longer than he predicted, Nvidia\'s current momentum won\'t last indefinitely.', ""However, Nvidia has a strong first-mover advantage in the AI chip market.

The recent share price gains has brought the company back closer to its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Walt Disney’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', 'The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 17.36% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Walt Disney today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $96.85, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Walt Disney’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Walt Disney. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? DIS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on DIS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Walt Disney at this point in time. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Walt Disney and we think they deserve your attention."", 'If you are no longer interested in Walt Disney, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Missed EPS By 64% And Analysts Are Revising Their Forecasts,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-miss-dentsply-sirona-inc-134008701.html,1714916408,STORY,['XRAY'],"['Last week, you might have seen that DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (NASDAQ:XRAY) released its quarterly result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 7.5% to US$28.29 in the past week. It looks like a pretty bad result, all things considered. Although revenues of US$953m were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings fell badly short, missing estimates by 64% to hit US$0.09 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.', ' Check out our latest analysis for DENTSPLY SIRONA ', ""Following last week's earnings report, DENTSPLY SIRONA's 15 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$3.94b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Earnings are expected to improve, with DENTSPLY SIRONA forecast to report a statutory profit of US$1.06 per share. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$3.99b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.31 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become more bearish following the latest results. While there were no changes to revenue forecasts, there was a real cut to EPS estimates."", 'The average price target fell 7.0% to US$33.82, with reduced earnings forecasts clearly tied to a lower valuation estimate. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values DENTSPLY SIRONA at US$38.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$27.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.', ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 0.05% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 1.0% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 8.1% per year. It's pretty clear that DENTSPLY SIRONA's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that DENTSPLY SIRONA's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target fell measurably, with the analysts seemingly not reassured by the latest results, leading to a lower estimate of DENTSPLY SIRONA's future valuation."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on DENTSPLY SIRONA. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple DENTSPLY SIRONA analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for DENTSPLY SIRONA that you need to be mindful of."", 'Have feedback on this article?

After all, as costs go up, so do premiums, even if those premiums remain fairly consistent in terms of the percentage of value of the assets being insured.', ""In addition to that natural resilience to inflation, insurance companies have a fairly unique ability to make money by investing other people's money. When you buy insurance, your premium is pooled with the premium of other insured people and is available for the company to pay out on claims.

A strong balance sheet -- like the one that Prudential Financial has -- helps an insurer cover those times when it needs to pay out more claims than it expected. That's the financial rock that goes along with the physical one and gives investors good reason to believe that Prudential Financial has strong staying power."", ""When it comes to building a $1 million nest egg, after all, it helps if the companies you're investing in have staying power.

On top of that, under Buffett's direction, Berkshire Hathaway has amassed a multibillion dollar portfolio of major publicly traded companies."", 'Put it all together, and Berkshire Hathaway investors get the benefits of the insurance business plus its subsidiaries plus its investments in public companies. That combination provides a powerful foundation for investors looking for a potential path to millionaire status.', ""CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) might be best known by its network of pharmacies, but thanks to its purchase of health insurer Aetna, insurance is also a substantial driver of CVS Health's revenues. A recent rough earnings release knocked its shares for a loop, but that decline might actually turn out to be decent news for investors with a longer-term time horizon."", ""Despite its short-term challenges, analysts expect CVS to earn $7.40 per share in 2024 and $8.22 per share in 2025 . Its recent market price of $55.90 means that it's available for around 7.6 times its expected 2024 earnings and around 6.8 times its anticipated 2025 earnings."", ""That's the sort of valuation you would expect from a company in decline, not one expected to have fairly stable operations over time. When you add its nearly 4.8% yield to what looks like a value price, you get a business that looks capable of potentially providing decent returns over time for patient investors."", ""No matter how you invest, the journey to a million dollar portfolio will take time. The sooner you get started, the better your chances are of reaching that goal. So make today the day you decide whether one or more of these insurance companies deserves a spot in your portfolio.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$129 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$108. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Oracle's current trading price of US$116 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Oracle’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' See our latest analysis for Oracle ', 'According to our valuation model, Oracle seems to be fairly priced at around 12% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Oracle today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $131.02, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Oracle’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Oracle's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 44%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ORCL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ORCL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

The data analytics company has some promising growth prospects, particularly when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI). Many investors are hopeful that the company can be the next big name in tech. Today, the business is worth around $50 billion. But with so much potential on the horizon, is it possible that this becomes a $1 trillion stock by the end of the decade?"", ""On April 4, Palantir and database giant Oracle announced that they would be joining forces to provide cloud and AI solutions to both businesses and governments. Palantir is going to use Oracle's cloud infrastructure for its foundry workloads. And its AI platform will also be deployable on Oracle's cloud network."", ""Oracle, which has a market cap of around $320 billion, is a much larger tech company, and it can help Palantir potentially reach more customers by working together. By combining Palantir's advanced analytics solutions with Oracle's strong and reliable infrastructure, together the companies can provide businesses and government organizations with robust solutions."", ""Growth is important, but so, too, is profitability. A big reason Palantir's valuation isn't higher these days is because the company has only recently become profitable on a consistent basis. But Palantir has been moving in the right direction as margins are improving, and when combined with more revenue growth, the business' bottom line could look a whole lot stronger in the future."", ""In the company's most recent quarter, for the last three months of 2023, revenue totaling $608.4 million rose at a rate of 20% year over year. And Palantir projects that for the first quarter of 2024 (its earnings come out next week), the top line will come in between $612 million and $616 million as it continues to grow its business."", ""Today, Palantir's stock still looks expensive, trading at a whopping 250 times its trailing earnings. But if the company can continue growing its top line while maintaining a strong profit margin, that multiple will come down, making the stock a more tenable investment."", ""To see where Palantir's valuation may be by 2030, it's important to understand what its bottom line may look like at that point. Let's suppose that its margins continue to improve and that by 2030, Palantir's profit margin is at around 20%. And let's be a bit bullish and assume that its AI platform will draw in a lot of customers and that the company's top line will grow at an annual growth rate of 25% until then. Right now, Palantir is only expecting its revenue to rise by around 20% for the current year."", ""Based on those assumptions, by the end of 2030, Palantir's revenue could come in at around $10.6 billion per year. Assuming a 20% profit margin would mean that its per-year earnings would be around $2.1 billion by then. And assuming the company has roughly 2 billion shares outstanding at the time, its earnings per share would be approximately $1.05."", ""If investors are willing to pay a multiple of 50 times earnings, having a bullish outlook on Palantir's future, the tech stock could command a price of around $53. That would imply a 130% increase in its current price, which would put its valuation at around $107 billion."", ""While that that would be a great return for investors, it would be far shy of $1 trillion. Unless the company's growth rate drastically takes off between now and then or investors are paying an extremely high multiple for the business, it's unlikely that Palantir's stock will hit $1 trillion by the end of the decade."", ""Even if Palantir doesn't hit the $1 trillion mark anytime soon, it can still be a good investment to buy and hold. The company is still growing its business at a high rate, its margins are improving, and its overall trajectory looks promising with AI becoming more of a focus for companies."", ""Investors, however, should be prepared to hang on for the long term because Palantir's near-term gains could be limited given its already high valuation."", 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

While the stock ultimately finished nearly unchanged the day of its report, down -0.2%, there was nonetheless a lot to unpack from the company's earnings report and conference call that could shape where the stock heads over the next few years."", ""Let's look at some of the positive and negatives from its report and whether investors should look to buy or sell the stock."", ""McDonald's was facing some very difficult year-over-year comparisons with its Q1 report, and in that light, it reported a very solid quarter. The fast-food giant grew its global comparable sales by 1.9%. While that is not a huge jump, it marked the company's 13th straight quarter of global same-store growth and came against a 12.6% increase a year ago."", 'Its U.S. markets grew their comparable sales by a solid 2.5% on top of 12.6% growth last year. Meanwhile, comparable-store sales of its international company-operated stores rose 2.7% on top of 12.6% growth a year ago.', 'Overall, revenue rose a solid 5%, or 4% excluding currency impacts, to $6.2 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 2% to $2.70.', ""McDonald's talked about the success of its better burger, which it began to roll out at the start of the year. These burgers include small tweaks, such as how they are assembled and cooked, to improve their quality and taste. The company said the new method helped lift burger sales and get better customer-satisfaction scores."", ""McDonald's said it will test a larger burger in a few markets later this year. If the tests are successful, it will roll the new bigger burger out globally."", ""Despite the solid quarterly results, there were a number of warning signs that the current environment will become more difficult for McDonald's moving forward."", ""One of the biggest warning signs in the quarter for McDonald's was a decline in traffic to its restaurants. On its conference call, management said the company saw flat or declining traffic in the U.S. as well as in other major markets, including the U.K., Australia, Canada, Germany, and Japan. It added that across almost all its major markets traffic is slowing, and it expects quick service restaurant industry traffic in the U.S. to be negative for the full year."", 'Coming out of COVID-19, McDonald\'s and the quick service restaurant industry as a whole greatly benefited from inflation and being able to take a lot of price hikes on menu items. However, the company has previously warned that consumers have begun to push back, and on its Q1 conference call, it called consumers ""price-weary."" McDonald\'s has a larger percentage of lower-income customers, so pricing power moving forward could become an issue. The company said it would be prudent and thoughtful about any other price increases it will take this year and spent much of the call talking about value.', ""McDonald's also talked a lot about the macro headwinds it has been seeing. It noted that it continued to see these pressures at the start of Q2."", ""Now McDonald's isn't the only quick service restaurant chain to see headwinds, as Yum Brands, the owner of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC, saw its Q1 restaurant sales decline -3%, while coffee chain Starbucks saw its global same-store sales drop -4%. However, Chipotle reported very strong results with same-store sales up 7%, as did Wingstop, which saw its domestic comparable-store sales soar 21.6% and company-owned locations rise 6.2%. So this slowdown isn't impacting the entire space equally, but consumers are certainly being more selective."", ""After riding prior price hikes, McDonald's is getting to where it has started to out-price its core-customer base. This led to traffic declines in Q1, but it could lead to negative same-restaurant growth in the future. If this happens, it would likely pressure the stock moving forward."", 'MCD PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.', ""McDonald's trades at about 22 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), which is similar to Yum and Starbucks. That's a pretty typical historical valuation for the company. Given the likely headwinds the company is facing from its customer base being pushed to the limit on pricing and the impact of pricing on traffic, I'd prefer to buy the stock when it goes into the bargain bin. It's not there currently."", ""Over the long haul, McDonald's should be a solid choice but right now, it's facing too many headwinds, and there likely will be better buying opportunities down the road. As such, it could be a good idea to lighten up on positions in the restaurant stock."", ""Before you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:"", ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and McDonald's wasn’t one of them.

And while some consumers might be more hesitant to upgrade their phones right now because the economy isn't ideal, that doesn't mean sales will lag forever. Consumers could simply postpone upgrading their phones to help conserve cash."", 'They could also be waiting for a phone that includes the latest and greatest artificial intelligence (AI) features; generative AI capabilities are rumored to be coming to the iPhone 16 later this year.', ""It would be premature to worry about Apple's business.

Its net income declined by 15% to $772.4 million.

However, despite this, both economic growth and the labor market have displayed resilience. Recent economic indicators have prompted Morgan Stanley Research to revise its forecast for U.S. economic growth, now projecting 2.3% for 2024 and 2.1% for 2025, up from previous estimates of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Consequently, the Fed is expected to initiate the first rate cut of this cycle in July, instead of the previously anticipated June, followed by two more 25 basis point cuts by year-end. Looking ahead to 2025, Morgan Stanley anticipates a continued downward trend in rates, with the Fed making cuts at each meeting through June, aiming to reach a rate of 3.625%.', 'The first quarter of 2024 marked Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick\'s inaugural term, with his background in investment banking and trading standing in contrast to his predecessor James Gorman\'s focus on wealth management. Pick\'s tenure began on a challenging note, with the bank facing headwinds from high-interest rates prompting wealth management clients to shift funds into higher-yielding securities. By April 16, the bank\'s shares had declined by nearly 7% for the year. However, similar to its competitors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley benefitted from robust trading and investment banking performance in Q1. Pick, emphasizing the vital role of dealmaking as an ""existential reality"" for companies, signaled a potential catalyst for Wall Street\'s awaited recovery in investment banking. While Morgan Stanley\'s resurgence in investment banking trailed some of its competitors—Goldman Sachs saw a 32% increase in fees—Pick remained optimistic.', '""I’m feeling good about this being early-to-mid cycle for the classic investment banking, capital markets business around the world,"" said Pick, who succeeded long-serving chief James Gorman in January.', 'See also: Goldman Sachs’ Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024.', ""The results underscored the prowess of Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm, which has been pivotal in driving the bank's growth in recent years, particularly evident in its ability to attract significant new client assets.

Wealth management revenue rose by 4.9% to $6.88 billion, surpassing estimates by $230 million, driven by market gains boosting fee revenue despite a decrease in interest income. At the same time, fixed-income trading revenue dipped by 3.5% to $2.49 billion but still beat expectations by $120 million. Investment banking revenue surged by 16% to $1.45 billion, slightly surpassing the $1.40 billion estimate, driven by higher debt and equity issuance, offsetting lower acquisition fees."", ""Speaking more on its outlook for the future, this is what the bank's management had to say during the first quarter 2024 earnings call:"", 'Looking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII.

This takes the dividend yield to 3.0%, which shareholders will be pleased with."", ' See our latest analysis for Robert Half ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Robert Half's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 47.5% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 44% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.64, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.12. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Unfortunately, Robert Half's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year."", ""In summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

(NYSE:UPS) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase United Parcel Service's shares on or after the 10th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 30th of May."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.63 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$6.48 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that United Parcel Service has a trailing yield of 4.4% on the current share price of US$146.43. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. United Parcel Service paid out 94% of its earnings, which is more than we're comfortable with, unless there are mitigating circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 96% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here."", ""As United Parcel Service's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at United Parcel Service, with earnings per share up 4.7% on average over the last five years. Minimal earnings growth, combined with concerningly high payout ratios suggests that United Parcel Service is unlikely to grow the dividend much in future, and indeed the payment could be vulnerable to a cut."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, United Parcel Service has lifted its dividend by approximately 10% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", ""Should investors buy United Parcel Service for the upcoming dividend? United Parcel Service is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of both earnings and cash flow as dividends, although at least earnings per share are growing somewhat. It's not that we think United Parcel Service is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance."", ""Although, if you're still interested in United Parcel Service and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs for United Parcel Service (1 is a bit concerning!) that you ought to be aware of before buying the shares."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

There are also numerous great companies with decades of dividend increases and mediocre yields. Finding a company with a high yield and a track record of increasing its payout -- now that's an opportunity worth exploring."", ""When a reliable dividend stock also has a high yield, it's typically because payouts have grown faster than the stock price. That's exactly what has been happening with United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), which is down over 30% in the last three years compared to a 60% increase in the dividend."", ""UPS has its challenges, but the beaten-down company is too good to pass up. Here's why."", ""UPS sets straightforward expectations for its dividend growth. The pecking order starts with reinvesting in the business, but after that, it's the dividend."", ""The company's targeted payout ratio is 50% of adjusted prior-year earnings per share. However, due to declining earnings and a higher dividend, it is well beyond that target now. In the following chart, you can see the massive 49% dividend raise UPS made in early 2022 and how it impacted the payout ratio."", 'The good news is that UPS has no intention of cutting the dividend, choosing instead to improve the business to decrease the payout ratio. UPS CEO, Carol Tome, said the following on the Q1 2024 earnings call:', ""It's our intent to earn back into a 50% payout ratio over time. We have no intent to cut the dividend to make that math work. We're going to earn back into it and the dividend is an important part of the value proposition. So we just raised the dividend and we look to, of course, subject to board approval, we look to raise the dividend every year."", ""UPS has paid and raised its dividend for 15 consecutive years. The last dividend raise was a minimum one-cent per-share per-quarter increase. Judging by management's commentary on the earnings call, I would expect minimum raises to continue until the payout ratio comes down."", ""Normally, minimum raises would be cause for concern. But given UPS' downturn and the stock's already hefty yield of 4.4%, it looks like the right move. The question now is determining if UPS has a clear roadmap for growing earnings and turning the business around to return to growth."", 'UPS wants to be the top complex healthcare-logistics provider in the world. Healthcare revenue reached $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024,\xa0but the company expects healthcare revenue to be $20 billion by 2026 -- roughly double what it is today.', 'To get there, UPS is expanding its coverage, boosting key shipping routes, and building facilities for lab customers. The healthcare segment has a higher margin because it focuses on time and temperature-sensitive shipments like lab samples. Healthcare, in general, is a more complex shipping frontier even for less time-sensitive products like medical devices and home-healthcare products.', 'Healthcare embodies UPS\' strategic initiative around its ""better, not bigger"" framework, which focuses on margin growth rather than just sales growth.', 'UPS forecasts moderate delivery-volume increases, just a 5.5% compound annual growth rate in U.S. small packages between 2024 and 2026. UPS believes that the growth, paired with efficiency improvements and healthcare expansion, will allow the company to reach $108 billion to $114 billion in 2026 revenue and an adjusted-operating margin of at least 13%.', ""At the midpoint of that guidance, UPS would earn operating income of $14.4 billion,\xa0which is more than 50% higher than its trailing-12-month (TTM) operating income of $9.1 billion. That kind of operating income makes the dividend expense look much more affordable and sets the stage for future raises. The numbers can get a little complicated since we are discussing operating income, and the payout ratio is based on net income. But we do know that UPS' TTM dividend expense was $5.4 billion, and its net income was $6.7 billion. In other words, UPS could have a payout ratio below 50% based on its 2026 goals."", ""UPS' plan sounds great on paper, but it still has to execute to get there. Its 2024 guidance calls for $92 billion to $94.5 billion in revenue and an adjusted-operating margin between 10% and 10.6%, which would be $9.6 billion in operating income at the midpoint of both those ranges. It's not a big improvement, but it's still a step in the right direction."", ""The company's investor and analyst conference from late March detailed why the ramp-up in margins should start to take shape in 2025 and 2026, so UPS has already given itself a cushion in 2024."", ""The best way to approach an investment in UPS is to think at least three to five years out by focusing on the company's progress toward those 2026 goals rather than getting too caught up in the quarterly results. UPS was way too optimistic about post-pandemic package-delivery volume growth and has been hit especially hard by the industrywide downturn. However, it is making the right strategic moves to position the company for high-margin growth."", 'In the meantime, the 4.4% dividend yield is a compelling incentive to hold the stock and give the story time to play out.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So while NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NetApp:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.22 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$9.4b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).', ""Thus, NetApp has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.6% earned by companies in a similar industry."", ' See our latest analysis for NetApp ', ""In the above chart we have measured NetApp's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for NetApp ."", ""There hasn't been much to report for NetApp's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So it may not be a multi-bagger in the making, but given the decent 22% return on capital, it'd be difficult to find fault with the business's current operations. This probably explains why NetApp is paying out 31% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders."", ""On a side note, NetApp's current liabilities are still rather high at 40% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks."", ""While NetApp has impressive profitability from its capital, it isn't increasing that amount of capital. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 84% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high."", 'NetApp could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation for NTAP  on our platform quite valuable.', ""If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here."", 'Have feedback on this article?

A cochin rooster had accidentally changed a password on a cash register, and someone needed to come and unlock it.', '“We had to explain the situation—a chicken changed the password, and we don’t know what it is and he’s not giving it up,” said Sue Cristante, the fluffy bird’s owner. She had brought her pet chickens into work and dressed them up as bumblebees to help advertise that shoppers at the Ontario, Canada, hardware outlet Peavey Mart could now purchase beehives. “It took them a while to respond.”', 'At the store, Cristante, 56, lends her expertise to customers who are building their own flocks. Pre-pandemic, the company probably sold one chicken coop per year. “Now we can’t keep them in stock,” she said. “Chickens have really caught on.”', 'In the U.S., the $30 billion retailer Tractor Supply is hoping to capitalize on how much people have grown to treasure their chickens. While they often come to chicken-keeping as a way to live a more sustainable lifestyle and get a guaranteed source of fresh eggs for breakfast, people have fallen in love with them.', '“Chickens are really the new third pet out there,” Tractor Supply CEO Hal Lawton told CNBC on April 25. “The vast majority of our customer base partake in the category and they think of them as pets—they name them, take care of them that way, and it’s been a great new source of growth for us over the last five years or so.""', 'Among the company’s 34 million customers who are involved in its loyalty program, one in five owns chickens, he added.', 'Chicks themselves cost $3 or $4 apiece—but once a customer starts to build a flock, they need chicken coops, heaters, feeders, and waterers. The average flock size for customers is 14 birds, though nearly 30% of the company’s customers who raise chickens have 20 birds or more.', '“In America, the new companion animal is the chicken,” CFO Kurt Barton said in a statement to Fortune.', 'Last year, the company sold 11 million chicks, which was more than double the number sold 10 years ago. In 2022, the company launched a brand, Impeckables, to cater to poultry hobbyists. Branded items include chicken toys like a xylophone, tambourine, and fruity treats mixed with mealworms—and they’ve been “all the rage this year,” said Nicole Logan, senior vice president of general merchandising at Tractor Supply.', 'The company has also expanded its “chick days” events. What used to be\xa0 a six-week project with live birds in the store for families to take in on a Saturday outing is now an eight-month event with clusters of fluffy baby chicks on display in stores under heat lamps with feed and water. The company is aiming to be a one-stop shop for anyone who wants to bring chickens home and set up a backyard flock.', 'A 2024 study of attitudes toward chickens found that 13% of U.S. households now own a collective 85 million backyard chickens, with an average of five per owner. A survey of 2,000 chicken carers as part of the study found that nearly 90% were women. Among the 20% who reported that they cared for chickens with health or other issues, such as special needs or disabilities, flock owners said they had used chicken wheelchairs, walking frames, or a hammock to support birds with broken backs. Some 82% of owners said they arrange for a chicken-sitter when they go away for a weekend, and 12% said they let their chickens come in the house whenever they want to.', 'That, however, introduces one of the only drawbacks of chickens—their bathroom habits. “If you’re sitting on the couch watching TV with your chickens, you’re definitely going to get pooped on,” said Cristante. She runs an Etsy shop, Chickenwear by Sue, where she sells colorful hand-sewn chicken diapers and takes custom orders. She’s shipped fashionable chicken apparel to clients in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and nearly every state in the U.S., she said. For one customer in England who included a pet chicken in her wedding party, Cristante made a dress with a white satin harness, small veil, and tiny pearls, with a burgundy bow on the back to match the groomsmen. “It was a very interesting project,” she said. In New York City, a client asked for a Halloween costume, and Cristante sent vampire outfits with detachable capes and bat wings.', '“Chickens—if you’ve never been around them and don’t know—have their own personalities, and some of them are quite affectionate and smart,” said Cristante. She described one popular breed of fluffy chickens known as silkies “like huge cotton balls. They’re very docile and easy to take care of and, honestly, they make very good house pets.""', 'Trish Sie, 53, a film director in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, started with half a dozen chicks and a coop from Williams-Sonoma. The flock grew after the chickens “exceeded all expectations for how fun they are to keep as pets,” she said. “They all have different temperaments and personalities. They learn their names and they’ll name you.” Sie, who directed films such as Pitch Perfect 3 and Players, also makes video content with her chickens, including dances and music videos.', '“I’m so bonded to our dogs, and they really are like man’s best friend for a reason because they love people,” said Sie. “But with chickens, you have to earn their trust because you’re a big thing that can eat them.” Currently, her family has 11 chickens plus a rooster named Brian.', 'Sie first thought she was imagining things when she realized that the chickens all made the same sound when they saw her. But after looking into it, she learned that chickens have names for a number of things in their lives. After being gone for three months on a film set, she came home late at night after the chickens had already put themselves to bed. Just before midnight, she crept over to the coop to see them in the roost and whispered, “Hi chickens."" Three woke up and sleepily clucked the sound that is their “chicken name” for Sie.', 'Sie’s favorite, Ruby, sadly passed away last summer. The bird had a long life with Sie. Once, after suffering a prolapsed cloaca, a common issue for female birds, Ruby let Sie hold her for several hours while her husband gently “reset” the organ with his hands. Ruby lived another three years after that. “That’s the stuff they’ll let you do when they just trust you,” she said. A jeweler friend is recreating Ruby’s foot in sterling silver inlaid with onyx stones; Sie plans to wear the piece around her neck to honor Ruby.', ""According to Tractor Supply's Lawton, part of what’s undergirding the chicken boom is the overall lack of affordability for Millennials and Gen Zers in urban areas. One of the only areas those demographic cohorts can afford to buy homes is in exurban, suburban and rural parts of the country. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s economic research service found that migration to rural areas kicked up by a factor of 45 between 2020 and 2022, compared to pre-pandemic."", '“It is our view that the sense of community found in our markets, perhaps more importantly, the ability to secure a piece of property at a reasonable price, has ensured that rural migration trend is one that is here to stay for the time being,” said Lawton during the company’s earnings call last week.', 'Once there, the Millennial and Gen Z generations seek to live a cleaner life, gardening fruits and vegetables and keeping chickens, said Logan. The poultry category is a gateway to a more sustainable living lifestyle, she said. Plus, that demographic is willing to spend more for organic ingredients. A decade ago, organic chicken feed made up 1% of the company’s sales in the poultry feed space; now it’s over 10%, she added.', '“I wake up every day thinking, ‘How do I get more people interested in this?’” said Logan.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The deal could fetch over $1 billion for the oil company. It's part of the company's plans to maintain a strong financial position following its pending acquisition of CrownRock. "", 'The proposed sale would enable Occidental Petroleum to jump-start its asset sale program. It plans to sell up to $6 billion of assets to help pay off some of the debt it will take on to acquire CrownRock. Starting early could help the company avoid repeating the situation it found itself in after acquiring Anadarko Petroleum. It nearly drowned in the debt it incurred to buy Anadarko because oil prices crashed right after it closed that massive deal. ', 'Reuters recently reported that Occidental Petroleum is working with a financial advisor to seek buyers for its assets in the Barilla Draw region of Texas. The position is part of the prolific Permian Basin. The assets cover 27,500 net acres and produce 24,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). ', 'Occidental is hoping to tap into strong buyer interest for assets in the region. A sale could fetch more than $1 billion. ', 'This potential sale would probably be the first of many for the oil company. It announced last year that it intends to sell $4.5 billion-$6 billion in assets to help repay debt following its acquisition of CrownRock. It aims to reduce its debt principle by at least $4.5 billion within 12 months of closing that deal through asset sales and free cash flow to maintain its investment-grade credit rating. ', ""In addition to its assets in Barilla Draw, Occidental Petroleum could sell down its stake in master limited partnership Western Midstream Partners (NYSE: WES). The company owns nearly half of the midstream company's outstanding units, putting their value at over $6 billion. It initially acquired that stake when it bought Anadarko. That MLP has caught the attention of billionaire Bill Gross, who thinks it's an attractive investment opportunity. "", ""Occidental Petroleum had $18.5 billion of debt on its balance sheet at the end of last year, along with $1.4 billion in cash. The company's debt balance will balloon once it closes its $12 billion deal for CrownRock. It plans to issue $9.1 billion of new debt and assume CrownRock's $1.2 billion of existing debt. That would push the oil company's debt to nearly $29 billion. That's almost double its long-term target of less than $15 billion. "", ""The company's decision to use debt to fund this deal is eerily similar to the financing plan for its 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum. It paid $57 billion for its rival, including $38 billion of equity. In addition to assuming Anadarko's debt, Occidental paid $59 per share in cash (more than 75% of the $76 per share deal value). The company tapped Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway for a $10 billion preferred stock investment to help fund some of the deal's cash component. It also planned to sell $10 billion-$15 billion in assets within two years of closing the deal, $8.8 billion of which it had secured through an agreement with TotalEnergies for Anadarko's assets in Africa. "", ""Unfortunately, that strategy didn't work as well as planned. Occidental wasn't able to close all its planned asset sales with TotalEnergies because of regulatory issues. Meanwhile, oil prices collapsed in early 2020, affecting its ability to sell other assets. These issues nearly pushed Occidental to the brink of bankruptcy. "", ""Given its past missteps, it's good to see the company getting an early start on its asset sale plan. Ideally, it will capitalize on the currently strong market environment to sell assets so that it doesn't run the risk of being a forced seller if there's another unexpected downturn. "", ""Occidental Petroleum appears to be close to selling some of its non-core assets in the Permian Basin for over $1 billion. That would enable the oil company to get a head start on its plan to sell assets to quickly pay down the debt it will take on to acquire CrownRock. Given the company's history, investors should keep a close eye on its progress in selling assets. If deals start falling through, its stock might take a big hit.

Buffett and Berkshire are betting on this company in a far greater way than most investors realize.', ""According to the most recent filings, Berkshire's publicly traded portfolio is worth around $350 billion. It's important to note that this is just a piece of Berkshire's total asset base. It has, for example, complete ownership over dozens of additional businesses whose value is not included in this figure. Still, this $350 billion portfolio is a great way to see what Buffett and his investment team are backing."", 'Occidental Petroleum is currently the sixth largest position in this portfolio, just behind Chevron, another oil and gas producer. Berkshire owns around 250 million shares of Occidental Petroleum worth around $14 billion in total. Note that Occidental Petroleum has a market cap of around $60 billion, meaning Berkshire owns roughly one-quarter of the entire company.', 'Berkshire first bought shares in the first quarter of 2022.

Since taking control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he's grown the value of the business, including its investments, by a compound annual growth rate of 19.8%. That compares with the 10.2% compound total return of the S&P 500 index during that time. Anyone who invested in Berkshire instead of an average S&P 500 fund would have 140 times the amount of wealth today."", ""In recent years, Buffett has been hard-pressed to find a great company to buy. As Berkshire Hathaway grows larger, its operations spin off more cash, and Buffett has seen the company's cash pile grow faster than he can find good investments. His largest investment last year totaled $9.2 billion, while the company ended the year with $167.6 billion."", ""It's a good bet Buffett will continue to snatch up shares of the company this year, as he sees it as undervalued in today's market."", ""As mentioned, Buffett hasn't seen a whole lot to like in the stock market over the past year, so his new investments have been few and far between."", ""One stock that he consistently added to in 2023 and continues to buy in 2024, though, is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). The company holds a strong position in the Permian Basin, giving it access to some of the lowest-cost oil supply in the country. Berkshire Hathaway first invested in Occidental with the purchase of $10 billion in preferred shares in 2019 to support the oil company's purchase of Anadarko. Buffett has since taken a massive 28% stake in the company through its common stock, more than offsetting Occidental's retirement of his preferred shares over the past year. Still, Buffett's Occidental purchases in 2023 only added up to about $3 billion."", ""There's another company Buffett bought a significant stake in last year as well. However, we still don't know exactly what it is. While Berkshire Hathaway is typically required to disclose every position in its portfolio at the end of each quarter, it received a special exemption from the SEC for the last two quarters of 2023. As a result, we don't know exactly what Buffett's been purchasing."", 'But we do have some clues. First of all, the company appears to be a financial stock, based on Berkshire Hathaway\'s reported cost basis of ""banks, insurance, and finance"" equities. Second, Berkshire\'s financial disclosures indicate it invested over $5 billion in the stock in 2023. That means the company must be very large, considering Berkshire is required to disclose the company after amassing a 5% stake in the business. My colleague Sean Williams narrowed the field to just seven potential candidates, his best guess being Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. Since Berkshire asked for the position to remain confidential, investors can bet he\'s planning to buy more in 2024.', ""Still, both those investments pale in comparison to the amount Buffett spent on his largest purchase in 2023. Buffett spent $9.2 billion buying shares in one of his favorite stocks. His first purchase of the company's stock dates to 1962. Yes, Buffett's biggest stock purchase for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year was Berkshire Hathaway stock itself!"", ""Berkshire Hathaway's board of directors previously restricted Buffett's ability to buy back shares based on the stock's price-to-book-value ratio. If the ratio exceeded 1.2, Buffett couldn't buy back any shares of Berkshire Hathaway no matter how much he felt the market was undervaluing the stock."", 'In mid-2018, the board agreed to allow Buffett to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway as long as both he and late Vice Chairman Charlie Munger agreed the stock was priced below its intrinsic value based on a conservative estimate.', 'Since Munger\'s passing, Buffett has become the sole determinant of the stock\'s intrinsic value. But investors shouldn\'t worry that he wields too much power. Buffett is adamant that management should never overpay to buy back its stock. He laid it out plainly in his most recent letter to shareholders: ""All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business value becomes stupid if done at a premium.""', ""What's more, Buffett holds about 99% of his wealth in Berkshire Hathaway stock, and he has many family members with significant amounts of their wealth in Berkshire stock. He only ever disposes of shares when he donates them to charity. His interests couldn't be more aligned with the rest of Berkshire's shareholders."", 'Nonetheless, Buffett has bought back shares of Berkshire Hathaway every quarter since the board authorized the change. That includes $9.2 billion worth last year.', ""Considering Berkshire Hathaway has been producing strong operating results from its wholly owned businesses, generating billions in free cash flow every quarter, it's very likely Buffett will continue to buy shares in 2024. Berkshire Hathaway stock currently trades for just 17.5 times forward earnings estimates. That's well below the S&P 500's forward P/E of 20.8. And when you consider the amount of cash on its balance sheet, that ratio looks even more appealing."", ""So Buffett would be more than justified in his continued repurchase of Berkshire Hathaway stock. We'll find out on Saturday, when Berkshire Hathaway releases its quarterly report, if Buffett bought more shares during the first three months of the year. And if you'd like a growing share of a company Buffett thinks is undervalued, you might consider adding some of the stock to your own portfolio."", 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

Buying stocks can still be a smart move, especially if you\'re a long-term investor.', ""Three Motley Fool contributors have identified stocks they think are no-brainers to buy in May. Here's why they picked Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX)."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): What makes a stock a no-brainer? Excellent financial results, a competitive advantage, or a long runway for growth? The answer is all of those things and more. And Eli Lilly, one of the world's largest healthcare companies, is outstanding in all three categories. In the first quarter, the company's revenue grew by 26% year over year to $8.8 billion, a fantastic performance for a pharmaceutical giant."", ""On the bottom line, the drugmaker's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) landed at $2.58, 59% higher than the year-ago period. Analysts expect Eli Lilly's EPS to grow by an average 50% annually over the next five years. What about the company's competitive advantage? Eli Lilly is one of the leading experts in developing diabetes and obesity medicines. It has a long track record of success in this area. Its most important product, tirzepatide, first earned approval in 2022."", ""It will benefit from patent protection well into the 2030s and significantly contribute to Eli Lilly's top-line growth. That also highlights the growth opportunities available to Eli Lilly. Tirzepatide is indicated to treat diabetes and obesity, with the latter market expected to skyrocket. Eli Lilly's lineup extends far beyond this one product. The company's pipeline is equally exciting. That's why it continues to crush the market but is far from having hit a ceiling. There is plenty of upside left for Eli Lilly, which makes it a great stock to buy in May."", ""David Jagielski (Pfizer): The one healthcare stock that I wouldn't hesitate to buy this month is Pfizer. The stock is incredibly cheap, it pays a dividend, and it's still one of the safest healthcare investments you can own. Whether investors are overly bearish because of the lack of growth it's expecting this year or just being overly punitive on the stock because of waning vaccine demand is irrelevant; investors can get some excellent value by buying the stock right now."", ""There are multiple metrics that help to highlight what kind of a deal Pfizer's stock is. It's trading at 12 times its estimated future profit and 1.7 times its book value, and its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is well below 1. Although investors are right to discount the stock given future uncertainty and the patent cliffs some of its top drugs are facing in the years ahead, the selloff has become extreme; Pfizer's stock is trading at levels it hasn't been at in more than a decade."", 'This truly could be a once-in-a-decade buying opportunity for investors. Pfizer is expecting minimal revenue growth this year but through acquisitions, including its purchase of Seagen last year and developing its pipeline, it expects to add $25 billion in annual new product sales by the end of the decade.', ""It may not be an easy path forward for the healthcare company, but given the significantly reduced price tag the stock trades at, it's easy to justify loading up on Pfizer's shares today. And as a bonus to the potential upside, the stock also pays a dividend that yields 6.2%."", 'Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Only one company markets drugs that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic disease. That company is Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Vertex should have plenty of growth in the CF indication, especially with the company planning to file for regulatory approvals this summer for what could be its most powerful CF therapy yet.', ""However, as lucrative as Vertex's monopoly in CF is, I'm even more excited about the huge new markets that could potentially be on the way. The big biotech already has an approved product in two of those markets. Gene-editing therapy Casgevy is a one-and-done functional cure for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia."", 'Another massive market could open up to Vertex soon. The company recently submitted the first module of its rolling U.S. regulatory submission of suzetrigine (VX-548) in treating acute pain. It expects to complete this filing by the end of the second quarter of 2024. Acute pain is a multibillion-dollar market with significant unmet need. Suzetrigine should have major commercial potential filling the gap between safe but less effective anti-inflammatory medications and highly addictive opioids.', ""Looking a little farther down the road, Vertex has a huge opportunity with inaxaplin in treating APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). There's currently no approved therapy for treating the underlying cause of AMKD. The disease affects around 100,000 patients worldwide compared to an estimated 92,000 CF patients. Vertex is evaluating inaxaplin in a phase 3 clinical study."", ""Want more? Vertex plans to acquire Alpine Immune Sciences for around $4.9 billion. This deal will bring povetacicept into Vertex's pipeline. Alpine is on track to advance the experimental therapy into a phase 3 study in the second half of this year targeting IgA nephropathy, a kidney disease that affects 130,000 patients in the U.S. Like AMKD, there are no approved therapies treating the underlying cause of IgA nephropathy."", ""Vertex could have five new multibillion-dollar therapies within the next few years -- and we're just talking about its recently approved and late-stage programs.

After sending private communications that have had no discernible impact on Norfolk Southern’s conduct, we’re writing to publicly address the false and misleading claims that a subset of you have been making on behalf of the Company. We ask that the Board ensures no further misrepresentations are disseminated about our appropriate engagement with Teamsters affiliates and other topics that are relevant to the outcome of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.', 'Public Support for Ancora’s Full Slate from Multiple Unions', 'It’s been inaccurate when Norfolk Southern has suggested in recent days that it has the full support of rail unions. The BLET and the BMWED – which collectively represent 41.5% of Norfolk Southern’s unionized workforce – issued public statements of support for Ancora’s nominees and not the Company’s current leadership. It is equally important to note that many, if not most, of the BLET and the BMWED members at Norfolk Southern are both employees and shareholders. These individuals care deeply about improving safety for both railroad workers and the communities Norfolk Southern serves. These employee-shareholders also have a stake in the railroad’s long-term success. The following statements released between April 25th and May 2nd make it quite clear that these important union stakeholders seek a change in leadership and fully back our seven-member slate:', 'BLET:', 'General Chairmen of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, Representing Members at Norfolk Southern, Address CEO Alan Shaw’s ""Unfounded and Desperate"" Attacks on Labor Discussions (May 2, 2024 – Link Here)', 'The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, an Affiliate of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Calls for New Leadership at Norfolk Southern (April 26, 2024 – Link Here)', 'BMWED:', 'The BMWED Teamsters Reiterates Support for Jim Barber at Norfolk Southern (May 2, 2024 – Link Here)', 'The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Determines that a Change in Leadership is Needed At Norfolk Southern (April 25, 2024 – Link Here)', 'Facts Regarding the Ancora Nominees’ Appropriate Engagement with Unions', 'When Norfolk Southern has actually acknowledged management’s loss of labor support, it has made false and unsupported claims about our slate’s interactions with unions. These claims overlook key facts, including the following:', 'The parties are completely confident that they are in compliance with applicable law, including the Railway Labor Act.', 'The parties aligned on memoranda that list concepts and principles for improving the treatment of workers, including as a result of enhanced training, improved safety and better quality of life.', 'The memoranda contemplate points of alignment that would only go into effect if the Company and the unions agreed to implement them after the contest, including following a customary process to negotiate and reach agreement on definitive terms.', 'Norfolk Southern’s own counsel wrote to Ancora and acknowledged that memoranda among the parties were not binding on the Company.', 'Response to Additional False and Unsupported Claims', 'Although election contests are hard fought, it’s disappointing to see some of you resorting to what we believe to be outright lies (as laid out below). Ignoring the truth could have serious ramifications beyond the scope of the situation. It needs to stop.', 'In the media and throughout a recent Council of Institutional Investors webinar led by three of you, Norfolk Southern affirmatively stated that Ancora (i) entered into agreements on behalf of the Company, (ii) violated the Railway Labor Act, (iii) committed a crime and (iv) gave away shareholder value via purported backroom deals.1 These statements are simply unsupported by facts. Many other statements also fall into the category of falsehoods and misrepresentations:', 'East Palestine – You say the ""East Palestine incident was not due to bad management or inattention to safety,""2 while the reality is the National Transportation Safety Board concluded the derailment was ""100% preventable"" and that the Company’s people on the ground ""lacked the scientific background"" to recommend what has been deemed an unnecessary toxic chemical burn.3', 'Management’s Commitments – You say ""[w]e make promises and we’ve continued to keep our promises […].""4 In reality, you have presided over an industry-worst Trip Plan Compliance rate that significantly lags the government’s 82% target, meaning on-time delivery commitments to many customers aren’t met. Additionally, you have overseen six straight quarters of misses on consensus EBIT, meaning the expectations of the financial community aren’t met. You also have union leaders making statements about how your ""failure to adequately address significant safety and operations concerns raised by BMWED and others has seriously undermined the railroad.""5', 'Settlement Discussions – You say when it is convenient that Ancora will only settle for control.6 The reality is we have repeatedly stated a desire to settle for minority change of the Board and an orderly CEO transition, which appears inevitable at this point given fading confidence in Mr. Shaw.7 Mr. Shaw also continues to conflate a CEO transition with majority representation on the Board when talking about settlements. When we made all of our unaffiliated nominees available for interviews prior to proxies being filed, it was the Board that showed no real desire to settle by interviewing each candidate once for between 20 minutes to 30 minutes at a time.', 'Shipper Sentiment – Mr. Shaw says 80% of customers may leave due to our slate’s plan. In reality, you are exploiting an anonymized and opaque survey put together by a friendly firm.8 The survey has been best addressed by a leading independent proxy advisor, who notes ""in the absence of further information and a more comprehensive breakdown of the total number of shippers and the types of shippers who were surveyed, we are hesitant about putting much, if any, stock into the results of that survey.""9 You also fail to acknowledge that Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., perhaps Norfolk Southern’s largest customer on a revenue basis, has publicly supported our slate.', 'Director Claude Mongeau – Your promotion of Mr. Mongeau’s purported expertise in governance, regulatory affairs and risk management lacks foundational support.10 With regard to governance, he is a champion of the costly and poorly-disclosed deal with Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited to acquire new COO John Orr – without a shareholder vote – during an election contest.11 Reports from leading independent proxy advisors detail the governance issues, including insufficient disclosure, associated with the Board’s deal to obtain Mr. Orr, who is Mr. Mongeau’s former underling.12 Although it is curiously omitted from his campaign-related biographies, Mr. Mongeau is also a former long-term director of AtkinsRéalis (f/k/a SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.), the parent of the supposedly independent safety consultant – Atkins Nuclear Secured – retained by the Company following the East Palestine disaster.13 The Company appears to want to obscure this, even though Mr. Mongeau serves on the Board’s Safety Committee, which is involved in the relationship. In multiple forms of engagement with Ancora and our nominees, Mr. Mongeau demonstrated an inability to maintain a collegial and professional demeanor, indicating his continuing presence on the Board may be disruptive to incumbents and new members.With respect to regulatory matters and risk mitigation, it is notable that Mr. Mongeau is Chair of the Human Resources Committee and a member of the Corporate Governance Committee at TD Bank, which is reportedly being probed by the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulators due to the bank’s failure to detect money laundering.14 Since Mr. Mongeau became a director in 2015, TD Bank’s board of directors has encountered a number of high-profile regulatory and legal issues stemming from the bank’s apparent failure to maintain a culture of compliance and mitigate money laundering risks.15A railroad with so many regulatory and legal issues of its own, like Norfolk Southern, can do better when it comes to populating its boardroom.', 'In light of the foregoing points, we hope the several members of the Board who are credible, effectively experienced and open-minded guide the Company to accommodate our multiple requests to cease making false and unsupported claims. Our unaffiliated nominees look forward to moving past this contest and partnering with those of you who continue to serve to do what is best for Norfolk Southern over the near-term and long-term. A lot needs to be fixed in order to drive shareholder-friendly governance and enhanced service, safety and value.', 'Sincerely,', 'Frederick D.

Let's dig in and see how it's likely to play out, and why it's important to investors."", ""Many people think of Coca-Cola as the prime beverage superstar. It's the largest beverage company in the world, with $46 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, and sales have steadily increased since bottoming out early in the pandemic; they're up almost 37% since the worst of that time."", 'But the problem started well before that. Coca-Cola was becoming too big to control, and it was a disorganized and rigid global operation. Current CEO James Quincey took the reins in 2017, when sales fell a full 15% for the year. He set out a strategy to pull the company together, reorganizing the bottling ventures and creating a fast and agile distribution network.', ""The pandemic threw a wrench into Coca-Cola's progress, but it reorganized again, and it's now working better and faster. However, revenue remains below where it was 10 years ago. It's getting very close, though, and it's likely to finally surpass that target in the 2024 second quarter:"", ""There's good reason to believe Coke can continue on its growth trajectory under Quincey's steady guidance. One of the major moves it made early in the pandemic was slashing its brand portfolio by about half, from 400 to 200 brands. That's a bold action that freed up resources to devote to its core assets, and Coca-Cola's eponymous brands continue to be its main attractions. Management said that it owns 26 different brands that each bring in more than $1 billion annually, and these main brands are key to future growth."", ""It's not letting it go at that, though. The brands it got rid of were small, mostly local underperformers responsible for about 2% of volume and 1% of revenue. Coca-Cola is still acquiring new brands, but it's focused on top global brands that have robust opportunities in larger markets. For example, it acquired Bodyarmor in 2021, when the brand was growing sales at a rapid clip. Bodyarmor is now one of the company's $1 billion brands."", 'Acquisitions can be an important growth driver because when Coke adds new drinks to its systems, they can reach new customers with great efficiency. That can lead to a big boost in revenue, at least initially, without adding commensurate expenses.', ""With this twin growth strategy of investing in its core brands and acquiring new ones to boost sales, Coca-Cola is well positioned to use its distribution network effectively and generate higher sales and profits. It's touching the tip of its previous record sales figures, and it should easily go higher."", ""Coca-Cola has been a reliable dividend superstar for decades, but its stock price hasn't been as impressive, trailing the broader market for most of the past 30 years. That doesn't make it a loser; on the contrary, most individual stock portfolios benefit from having some stable high-value and dividend stocks that anchor their holdings."", ""Coca-Cola stock offers stability, value, and reliable passive income. And as it's poised to set a record for annual sales this year, this is a great time to buy the stock."", 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

That doesn't mean that the dividend will always be safe and that payouts will always continue, but it's an important factor that dividend investors often consider when picking income stocks. Three stocks that have been making dividend payments going back to the 1800s are Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD). Here's a look at how far back their streaks go and why these are still terrific dividend stocks to own today."", ""Eli Lilly has been paying investors a dividend since 1885. Over the years, it has evolved, acquired companies, brought new drugs to market, and continued to be a reliable dividend investment. Today, the stock may not look like much of an income investment; it's only yielding 0.7% -- well below the S&P 500 average of 1.4%."", ""But in reality, this has been an exceptional dividend stock. The company has doubled its dividend payments in just the past five years. Although its yield looks low, that's only because of how hot the stock has been of late. In three years, shares of Eli Lilly have soared more than 300%. If not for its rapidly rising share price, Eli Lilly's dividend yield would be much higher than it is today."", ""The company's growth prospects look amazing. Eli Lilly has a couple of promising assets in its portfolio in Zepbound and Mounjaro, with the former being a top weight-loss drug and the latter being approved for diabetes. Together, these drugs could generate more than $50 billion in annual revenue for Eli Lilly. With strong financials and some terrific growth on the horizon, the drugmaker isn't just a good dividend stock but also a phenomenal option for growth investors."", ""Soft drink giant Coca-Cola is a top dividend growth stock. It's part of an exclusive club of Dividend Kings, having increased its payouts for decades. While it has been raising its dividend payments for 62 consecutive years, its streak of issuing dividends goes back all the way to 1893. Today, the stock's dividend yields 3.1%."", ""Despite the continuous rate hikes, Coca-Cola's dividend isn't unsustainable; profits have soared along with the dividend increases. Coca-Cola's payout ratio is around 75%, which is a sustainable rate and offers room for even more aggressive rate hikes than the already generous 5.4% increase the company announced earlier this year."", ""Coca-Cola's business remains solid, with the company projecting around 7% organic revenue growth this year. With a versatile and seemingly unshakable business model, this is one of the best dividend stocks you can buy and hold for the long haul."", ""The longest dividend streak on this list belongs to Toronto-Dominion Bank. Going back to 1857, the Canadian-based bank has one of the best track records for paying dividends that you'll find."", ""It doesn't have a long streak of dividend increases like Coca-Cola does, but it does offer investors a much higher yield at 5.1%. Investors haven't been all that bullish on bank stocks amid rising interest rates, but make no mistake, TD is one of the safer options in the industry you can hold in your portfolio."", ""In the trailing 12 months, the company has reported net income totaling 11.5 billion Canadian dollars on revenue of CA$53.6 billion, for a solid profit margin of 21%. TD is one of Canada's top chartered banks, and it also has a strong presence in the U.S. The company's diversified business makes it a suitable option for long-term investors, and its high-yielding stock makes now an optimal time to consider buying shares of TD."", 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

Don't sweat it. Let a proven stock-picker do the legwork for you. Warren Buffett will do just fine. He's not called the Oracle of Omaha for nothing, after all."", ""Here's a rundown of three of the bigger positions held by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway that would probably be at home in your portfolio as well."", ""Investors might be a bit hesitant to own any bank stocks right now. The industry is on the defensive, dealing with rising loan defaults and delinquencies at the same time it's experiencing tepid demand for other banking services. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is no exception to this trend."", ""However, there's a reason BofA shares are up since the bank released its first-quarter numbers in mid-April, renewing a rally that began in October and carried the stock to a new 52-week high just last week. That reason? Almost all the problems the banking business is facing now are temporary, and perhaps even winding down."", ""Take corporate fundraising and M&A (mergers and acquisitions) as an example. This business hit a wall in 2022 and 2023 after a robust 2021. It's now showing signs of new life. Numbers from Dealogic indicate that total M&A deals were up 30% year over year during the first quarter of 2024, driving 14% growth in total investment banking fees during the same three-month stretch. Bank of America's Q1 investment banking revenue improved to the tune of 27%."", 'This business is expected to continue growing going forward too, following successful IPOs from the likes of Reddit and Astera Labs. As investment management outfit Baird put it, there\'s an ""M&A recovery right around the corner.""', ""It's not just a brewing rebound in mergers and acquisitions or initial public offerings making BofA a compelling prospect, though. It's the economic tailwind behind this rebound -- it's apt to drive fresh demand for all of Bank of America's profit centers. In the meantime, credit-scoring technology company VantageScore says that loan delinquencies fell last month, the first decrease since May 2021. The average credit score improved as well."", ""This implies that people are getting a better handle on their debt. That bodes well for lenders like BofA that suffered a measurable increase in loan charge-offs last quarter. Those write-offs may be as bad as things are going to get for the bank's loan portfolio this cycle."", ""Berkshire owns a little over one million shares of BofA, by the way, making it the fund's second-biggest trade."", ""Warren Buffett isn't just a big fan of the product (he reportedly drinks as many as five cans of the namesake soda every day). He's also a major shareholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO). Berkshire holds nearly $25 billion worth of the soda giant's stock -- a position it's been holding for a long, long time."", ""It's not tough to figure out why. Coca-Cola is just a great company. The organization's brilliantly marketed its products as well as its brand names for decades now, making them a lifestyle choice we often buy without even thinking about other options. It's such a popular name and logo, in fact, that you'll frequently find it on clothing, home décor, toys, and more. Indeed, it's not a stretch to suggest the Coca-Cola name has been sewn into the fabric of our culture."", ""Buffett's interest in the company is much more pragmatic, though. Coca-Cola's branding and marketing firepower is just a means to an end. And that end is cash flow -- an ever-growing amount of it."", ""While there are faster-growing companies out there, there aren't many growing as consistently as Coca-Cola's been able to beef up its bottom line. This earnings growth in turn supports an ever-growing dividend. In this vein, The Coca-Cola Company's recently upped its annualized dividend payout for a 62nd consecutive year.\xa0The current dividend yield stands at 3.1%."", 'Do understand that Coca-Cola is first and foremost an income stock. But what an income stock it is, and will likely remain for years to come!', 'Last but not least, add credit card middleman Visa (NYSE: V) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy hand over fist in May.', ""If you've been following it for a while, then you likely know that Visa shares have been falling since late March. Not even its recent fiscal second-quarter earnings beat was enough to jolt the stock out of its downtrend. Neither was the company's decision to not lower its full-year guidance, as some investors expected it to -- Visa still anticipates sales growth rates in the low double digits for the remainder of the year, in line with its results thus far."", ""The stock's sinking anyway.\xa0Chalk it up to worries over new credit card regulations, which limit the size of late fees that card issuers can charge. Record-breaking credit card balances aren't helping either, as they seemingly leave the company less room for growth. Then there's the impending merger of rivals Discover and Capital One, which will make for a more formidable competitor."", ""These worries are all more bark than bite, however. Visa has pushed through bigger challenges. And it will do so again, this time by capitalizing on its strengths like payment-tech innovation and its sheer reach. Visa handles a market-leading 40% of the planet's card-based transactions. It matters simply because it's much easier to remain in the lead than it is to take the lead."", ""Berkshire owns a little over 8 million shares of Visa that are collectively worth $2.2 billion, by the way. That's not a huge stake compared to the size of its positions in Coca-Cola or Bank of America. But it's still telling that Buffett's been willing to sit on and add to this position for a decade now."", 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For every share that it buys back, Coke lowers its required dividend payout because the dividend is paid on a per share basis. Still, dividend payments will likely be just above $8 billion this year due to the modest financial impact of stock buybacks."", ""Coke's annual payout raise for next year will depend on a few key factors, including sales growth, profitability, and cash flow.

Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.973. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.', 'Weakness', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company.

(NYSE:DVA), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. Revenues were US$3.1b, approximately in line with whatthe analysts expected, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$2.65, an impressive 28% ahead of estimates. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for DaVita ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from DaVita's six analysts is for revenues of US$12.6b in 2024. This would reflect a satisfactory 2.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to dip 4.2% to US$8.91 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$12.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.64 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates."", ""The analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 7.7% to US$141. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on DaVita, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$169 and the most bearish at US$122 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable."", ""Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The analysts are definitely expecting DaVita's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 3.1% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 1.2% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.7% per year. It seems obvious that, while the future growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, DaVita is expected to grow slower than the wider industry."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around DaVita's earnings potential next year. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that DaVita's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple DaVita analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""However, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 2 warning signs for DaVita (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Simply put, the market has little faith in management's guidance, and unfortunately, the latest first-quarter earnings report did little to dispel those fears. That said, there's a margin of safety baked into the valuation. Is it enough to justify buying the stock?"", ""Testing an investment hypothesis with hard evidence of a trend in quarterly results makes sense. In that vein, here's a brief recap of the case for Whirlpool in 2024."", ""Investors understand that this will be a challenging year for Whirlpool. Management forecasts like-for-like sales to be flat at $16.9 billion, and ongoing earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) to also be flat at 6.8%. That's understandable in a year when relatively high interest rates are pressuring the housing market and discretionary spending on household appliances."", ""However, management is aggressively cutting costs ($800 million in 2023, with a further $300 million to $400 million planned for 2024). At the same time, the deal to combine its European major domestic appliance (MDA) business with an Arcelik business (Whirlpool owns a 25% stake in the new company, Beko Europe) will rid the company of a low-margin and cash-guzzling business. Whirlpool's overall margin and cash flow generation should improve as a result of the deal."", 'As a result, management aims to refocus on its core and higher-margin North America MDA business while developing its growth markets in Latin America MDA and Asia MDA and investing in its global small domestic appliance (SDA) business.', 'Ultimately, management expects growth to improve in the second half, and continues to expect the following this year:', 'Ongoing EBIT margin of 6.8%', 'MDA North America EBIT margin of 9%, and exiting 2024 with EBIT margin of 10% to 11%', 'Cost actions of $300 million to $400 million', 'Ongoing EPS of $13 to $15', 'Free cash flow generation of $550 million to $650 million', ""It's a compelling investment proposition. And as noted earlier, if Whirlpool merely hits the figures, there's a good chance the stock will end 2024 significantly higher."", 'The current valuation suggests that the market doesn\'t believe the company will hit these numbers, and an analyst at RBC Capital recently lowered the price target on the stock from $85 to $79 while maintaining an ""underperform"" rating. The recent results didn\'t greatly help the bull\'s case for two reasons.', 'First, MDA North America was actually the company\'s weak point, with an 8% decline in sales EBIT margin to 5.6% from 10.1% in the same quarter of 2023. In addition, CFO Jim Peters noted: ""It is clear the current level of promotional investments is not achieving our value-creation expectations"" during the earnings call. Essentially, its promotional activity failed to stimulate discretionary MDA purchases. In response, Peters announced a ""weighted average 5% promotional program price increase.""', 'Second, management noted that a combination of ""sticky inflation impact on supply chain costs"" meant it was trending toward the low end of the $300 million to $400 million cost reduction aim. It gets worse, as management noted unfavorable raw material cost trends could pressure margins in 2024.', ""Sticky inflation, rising raw material costs, and an unsuccessful promotional program in its core North American market all appear to pressure Whirlpool's outlook. In addition, there's no guarantee that the 5% price increase won't result in some market share loss or volume decline."", 'On a more positive note, the other three ongoing segments performed well, and management believes a ""massive product launch"" of SDAs (including espresso machines and innovative grain and rice cookers) in the second quarter will drive growth in high-profit-margin categories.', 'Whirlpool', 'First Quarter EBIT', 'Growth', 'EBIT Margin', 'MDA North America', '$135 million', '(49)%', '5.6%', 'MDA Latin America', '$65 million', '81%', '7.8%', 'MDA Asia', '$11 million', '38%', '4.6%', 'SDA Global', '$33 million', '74%', '18.1%', 'Data source: Whirlpool presentations.', ""The company has a lot of work to do to meet its guidance, and the first quarter was not the best way to start the year. A lower-interest-rate environment will help Whirlpool, but it can't be counted on. Meanwhile, Whirlpool faces challenges on the revenue and cost side of the profit equation."", 'As such, it remains a deep-value stock option, just less attractive than it looked before these earnings. On balance, the investment case is still intact. Still, the company will have to demonstrate that its 5% price increase is sticking before investors feel fully confident with its full-year guidance.', 'Before you buy stock in Whirlpool, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Whirlpool wasn’t one of them.

And welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Christy McElroy, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.', 'Christy McElroy: Good morning. And welcome to Regency Centers first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Alan Roth, East Region President and Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Wibbenmeyer, West Region President and Chief Investment Officer.

It’s possible that actual results may differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements we may make.', 'Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements may be included in our presentation today and are described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings.

Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information, including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applies to these presentation materials. Lisa?', 'Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We had another really solid quarter in line with our expectations and driven by a continuation of very healthy leasing fundamentals. Robust tenant demand is driving significant leasing activity across all of our shopping centers and this is evident in an even higher percent lease rate and strong rent growth. With this robust demand and activity, we are poised to accelerate growth into 2025. As you will hear more from Alan, we are having great success quickly re-leasing space, and I will note some of which we’ve intentionally recaptured, with upgraded merchandising of leading operators and at higher rents. As a result, our pipeline of executed leases is larger than it’s ever been and we look forward to these tenants coming online, propelling our future growth.', 'I’m also really excited about the progress our team has made executing on our value creation pipeline. Sustained development activity over the long-term, which creates value and enhances growth, is an important part of our business and is a differentiator for Regency in our sector today. The strength of our platform provides us an unequaled strategic advantage. Our talented and experienced national development team, our relationships with top grocers and retailers, and ready access to capital, all are enabling strong execution on an impressive lineup of great in-process projects and continued growth in our pipeline of opportunities. As you’ll hear from Nick, following our impressive execution in 2023, with over $250 million of development and redevelopment starts, we expect to drive a similar level of success this year.', 'The benefits from this ramp-up in activity will continue to grow as NOI comes online in 2025 and beyond. Importantly, the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity position is what provides Regency with the ability to sustain a meaningful value creation pipeline through cycles, to remain opportunistic in our capital allocation strategy and to consistently grow our dividend. And we are really gratified to see this position of strength acknowledged by Moody’s with a credit rating upgrade to A3, which occurred in February. We are currently the only REIT in the open-air shopping center sector with an A rating, and we are already seeing the benefits in our relative bond market pricing, further supporting our cost of capital advantage. This is a big accomplishment and a direct result of our team’s consistent track record of operational excellence and balance sheet strength over the long-term.', 'It’s a reflection of what I speak to often, which is what we believe to be Regency’s unique and unparalleled combination of strategic advantages that differentiates us from our peers and allows us to drive above-average earnings per share, dividend and free cash flow growth. It’s the favorable attributes of our portfolio, including quality tenants and merchandising mix, format and trade area demographics, driving rent growth and durability of occupancy. It’s the expertise of our people and the strength of our operating platform. It’s our ability to create value through development and redevelopment consistently over time. It’s the strength of our balance sheet. And it’s our commitment to corporate responsibility and stakeholder stewardship.', 'High quality suburban shopping centers, especially with the particular strength of our portfolio and the trade areas in which we operate, will continue to benefit from structural tailwinds that support continued excellent performance and long-term growth of our business. Alan?', 'Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We had another great quarter of leasing activity in Q1, as tenant demand for our centers remained very strong. The tremendous appetite for space that we saw in 2023 has continued unabated, enabling our team to achieve both higher rents and push our lease rate to even higher levels. We are executing leases with high-quality tenants, further improving upon the strength of our merchandising and creating value at our centers. Our same property percent lease rate increased by another 20 basis points this quarter to 95.8%. This is especially impressive given the significant anchor move-outs that I discussed on last quarter’s call, which I’ll come back to in a moment, coupled with the seasonality of higher move-outs we historically experienced in the first quarter.', 'Our shop lease rate was up 10 basis points sequentially in the first quarter, reaching yet another new record high for shops of 93.5%. Base rent growth in 2024 is benefiting from shop commencement activity, given our record year of lease-up in 2023. You’ll recall that a quarter ago we discussed an expected decline in our commenced occupancy rate in the first quarter, driven by anchor move-outs. Consistent with our plan, while our lease rate has moved even higher, our same property commence rate ended the first quarter down 70 basis points from year-end. Roughly half of this decline was attributable to the intentional recapture of a Walmart store in Norwalk, Connecticut. Some of you were with us on a recent tour of the property, seeing firsthand this great opportunity to create value from an anchor tenant lease expiration in an exceptional location.', 'We will experience some downtime impact while the space is built out and the center undergoes a transformative redevelopment, but the new lease with Target has already been executed with significant accretion. This is just one example of similar scenarios within the portfolio. On the surface, this disconnect between lease occupancy and rent-paying occupancy would appear counterintuitive, but the strength in the leasing environment, coupled with our deliberate approach to asset management, is enabling us to take advantage of these accretive opportunities quickly, and in many cases, before the tenant vacates. We are re-merchandising with upgraded stores and at higher rents, improving and growing the long-term value of our centers, and we look forward to getting these new anchors open for business in the coming months.', 'As we’ve replenished this vacating space with new leases, our pipeline of executed leases has grown. We stand today with a 370-basis-point delta between our same property leased and commenced occupancy rates, which is an all-time high for us, reflecting an incremental $50 million of annual base rent that will be very rewarding as these leases commence within our operating portfolio. Beyond what’s already baked, we have another 1.4 million square feet of space under letter of intent or in negotiation, with consistent demand across the portfolio from a wide variety of categories, including grocers, restaurants, health and wellness, off-price, and personal services. Cash re-leasing spreads in the first quarter were more than 8% on a blended basis, including the highest spread for renewals that we’ve seen since 2019, an indication of our ability to increase rents further as occupancy rises and available space is limited, a reflection of the strong demand in today’s environment.', 'Both GAAP and net effect of rent spreads were in the mid-teens this quarter, given strength in contractual rent steps in the majority of our leases and our prudent use of leasing capital. Our team across the country is energized by the unwavering strength in leasing activity we are seeing, supported by a limited supply of high quality retail space available and a surplus of great retailers actively looking to expand. We look forward to harvesting the benefits of our record-high SNO pipeline, getting those tenants open and operating, and continuing to move the occupancy needle higher in the months ahead. Nick?', 'Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. Motivated by our tremendous success in 2023, including the start of more than $250 million of new projects, our team remains very active, both executing and growing our development and redevelopment pipelines. Among our first quarter starts was the shop at Stone Bridge in Cheshire, Connecticut. This $67 million ground-up development will be anchored by Whole Foods as well as TJ Maxx, and while we just broke ground last month, we are already seeing significant leasing demand. The project serves as the retail component of a new master plan community, a format with which we’ve had great success over the years. We recognize the mutual benefits and value that these relationships with master plan developers can provide for our shopping centers, as well as the communities they serve.', 'In addition to new starts, we continue to make great progress executing on our in-process pipeline and bringing NOI online. In total, we now have more than a $0.5 billion in process, which is nearly 90% leased with blended returns of 9%, and in 2024, we plan to complete over $200 million of these projects. Some examples of this tremendous progress are several exciting recent anchor openings that are worthy of highlighting. At our Glenwood Green ground-up development in Old Bridge, New Jersey, both Target and ShopRite celebrated successful grand openings last month and the project is now nearly 95% leased. Exciting shop tenants opening soon include Honeygrow, Duck Donuts, and Playa Bowls. At Westbard Square in Bethesda, the new giant grocery store opened in January, and rent will start commencing from the shop space over the coming months, including tenants such as Tate, Stretch Zone, Silver & Sons Barbecue, and Oak Barrel & Dine.', 'Turning to the private transactions market, although data points and deal volumes remain below historical norms, we are seeing increased activity in deeper bidding pools in the marketplace and cap rates remain low. The implications of the recent move in treasuries remains to be seen, but our team is actively underwriting acquisition opportunities that fit within our portfolio quality, growth and earning decrease in requirements. This includes a great asset that we are buying in Westport, CT, immediately adjacent to one of our existing centers, adding to our already strong portfolio in that region. As we look ahead, our team is focused on sourcing accretive investment opportunities across our national platform. We expect to execute on acquisitions opportunistically and we have great visibility on development and redevelopment activity as we continue to grow our pipelines.', 'We are planning for another year of project starts north of $200 million and remain on track to meet our strategic objective of completing more than $1 billion of projects over the next five years. We are partnering with leading grocers looking to grow their footprints in high-quality centers within our attractive trade areas and our recent project successes are also driving additional opportunities to further grow our pipeline. The strong momentum within our program is supported by macro tailwinds within the shopping center business, but more importantly, by Regency’s sourcing and execution capabilities. As you hear me repeatedly say, we have the best development team in the business, which combined with our free cash flow and balance sheet give us an unequaled ability to fund and drive significant value creation within our investments program.', 'Mike?', 'Mike Mas: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I’ll start with some highlights from our first quarter results and then walk through updates to our 2024 guidance and forward expectations before ending with comments on our balance sheet position. We reported NAREIT FFO of $1.08 per share and core operating earnings of $1.04 per share for the first quarter. Same property NOI growth, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections, was 2.1%. It’s worth a reminder that while bad debt this quarter trended closer to our historical averages, we are comping against a year ago bad debt number that was net positive, which we know is unusual. This anomaly impacted our first quarter growth rate by 60 basis points. At 2.7%, base rent was the largest contributor to same property NOI growth and continues to be the best indicator of portfolio performance.', 'This was largely driven by our team driving rent growth through embedded rent steps and re-leasing spreads, as well as executing on our redevelopment pipeline. Our same property leased occupancy rate is 95.8%, up another 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the continued strong leasing environment. First quarter earnings results benefited from a penny of timing-related items outside of the same property pool, as well as a penny of straight-line rent, which you can see in our increased full year non-cash guidance. Additionally, recall that we typically recognize more than half of our annual percentage rents in the first quarter, benefiting Q1 by about $0.3 compared to the implied run rate for the balance of the year. I also would like to point out our new AFFO disclosure on Page 9 of our supplemental, which highlights what, in our view, is one of the most important performance metrics reflecting a REIT’s ability to grow dividends and to invest back into its business in order to grow earnings.', 'This added disclosure also provides transparency around the level of capital used to drive same property NOI growth and allows for greater apples-to-apples comparison across the peer group. Turning to our guidance updates, as always, I’ll refer you to the helpful detail on Slides 5 through 6 in our earnings presentation. We raised our NAREIT FFO outlook by a penny at the midpoint, which corresponds to the increase in our guidance for non-cash items. Our guidance for same property NOI growth remains unchanged at 2% to 2.5%, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections. We also adjusted our full year transactions outlook. As Nick referenced earlier, the asset we are buying in Westport is now included in our acquisition guidance and we modestly increased our dispositions guidance to include the potential sale of a few smaller, non-core, lower growth assets.', 'Notably, our core operating earnings guidance -- earnings per share guidance, excluding COVID period reserve collections, implies growth of more than 3% at the midpoint, despite higher interest rates and the impact of our debt refinancing this year. As we look beyond the calendar year, we wanted to highlight some tailwinds we see impacting our growth, especially as it relates to items where we have greater visibility. We’ve discussed the meaningful growth coming from our pipeline of executed leases, where outsized commencement activity will begin as we approach year-end and move into 2025. As Alan mentioned, our SNO pipeline sits at an historical high of more than $50 million of annual base rent, of which about 65% is scheduled to commence by the end of this year.', 'In fact, we expect our spot commence occupancy rate to end this year roughly 50 basis points higher as compared to year-end 2023. As these lease commencements are weighted to the second half of the year, the NOI and earnings impact will largely occur in 2025. And as Nick discussed, we’ve continued to ramp up our in-process development redevelopment activity and look forward to completing these projects, delivering space and commencing rent. We expect same property NOI to benefit from this redevelopment activity and for growth to accelerate into 2025. The positive contribution to same property NOI is likely to exceed 100 basis points next year, leading to above-trend overall growth. And total NOI growth will also benefit from the continued momentum of our ground-up development program, which will also start to bear more fruit as we head into next year.', 'Finally, turning to our balance sheet, the recent credit rating upgrade from Moody’s to A3 further validates Regency’s balance sheet strategy and liquidity position. We are relatively insulated from the current volatility in the debt capital markets as our balance sheet is in phenomenal shape. The majority of this year’s maturities have been pre-funded following our bond issuance in January, which we are gratified to price at a 10-year treasury yield, meaningfully below where it fits today and our next unsecured bond maturity is not until November 2025. Nearly all of our debt is fixed, our weighted average maturity is close to seven years and we remain near the low end of our targeted leverage range of 5 times to 5.5 times net debt preferred to EBITDA.', 'We have approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity today, including nearly full capacity on our revolver and we remain on track to generate free cash flow of more than $160 million this year. With that, we are happy to take your questions.', 'See also', 'What is an Annuity for Retirement? 15 Dividend Stocks to Buy Instead and', '25 States That Are Struggling the Most with Credit Card Debt.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

(NYSE:EL) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.66 per share on the 17th of June. This means the annual payment will be 2.0% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average.', ' See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', ""While yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Prior to this announcement, the dividend made up 148% of earnings, and the company was generating negative free cash flows. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating free cash flows is a major warning sign for the sustainability of the dividend as these levels are certainly a bit high."", ""Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 45%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated."", ""The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.72 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 14% over that duration. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Over the past five years, it looks as though Estée Lauder Companies' EPS has declined at around 19% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable."", ""Overall, this isn't a great candidate as an income investment, even though the dividend was stable this year. The company isn't making enough to be paying as much as it is, and the other factors don't look particularly promising either. We don't think that this is a great candidate to be an income stock."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Estée Lauder Companies (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.

Both companies have two key traits that dividend investors crave: Predictability and high yields.', 'Coca-Cola and Pepsi are two of the most predictable dividend payers on the market. Both companies have paid and increased their dividends for more than 50 years (61 years and 51 years, respectively), earning them the prestigious title Dividend King.', 'Coca-Cola and Pepsi are also both considered to have high-yield dividends -- a yield is how much investors get back compared to the value of the investment. The yield for Coca-Cola is over 3%, whereas the yield for Pepsi is just below that. But as the chart below shows, the yield for both companies is more than double the average for the S&P 500.', ""However, if there's a knock against Coca-Cola and Pepsi as dividend investments, it's in their ability to grow their dividends."", ""In February, Coca-Cola announced that it was raising its dividend by about 5%. For its part, Pepsi's latest raise (also announced in February) was better at 10%. Therefore, they are growing dividends, but it's fair to wonder if raises in future years will be as big as these."", ""Many investors look at a company's cash flow and compare it to dividend payments to get a sense of how much a dividend can grow over time. In Coca-Cola's case, this year it expects full-year free cash flow of $9.2 billion, down slightly from 2023. But it paid $8 billion in dividends in 2023 and just raised its dividend by 5%. Therefore, future raises could be small because its dividend is eating up a lot of its current cash flow."", ""Pepsi is in a similar situation. It doesn't talk about free cash flow in its earnings reports. But looking at traditional profitability metrics shows a comparable situation. In 2024, the company expects to pay dividends of $5.06 per share. In comparison, it expects $8.15 in earnings per share (EPS) this year. Therefore, it expects to pay out 62% of its earnings as dividends this year, which leaves some room for future raises. But dividend increases likely won't outpace EPS growth."", ""Dividend growth is important for investors with longer time horizons. That's why dividend investors might want to give the third biggest beverage company, Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP), a look today."", 'With its dividend yield of 2.6%, many dividend investors will look past Keurig Dr Pepper stock and buy shares of Coca-Cola or Pepsi instead, given the higher yields. However, Keurig Dr Pepper has increased its dividend at a faster rate over the last five years, and I believe it can do it again.', 'Keurig Dr Pepper just reported financial results, and its profits are finally surging after years of disappointing progress.', ""Over the last five years, Keurig Dr Pepper's gross profit growth has outpaced revenue growth, which is a good thing to see. The company's operating profit growth is outpacing progress with its gross profit, which is even better. While this is a five-year trend, the trend since the beginning of 2023 is more pronounced."", ""Keurig Dr Pepper's management credits its improvements to just good old-fashioned operational discipline. What I like about this kind of improvement is that it's not driven by external factors, which are unpredictable and perhaps not repeatable. The company can sustain its success and even further build on it."", ""As it is, Keurig Dr Pepper has a dividend payout ratio of just 54%, according to YCharts. That's far lower than the payout ratios for Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which are both at 74%. This metric alone suggests that Keurig Dr Pepper has more room to grow its dividend at a faster pace than the other two. And if the company keeps growing its earnings at a faster pace, then it will have even more room."", ""Keurig Dr Pepper won't necessarily be the top-performing stock on the market year in and year out -- it's a mature business and growth is modest. But from a dividend perspective, I believe Keurig Dr Pepper can supply investors with consistency, a generous yield, and above-average dividend growth for the next several years and beyond."", 'Before you buy stock in Keurig Dr Pepper, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Keurig Dr Pepper wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ:PEP) has announced that the dividend on 28th of June will be increased to $1.36, which will be 7.1% higher than last year's payment of $1.26 which covered the same period. This takes the annual payment to 2.9% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry."", ' View our latest analysis for PepsiCo ', ""We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, PepsiCo's dividend was making up a very large proportion of earnings and perhaps more concerning was that it was 96% of cash flows. This is certainly a risk factor, as reduced cash flows could force the company to pay a lower dividend."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 41.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 59% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $2.27 total annually to $5.06. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.3% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns."", ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though PepsiCo's EPS has declined at around 5.6% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend."", ""Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We don't think PepsiCo is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus."", ""Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for PepsiCo that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
