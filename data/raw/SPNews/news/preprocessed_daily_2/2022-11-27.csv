This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Nucor The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.78bUS$1.87bUS$3.19bUS$3.38bUS$3.55bUS$3.69bUS$3.82bUS$3.93bUS$4.03bUS$4.13bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.11%Est @ 4.87%Est @ 4%Est @ 3.4%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67%Est @ 2.47% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$2.6kUS$1.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$71bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$71b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$33bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$55b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$149, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Nucor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.161. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Nucor, we've put together three relevant factors you should consider:Risks: You should be aware of the 2 warning signs for Nucor (1 is significant!) we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for NUE's future outlook?

1,c61f88cf-5701-3573-ba49-6dcb80c54193,QRVO,2022-11-27,"Qorvo, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:QRVO) recent 3.0% pullback adds to one-year year losses, institutional owners may take drastic measures",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qorvo-inc-nasdaq-qrvo-recent-133822289.html,1669469902,STORY,['QRVO'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 3.0% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 35% for shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Qorvo, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Qorvo. View our latest analysis for Qorvo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Qorvo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Qorvo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Qorvo's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 6.7% of Qorvo shares are controlled by hedge funds. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.1% and 6.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of QorvoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Qorvo, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$66m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Qorvo. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Qorvo that you should be aware of before investing here.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

3,fa00762e-bbe0-3534-92f8-eb2b9d0eaf91,WMT,2022-11-27,11 Biggest Malls in the World: Will Higher Interest Rates Bankrupt The Industry?,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-biggest-malls-world-higher-182320121.html,1669487000,STORY,['WMT'],"[In this article, we take a look at the 11 biggest Malls in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the state of the mall industry amid rising interest rates and go directly to the 5 Biggest Malls in the World.Mall Industry OutlookMalls are all about physical shopping in a building where you can find most retail stores and restaurants. The global mall market share was worth $5 trillion as of 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% during the period of 2022-2028 according to Grand View Research. The North American region has the highest share of the market at over 46%.Speaking of regions, the mall industry in Asia-Pacific region is projected to grow the fastest, at 6.7% CAGR for 2022-2028, presumably because of the growing middle class in India and China driving up consumer demand. Fast Moving Consumer Goods account for more than half of the malls’ global market size. When it comes to product-line market growth, the Apparels and Accessories segment is forecast to grow the fastest during 2022-2028, at a CAGR of 6.6%.However, as global mall trends show a rise in general, malls are on the decline in the US due to many factors, e-commerce being the oft-cited one.Further, according to a report by Coresight Research, 25% of the malls in the country would shut down most likely in the next five years amid persistent stagflation. Impact of Rate Hikes on Retail Real EstateAs the pre-Covid trends are making a comeback now that the pandemic is effectively over, the conventional wisdom would suggest that consumers would be returning to malls at pre-pandemic rate.However, as persistent inflation has led many central banks around the world to consecutively raise interest rates to bring it down, it has made it harder for consumers to save enough in their disposable income to sustain pre-pandemic shopping habits.Falling demand for retail items notwithstanding, in 2020, a large number of marginal tenants borrowed heavily to bolster their cash reserves in order to navigate the pandemic downturn. Retail companies accounted for $145 billion of the $252 billion withdrawn on revolving credit facilities. A large portion of this debt was short-term or variable rate debt (under 5 years). Story continuesAs a result, many retailers will probably have to pay more in interest over the next few years, which may limit their capacity to open more locations or make other investments in their existing businesses. This, combined with reduced spending by consumers, could deal a devastating blow to the industry’s balance sheets according to Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bankruptcies are uncommon when it comes to REITs in general but the risk to mall-owning REITs is relatively high. Two Mall REITs — CBL &amp; Associates and Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust — filed for bankruptcy in 2020 due to the Covid-related retail apocalypse, caused by lack of consumer demand. This time around, rising interest rates are leading to both the fall in demand, as well as harder retail debt-servicing. Despite experiencing increased cash flow and raising their dividends in 2022, REITs are down today by an average of 33%, and several individual REITs are down by more than 50%.It consequently has resulted in anxiety for mall-REITs. Some are already trying to adapt. The biggest US mall owner, Simon Property Group, has been reported to be negotiating with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to turn the space of closed Sears and J.C. Penney stores into fulfillment centers, regardless of the operational, legal and bureaucratic difficulties associated with rezoning buildings. No matter how attractive the malls are, people are increasingly turning to online shopping. The retail companies that are well-adapted are seeing their earnings grow online. For instance, the online sales of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) grew by 16% in the Q3 of its on-going fiscal year.11 Biggest Malls in the World: Will Higher Interest Rates Bankrupt The Industry?Photo by WeLoveBarcelona.de on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 11 biggest malls in the world, we’d be ranking them based on the gross leasable area. We’d also be mentioning the number of stores as well as anchor tenants in these malls. Lastly, we’d be discussing ownership in these malls. We'd be getting the data from the malls' websites.With that said, let’s move down to the 11 biggest malls in the world. 11. Mall of AmericaGross Leasable Area: 5.6 million sq feetMall of America is the largest mall in the United States. It is located in Bloomington, Minnesota. The shopping center has a retail space of 5.6 million square feet as of 2020. It has 520 retail stores, 50 restaurants, an aquarium and a theme park. Some of its prominent anchor tenants include Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M), IKEA and Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN). Simon Property Group held 50% ownership in Mall of America until it was found in violation of fiduciary duty to its partner, Triple Five, which led to the District Court of Minneapolis to order SPG to sell 27.5% stake to Triple Five, giving them control. The mall attracts roughly 40 million people annually, 80% of which are usually from Minnesota.Most of the retail products available on their platform are also available online at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).10. ICONSIAMGross Leasable Area: 5.6 million sq feetICONSIAM is located in Bangkok, Thailand, near the Chao Phraya River. Apart from hotels and residences, the building has one of the largest malls in Asia whose gross leasable area spans 5.65 million square feet. Among its anchor tenants, it has Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Apple Store and the Japanese multinational Takashimaya Company, Limited (TOKYO:8233.T).The mall was unveiled back in 2018 and has over 550 retail stores. Other tenants include Lotus’s and an art museum. ICONSIAM was ranked among the four best shopping malls around the world in the MIPIM 2021 award event at Cannes, France. ICONSIAM is jointly owned by Siam Piwat, the developer of Siam Paragon, MQDC Magnolia Quality Development Corporation and Charoen Pokphand Group. The total investment amounts to $1.5 billion.9. Central WorldGross Leasable Area: 5.9 million sq feetCentral World is another shopping mall from Bangkok, Thailand. With a total retail space of 5.9 million square feet, it grabs the ninth spot on the list of biggest malls in the world. It is owned by the Crown Property Bureau, a Thailand governmental body. Central World has 600 retail stores. Its anchor tenants include Apple Store of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Toys ‘R’ Us, owned, in part, by Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) and SuperSports. The plaza also has a cinema from SF Cinema Group, with 15 screens and 800 seats. Additionally, there’s five-star Centara Grand &amp; Bangkok Convention Centre at CentralWorld. 8. Central Plaza WestGateGross Leasable Area: 5.9 million sq feetCentral Plaza WestGate is yet another Thai shopping mall located in Bang Yai District and with 5.92 million square feet, it is the eighth biggest shopping mall in the world. It has over 650 retail stores. One of its anchor tenants, IKEA, alone has a floor area of nearly 550,000 square feet. Its other anchor tenants include PowerBuy, OfficeMate, SuperSports, Tops superstore, Uniqlo by Fast Retailing Co., Ltd.

The company presently runs 36 shopping centers across Thailand with a total retail space of 20 million square feet. 7. Golden Resources MallGross Leasable Area: 6 million sq feetGolden Resources Mall, also known as Jin Yuan, is one of the biggest shopping malls in China. It is located close to the Fourth Ring Road in Haidian District, Beijing. The mall has more than 750 retail stores and boasts six major anchor tenants. Other than that, there’s 20 mid-tenants, 600 apparel shops, 100 restaurants, 10 entertainment venues and a five-floor connected parking structure with 6800 parking spaces.6. SM Mall of AsiaGross Leasable Area: 6.3 million sq feetSM Mall of Asia is the largest mall in the Philippines and the sixth biggest in the world. It is located in Bay City, Pasay. It was developed and is owned by SM Prime Holdings, the biggest mall owner in the Philippines.  The mall has over 3,500 retail stores. It also features Power Mac Center, the premium reseller of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products.There’s also a 0.5 million square feet area reserved for social gatherings, which garners a daily mean foot traffic of about 0.2 million people. One of the most prominent attractions in the mall is the first ever IMAX theater in the Philippines. SM Mall of Asia has 16 anchor tenants and 217 fine-dining restaurants. It is a huge complex and has a variety of retail products available but it's dwarfed by the online retail scale of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).

One-month return of Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) was 14.31%, and its shares lost 9.43% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) has a market capitalization of $20.41 billion.Aristotle Capital made the following comment about Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL), the water equipment and services supplier, was a leading contributor for the quarter. The company’s solutions and technology continued to enjoy strong global demand as public utilities, as well as industrial, commercial and residential clients, seek solutions to treat, test, transport and preserve water. Similar to other industries, Xylem’s business has been impacted in the short term by the effects of inflation and chip‐supply constraints (that are now moderating), leading to an increasing backlog that has delayed the ability to fulfill orders. We believe Xylem’s portfolio of highly differentiated pumps, recognized for their quality and critical uses, as well as the company’s ability to cross‐sell and link other products, such as sensors and smart meters, will make it a one‐stop shop for utilities and protect the company from pure price competition. In our opinion, long‐term trends, such as water scarcity and the need to replace aging water infrastructure, create strong underlying demand for Xylem’s products through various parts of the economic cycle.”Story continuesPhoto by RephiLe water on UnsplashXylem Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the casino industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Casino Stocks to Buy for 2023.Over three years ago, the US Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment striking down the federal ban on sports betting. Since then, many states in the US legalized sports betting or are working on its legalization. This has resulted in the gambling and casino industry developing a whole new segment of online sports betting, one that has grown exponentially over the past few years and begun contributing significantly to the American economy.Companies in the gambling sector like Caesars Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) have always been around and have been performing well even before online sports betting became a contributor. However, since its legalization, the online gaming channel has helped the broader US gaming market bounce back from its downturn. According to a report on US online gaming published by MVB Bank this March, online sports betting accounted for over 80% of the all-time high of $4.29 billion in sports betting revenue in the US in 2021. It also generated an additional $3.71 billion in online casino revenue. This demonstrates the growing nature of this segment in the gaming industry, representing a lucrative investment opportunity for investors in the country.According to the American Gaming Association's Commercial Gaming Revenue Tracker report for the first quarter, gross gaming revenue (GGR) has been growing exponentially in the US between 2019 and 2022. The total gross gaming revenue in the first quarter stood at $14.31 billion, representing an increase of 33.9% from the GGR in the first quarter of 2019, and an increase of 28.6% from the same quarter in 2021. This year's first quarter was the industry's best start to a year according to this report, showcasing an acceleration in gaming revenue of almost 29% year-over-year. Consumer spending on gaming in the country has also remained robust despite inflationary concerns and a slower economy, showing that this industry is not only a profitable investment option, but also a reliable one for investors moving into 2023.Story continues14 best casino stocks to buy for 2023Photo by Kvnga on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected casino stocks with positive analyst ratings and price targets for our list below.

(NASDAQ:PENN) shares with an Equal Weight rating and a $36 price target on November 21.Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) has been performing well under tough macroeconomic conditions, and expects to remain profitable in 2023. In the third quarter, the company reported revenues of $1.6 billion, up 7.5% from the third quarter of 2021.

(NASDAQ:PENN) declined 9.6% in the quarter and penalized performance by 10 bps. This was due to investor concerns that a potential recession would result in a slowdown or decline in its earnings growth rate. However, thus far, the company has seen no material change to visitation or spending levels, and its earnings remain strong. PENN is generating strong cash flow, which it continues to use to invest in its digital growth opportunity, while using excess cash to buy back its stock. PENN is well positioned to weather a slowdown or recession, and we believe that even if one does occur, the company would still generate revenue and EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels. We consider the $50 million of losses this year from its digital business to be modest in relation to PENN’s over $1 billion of EBITDA from its casino business. The losses from its digital business represent customer acquisition costs incurred as additional states legalize online gambling. Since it is far less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, we expect marketing costs to decline as PENN builds its customer base. PENN’s core bricks and mortar casino business remains strong, and the company’s healthy regional casino business and strong balance sheet enable it to absorb its digital losses.”7.

Here's what the firm said:“VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust company specializing in casinos and other entertainment properties. We invested in VICI in 2018 when earnings were declining due to dilutive acquisitions. Our thesis was that, as investors grew more comfortable with casinos as a REIT subsector, the value of their properties would increase. We also liked the defensive characteristics of the company, specifically the triple-net lease structure, which dictates that lessees pay all maintenance and capital expenditures, and the history of casino REITs with zero rent payments missed by casinos during either the global financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic. Furthermore, we were confident that VICI’s growth prospects would increase as more casinos monetized land holdings with VICI’s ability to use its extensive cash and liquidity to make acquisitions. VICI’s stock outperformed in the quarter due to its appeal as a fairly defensive investment and the news that it would be included in the S&amp;P 500 Index. We maintained our position in VICI.”VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI), like Caesars Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), is a gambling stock many institutional investors are eyeing this year.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Casino Stocks to Buy for 2023.Suggested articles:16 Best Gambling Stocks To Buy15 Wealthiest Countries in the World15 Biggest Microchip Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 14 Best Casino Stocks to Buy for 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, MetLife's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for MetLife peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on MetLife.Is There Enough Growth For MetLife?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as MetLife's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 55%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 63% in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the twelve analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 47% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why MetLife is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On MetLife's P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that MetLife maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for MetLife (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you need to take into consideration.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

Such risks have pressed Russia to seek shorter routes via the Arctic Circle to send oil to Asia.The ban, aimed at punishing Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, will take effect on December 5. It will bar EU tankers from transporting, insuring and financing Russian oil shipments, meaning deliveries to alternative buyers in India, for example, could take 10 times as long.Here's how the EU embargo could impact Russian oil exports elsewhere.Russia turns to AsiaMoscow has been scrambling to find alternative buyers after crude shipments to northern Europe fell by 92% in the four weeks to November 18, signaling continental importers are already slashing their dependence on Russian oil.To make up for lost demand, Russia is now exporting record volumes to Asian nations, including to India and China. The country has surpassed Saudi Arabia and Iraq to become India's top crude supplier, while its energy exports to China soared 22% on-year in September.""One thing that we can be almost certain of is that Russia's pivot towards Asia will become more and more evident,"" Viktor Katona, a Kpler analyst told Insider.""Once Russia will no longer be allowed to transport its crude into the Mediterranean (exports into northwest Europe are already tangibly lower), the Asia-bound flows will only get bigger,"" he added.Story continuesLonger shipping routesRussia's increased dependence on Asian buyers means a recalibration of shipping dynamics. Oil cargoes heading to India and China must travel thousands of miles more compared to the routine voyage to Europe.""With more Asian discharges for Russian crude and products, the average voyage length will inevitably increase. Whilst a Russia Baltic-Rotterdam voyage took some 6-7 days, a trip from the same Russian port to India would be 35-40 days,"" Katona said.Tanker demandThat means increased demand for long-range tankers, which could squeeze the availability of such vessels and raise more logistical hurdles for Russia.""It could easily be five or six times the distance and that means that you'll need much more ships to transport the same volume that you imported previously,"" Anders Redigh Karlsen, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, told Bloomberg. ""That is going to drive demand for product tankers.""The effects of tight tanker demand are already being felt in the industry through surging freight rates. Bloomberg reported that earnings on the shipping industry's benchmark trade route breached $100,000 a day earlier this week, the highest since early 2020.Such challenges have prompted Russia to seek shorter shipping routes to Asia. Earlier this week, President Vladimir Putin touted the country's ""Arctic power"" with the launch of two nuclear-powered icebreakers that will benefit trade with Asia.Just this month, it sent an ice-breaker tanker of oil to China via the Arctic Circle in what is the shortest route between Europe and east Asia.That comes at a pivotal time for oil markets as OPEC+ reportedly mulls a crude output increase of 500,000 barrels. However, Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.Crude prices have dipped over the past five months as recession fears and China's COVID-19 policies weighed on demand. That's despite OPEC+ cutting production in a bid to support prices. Since mid-October when the oil group made the announcement, Brent crude has fallen about 9%.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

However, it restricts any cash payments to Venezuela, which could reduce the oil available to export.License terms are designed to prevent state-run oil firm Petróleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA, from receiving proceeds from Chevron's petroleum sales, U.S. officials said. The license lasts for six months and will be automatically renewed monthly thereafter, the U.S. Treasury said.The U.S. authorization ""brings added transparency to the Venezuelan oil sector"" and allows Chevron to benefit from sales of ""oil that is currently being produced"" by its joint ventures with PDVSA, the California-based company said in a statement.POLITICAL TALKSFollowing oil sanctions on Venezuela in 2019, Chevron received an exemption to trade its Venezuelan crude to recoup pending debts. But those privileges were suspended a year later. Chevron's four PDVSA joint ventures produced about 200,000 barrels per day of crude oil and exported the crude around the world prior to the sanctions.The United States issued the license on the same day that Venezuela and opposition leaders began a political dialogue in Mexico City by agreeing to ask the United Nations to oversee a fund providing food, healthcare and infrastructure to Venezuelans.Terms bar Chevron from helping the OPEC member develop new oilfields but provides a way for the company to recoup some of the billions of dollars owed by PDVSA through the oil sales. It also allows the U.S. company to import supplies to help process the country's crude oil into exportable grades.Oilfield service firms Baker Hughes, Halliburton, Schlumberger and Weatherford International had their U.S. licenses renewed but not expanded. That limits any wider expansion of Venezuelan oil production.Story continuesSpokespeople for the four, only two of which still have equipment in the country, did not immediately respond to requests for comment, or had no immediate comment.The United States, which first levied sanctions on PDVSA in 2017, said it reserved the right to rescind or revoke the license at any time. A spokesperson insisted the authorization was not a response to this year's sharp rise in energy prices.""This action reflects longstanding U.S. policy to provide targeted sanctions relief based on concrete steps that alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people and support the restoration of democracy,"" the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.The United States over the years has increased sanctions on Venezuela, seeking to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro over his 2018 reelection, which was not recognized by the west. Maduro has clung to power with the help of PDVSA, Russia and Iran.Maduro has gained new clout with the rise of leftist leaders in Latin America and a fractured opposition struggling from a lack of funds, and with leaders exiled or imprisoned.U.S. officials traveled to Caracas this year and held talks that led to the release of seven Americans held in Venezuelan jails in return for the release of two relatives of Maduro held on drug convictions.U.S. REFINERSThe authorization provides limited new supplies of crude to a market struggling to replace Russian barrels shunned by Western buyers over its invasion of Ukraine. Chevron and other U.S. oil refiners could benefit from supplies of Venezuela's heavy crude flowing to their U.S. Gulf Coast processing plants.Analysts cautioned that Maduro is likely to bristle at license restrictions, including the lack of cash payments that his administration sought.The authorization bans any payment of oil royalties and taxes to the Venezuelan government, or in-kind payments to PDVSA. It also bars Chevron from transactions with Russian-controlled companies operating in Venezuela.Terms will ""require significant reporting by Chevron on financial operations of their joint ventures to ensure transparency,"" a U.S. official said, adding that other sanctions on Venezuela and its officials remain in place.""There is not a big incentive in the short term"" for Venezuela, said Francisco Monaldi, an expert on Latin American energy policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. Terms could be relaxed over time, he added.""We'll see how Maduro's government reacts to it and how many cargoes will be assigned to Chevron after,"" Monaldi said.The United States earlier this year began considering Chevron's request to expand operations with more urgency as Washington sought oil to replace supplies hit by sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and more recently as OPEC cut its output.Venezuela holds about 300 billion barrels of oil reserves, the world's largest, but has been unable to hit its production targets due to underinvestment, poor maintenance, lack of supplies and U.S. sanctions.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga and Daphne Psaledakis; Writing by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Richard Chang)]"

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Morgan StanleyThe insider, Eric Grossman, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$102 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$90.91. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.All up, insiders sold more shares in Morgan Stanley than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Morgan Stanley Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Morgan Stanley insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$401m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Morgan Stanley Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Morgan Stanley insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Morgan Stanley insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock slipped this week after Politico reported the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is likely to file an antitrust lawsuit to block Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) $69 billion takeover bid, which would be the biggest in the history of the gaming industry.""We are committed to continuing to work cooperatively with regulators around the globe to allow the transaction to proceed, but won't hesitate to fight to defend the transaction if required,"" an Activision Blizzard spokesperson said, according to Reuters.

With shares of 8x8 and RingCentral down down some 75% and 81.5%, respectively, for the year, investors have been calling for consolidation in the sector, a separate source relayed. However, it is unclear if the 8x8 board of directors would be open to a deal with its share price depressed.Given the heavy debt loads of both companies, a cash deal may be hard for investors to swallow.

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Archer-Daniels-Midland's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Archer-Daniels-Midland is:17% = US$4.1b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.17.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Archer-Daniels-Midland's Earnings Growth And 17% ROETo start with, Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 14%. This certainly adds some context to Archer-Daniels-Midland's decent 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Archer-Daniels-Midland's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 7.0% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Archer-Daniels-Midland's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Archer-Daniels-Midland has a three-year median payout ratio of 39%, which implies that it retains the remaining 61% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Moreover, Archer-Daniels-Midland is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 34% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Archer-Daniels-Midland's future ROE will drop to 10.0% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Archer-Daniels-Midland's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

Insiders would probably have been better off holding on to their shares given that the average selling price of US$46.02 is still lower than the current share price.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SchlumbergerIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Vice President of Geographies, Khaled Al Mogharbel, sold US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$54.85 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$50.83. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Schlumberger insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Schlumberger Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Schlumberger shares. In total, insiders dumped US$6.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Schlumberger insiders own about US$137m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Schlumberger Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Schlumberger stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Schlumberger is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Schlumberger and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Media Companies in the World in 2022.The global media industry is worth nearly $2.3 trillion and is among the biggest industries in the world. It is also easily among the most important industries in the world as it plays an integral role in the promotion and dissemination of information. The media industry consists of broadcasting companies which can include the internet, radio, television and print, though the latter is a dying industry with the introduction of technology and cheaper, more efficient methods of distribution.The outlook of the entertainment and media company is quite positive, with PwC forecasting that the industry will be worth nearly $3 trillion in 2026. In fact, it is expected to grow much faster than the global economy. Just like any other industry, the media segment took a bit hit in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic but has shown a strong recovery since and is expected to post a CAGR of 4.6%.One of the changes we've seen in the industry which has been accelerated recently by the pandemic is consumption of media from home via digital channels. Even as the pandemic has started to wane, digital growth is continuing to increase. We've already seen a market shift in terms of media consumption with streaming emerging as the area with the highest growth. While Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) can be considered to be the pioneer in this regard, many other companies have realized the potential of engaging in streaming services.

(NASDAQ:NFLX).The biggest media companies in the world wield an incredible amount of power and influence. The companies in our list have a combined market cap of over $700 billion.

The dividend yield will be 4.8% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Newmont Newmont Is Paying Out More Than It Is EarningIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Before making this announcement, the company's dividend was much higher than its earnings. Without profits and cash flows increasing, it would be difficult for the company to continue paying the dividend at this level.Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 46.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues on its recent course, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 174%, which is a bit high and could start applying pressure to the balance sheet.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $1.40, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.20. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.6% per annum over that time. Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.Newmont Might Find It Hard To Grow Its DividendWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Newmont has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 51% per annum. Strong earnings is nice to see, but unless this can be sustained on minimal reinvestment of profits, we would question whether dividends will follow suit.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Newmont's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. Strong earnings growth means Newmont has the potential to be a good dividend stock in the future, despite the current payments being at elevated levels. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the casino industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Casino Stocks to Buy for 2023.Over three years ago, the US Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment striking down the federal ban on sports betting. Since then, many states in the US legalized sports betting or are working on its legalization. This has resulted in the gambling and casino industry developing a whole new segment of online sports betting, one that has grown exponentially over the past few years and begun contributing significantly to the American economy.Companies in the gambling sector like Caesars Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) have always been around and have been performing well even before online sports betting became a contributor. However, since its legalization, the online gaming channel has helped the broader US gaming market bounce back from its downturn. According to a report on US online gaming published by MVB Bank this March, online sports betting accounted for over 80% of the all-time high of $4.29 billion in sports betting revenue in the US in 2021. It also generated an additional $3.71 billion in online casino revenue. This demonstrates the growing nature of this segment in the gaming industry, representing a lucrative investment opportunity for investors in the country.According to the American Gaming Association's Commercial Gaming Revenue Tracker report for the first quarter, gross gaming revenue (GGR) has been growing exponentially in the US between 2019 and 2022. The total gross gaming revenue in the first quarter stood at $14.31 billion, representing an increase of 33.9% from the GGR in the first quarter of 2019, and an increase of 28.6% from the same quarter in 2021. This year's first quarter was the industry's best start to a year according to this report, showcasing an acceleration in gaming revenue of almost 29% year-over-year. Consumer spending on gaming in the country has also remained robust despite inflationary concerns and a slower economy, showing that this industry is not only a profitable investment option, but also a reliable one for investors moving into 2023.Story continues14 best casino stocks to buy for 2023Photo by Kvnga on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected casino stocks with positive analyst ratings and price targets for our list below.

With shares valued at only 8 times 2023 estimated cash flow (EBITDA) and a double-digit free cash flow yield, we think Red Rock’s share price is compelling.”12.

The company is based in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania.Morgan Stanley's Stephen Grambling initiated coverage of Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) shares with an Equal Weight rating and a $36 price target on November 21.Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) has been performing well under tough macroeconomic conditions, and expects to remain profitable in 2023. In the third quarter, the company reported revenues of $1.6 billion, up 7.5% from the third quarter of 2021.

(NASDAQ:PENN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Shares of gaming company PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) declined 9.6% in the quarter and penalized performance by 10 bps. This was due to investor concerns that a potential recession would result in a slowdown or decline in its earnings growth rate. However, thus far, the company has seen no material change to visitation or spending levels, and its earnings remain strong. PENN is generating strong cash flow, which it continues to use to invest in its digital growth opportunity, while using excess cash to buy back its stock. PENN is well positioned to weather a slowdown or recession, and we believe that even if one does occur, the company would still generate revenue and EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels. We consider the $50 million of losses this year from its digital business to be modest in relation to PENN’s over $1 billion of EBITDA from its casino business. The losses from its digital business represent customer acquisition costs incurred as additional states legalize online gambling. Since it is far less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, we expect marketing costs to decline as PENN builds its customer base. PENN’s core bricks and mortar casino business remains strong, and the company’s healthy regional casino business and strong balance sheet enable it to absorb its digital losses.”7. Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Limited (NASDAQ:MLCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Limited (NASDAQ:MLCO) develops, owns, and operates casino gambling and resort facilities.

Here's what the firm said:“VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust company specializing in casinos and other entertainment properties. We invested in VICI in 2018 when earnings were declining due to dilutive acquisitions. Our thesis was that, as investors grew more comfortable with casinos as a REIT subsector, the value of their properties would increase. We also liked the defensive characteristics of the company, specifically the triple-net lease structure, which dictates that lessees pay all maintenance and capital expenditures, and the history of casino REITs with zero rent payments missed by casinos during either the global financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic. Furthermore, we were confident that VICI’s growth prospects would increase as more casinos monetized land holdings with VICI’s ability to use its extensive cash and liquidity to make acquisitions. VICI’s stock outperformed in the quarter due to its appeal as a fairly defensive investment and the news that it would be included in the S&amp;P 500 Index. We maintained our position in VICI.”VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI), like Caesars Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), is a gambling stock many institutional investors are eyeing this year.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Casino Stocks to Buy for 2023.Suggested articles:16 Best Gambling Stocks To Buy15 Wealthiest Countries in the World15 Biggest Microchip Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 14 Best Casino Stocks to Buy for 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
24,a2766b0d-9c1b-3c5b-aab1-b01c7ff21781,NEE,2022-11-27,3 Renewable Energy Stocks Paying Dividends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-renewable-energy-stocks-paying-155626515.html,1669218986,STORY,"['ORA', 'NEE-PR', 'AY']","[One trend that has accelerated in recent years is the focus on using environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to make investment decisions. Many investors are now using a company’s performance on these ESG pillars to make their investment decisions.In 2021, the number of inflows into ESG-focused funds worldwide was estimated at $596.2 billion. This is more than double the $285 billion that was poured into these funds in 2019. Net assets totaled just over $18 billion last year but could reach as high as $34 billion by 2026 and make up more than one-fifth of total assets.Clearly, ESG investing isn’t just the latest investment fad but a trend that should grow at a high rate in the near term. Investors can profit from ESG dividend stocks is by focusing on those companies that are more environmentally friendly. This includes those companies that are increasing their renewable energy footprint, which should not only help the environment but also enable companies to grow their dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThree of our favorite renewable energy dividend stocks include:AYAtlantica Sustainable$27.97NEENextEra Energy$83.76ORAOrmat Technologies$89.63Atlantica Sustainable (AY)Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit upSource: ShutterstockThe first utility name to consider is U.K.-based Atlantica Sustainable (NASDAQ:AY), a sustainable infrastructure company. Atlantica Sustainable has a wide footprint, with operations in North America; South America; and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). The EMEA region makes up nearly half of revenue so far in 2022, with North America the next largest market. The company is valued at $3.1 billion and the generates annual revenue of just over $1 billion.Atlantica Sustainable is highly focused on investing and operating renewable energy assets in an effort to become one of the top names in sustainable energy. The company has 41 assets, which include renewable energy sources as well as transmission and transport, efficient natural gas and water projects.Story continuesIn total, Atlantica Sustainable’s assets have 2,121 megawatt (MW) of aggregate renewable energy installed generation capacity, 343 MW of efficient natural gas power generation capacity, and 55 megawatt thermal (MWt) district heating capacity. The company also has more than 1,200 miles of electric transmission lines and has the capacity to desalinate 17.5 million cubic feet per day.The company does have a natural gas business, so Atlantica Sustainable isn’t exactly a pure play on renewable energy. That said, renewable energy contributes more than three-quarters of annual revenue, making these assets the largest business within the company. Efficient gas and heat and transmission lines each contribute slightly more than 10% of revenue, with water the remainder.The company’s assets usually have agreements in place for revenue, with more than half of contracts linked to inflation or indexed to a fixed number of rate escalations over time. Therefore, Atlantica Sustainable is less susceptible to the impact of inflation than its peer group. The company also has a weighted average contract life of 15 years, giving Atlantica Sustainable a somewhat predictable picture of where revenue will come from over the long term.Atlantica Sustainable has enjoyed a solid 2022. Through the end of the third-quarter, gigawatt hours (GWh) produced by renewable energy assets has increased 20% to 4,155 and by 14% for efficient natural gas and heat. Transmission lines in operation are higher by 5.4% to 1,229 miles. Operating cash flow is higher by almost 17%. With such strong results, we believe that the stock’s 6.5% yield is safe and that the seven-year dividend growth streak is very likely to continue.NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comOur next pick for renewable energy is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), an electric utility company based primarily in Florida. The company consists of three segments, including Florida Power &amp; Light, Gulf Power and NextEra Energy Resources. The $167 billion company has annual revenue in excess of $17 billion.The first two segments are rate-regulated electric utilities that have nearly 6 million customer accounts covering more than 11 million residents. These businesses are more typical in that they have more predictable revenue and earnings. They are also reliant on regulatory approval for rate increases. Florida Power &amp; Light and Gulf Power make up more than two-thirds of revenue.NextEra Energy Resources contributes the remainder of revenue. This business is focused on wind and solar energy. NextEra Energy is the largest generator of energy from wind and sun in the world. In addition, the company is the no. 1 name in battery storage.NextEra Energy Resources has 64 GW of generating capacity in operation and continues to expand aggressively. As of the most recent quarter, NextEra Energy had 2,345 MW of new renewable and storage origination. Management believes that this trend will continue as it projects a total origination of 27,700 to 36,900 MW between 2022 and 2025. The company’s backlog stood at 20,000 MW as of the end of the third quarter.Looking long term, management believes that there is immense opportunity for the company to take advantage of decarbonization. In the U.S. alone, NextEra Energy believes that the drive to reduce emissions and lower customer bills is a $2 trillion market. As the largest provider of renewable energy in the world, this has NextEra Energy well positioned to tap into what should be a major market.Shares of the company yield just 2%, much lower than the typical utility stock. However, NextEra Energy has a much larger runway for growth given the size of its renewable business. With a dividend growth streak of 26 years, NextEra Energy is one of just three utility companies in the Dividend Aristocrat index.Ormat Technologies (ORA)Storage tanks and pipelines of an Ormat Technologies (OAR) Geothermal Power Station in Wairakei, New Zealand.Source: riekephotos / Shutterstock.comOur final renewable pick is Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA), which provides geothermal and recovered energy power and products to customers. In addition to power generation and storage, the company also markets equipment to others in the renewable energy business. Ormat Technologies has operations in nearly a dozen countries, including the U.S., Turkey, New Zealand and Indonesia. The company is valued at $5.6 billion. It produced revenue of $582 million in 2021.The majority of the company’s MW are located in the U.S. However, the remainder of its operations are closely distributed among the countries that Ormat Technologies operate in. The company is also pursuing growth opportunities throughout its portfolio. For example, Ormat Technologies signed agreements totaling $137.1 million in its most recent quarter. This is a 150% increase from the prior period.It’s not just the U.S. that is experiencing increased demand. Much of the additional backlog in the quarter comes from a $100 million agreement with New Zealand and Indonesia.So far in 2022, Ormat Technologies has added 73 MW to its global portfolio, bringing the total to 1,085 MW. The company has also seen a 6.6% increase in generation to 1,624 GW hours. Ormat Technologies expects to add another 100 to 110 MW by the end of next year.The company forecast that it will be able to significantly increase it geothermal and solar capacity by the end of 2023 and become one of the leading names in the U.S. storage sector. By the end of next year, Ormat Technologies estimates that it can increase geothermal and solar energy production by 18%. Energy storage will likely to be up three times what it was in 2021.Shares of Ormat Technologies have increased 27% over the year. This has caused the dividend yield to fall to just 0.5%. The company’s dividend growth history is more uneven than our other renewable energy picks as the dividend has been cut several times over the last decade, most recently in 2018.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Roth IRA Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.A Roth individual retirement account (IRA) allows you to contribute after-tax dollars into an account that can keep on growing tax-free. The account gives you the option to withdraw the amount penalty-free after the age of 59½. However, the Roth IRA must be opened for five years before the withdrawal can be made. Roth IRA does not require a minimum contribution, and there is no age limit on when the contribution can be made. The only qualifying factor is that a single filer should earn less than $144,000 in 2022 and $153,000 annually in 2023 to make a deposit to the Roth IRA. Meanwhile, married couples can contribute to a Roth IRA if they earn less than $214,000 in 2022 and $228,000 in 2023 together. The contributions made to the Roth IRA can be used for emergency purposes. However, it must be noted that only contributions can be withdrawn at any time and not the amount of profit generated from the amount deposited.In times of raging inflation, investors are looking towards using a Roth IRA to protect their investment gains from taxes. Some of the best Roth IRA stocks attracting hedge fund investment as of Q3 2022 include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our MethodologyWe scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds and picked the most popular Roth IRA stocks among these elite hedge funds. These Roth IRA stocks provide investors with an opportunity to diversify their portfolios and earn healthy returns. The list includes stocks from different sectors ranging from consumer discretionary, energy, financial, and technology.Best Roth IRA Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds10. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a London, UK-based integrated energy company with a global presence. The company is making an aggressive move in lowering its reliance on conventional energy sources like crude oil and natural gas and transitioning towards renewable energy sources like wind and solar. This emerging theme is unfolding currently and could be at its peak in the next two to three decades.Story continuesIn a research note issued on November 11, Ryan Todd at Piper Sandler increased the price target on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) from $65 to $71 and maintained an Overweight rating on the stock. The analyst highlighted that the Q3 2022 results were very positive for the integrated energy companies. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) has seen an improvement in shareholder returns and has significantly improved cash flow generation during the third quarter. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) can be considered one of the best Roth IRA stocks as it offers an attractive forward dividend yield of 3.58% as of November 25. The company has also started a $4 billion share buyback plan on October 27 that is expected to be completed in the next three months.Third Point Management shared its outlook on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We have continued to add to our position in Shell, as it trades at the same deeply discounted multiple today that it did last year due to a move up in commodity prices. We are engaged in discussions with management, board members, and other shareholders, as well as informal talks with financial advisors. We have discussed various alternatives with the aim of both increasing shareholder value and allowing Shell to effectively manage the energy transition. We have reiterated our view that Shell’s portfolio of disparate businesses ranging from deep water oil to wind farms to gas stations to chemical plants is confusing and unmanageable. Most investors we have discussed this with agree that the company would be more successful over the long term with a different corporate structure. Discussions among the parties have been constructive and will be ongoing since stakeholders clearly see these corporate changes as instrumental, particularly if Shell wishes to become a leader in the energy transition rather than be left behind as a tarnished legacy brand.Beyond our discussions around corporate structure, there have been two important developments since our last update. First, Shell announced a plan to redomicile its headquarters to the UK and create a single shareholder class. This move allows greater flexibility to modify its portfolio (either through asset sales or spin-offs) and allows for a more efficient return of capital, specifically via share repurchases. Second, fundamental and geopolitical events have highlighted the strategic importance of reliable energy supplies, especially in Europe. Shell’s LNG business, the largest in the world outside of Qatar, will play a critical role in ensuring energy security for Europe. In our view, the value of this business has increased dramatically since our original investment.While Shell continues to trade at a large discount to its intrinsic value, with proper management we believe the company can simultaneously deliver shareholder returns, reliable energy and decarbonization of the global economy. We look forward to continued engagement with management and other shareholders and to more strategic clarity from the Company.”9. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) is a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based natural gas producer with a focus on the Appalachian Basin. The company has the distinction of being the biggest natural gas producer in the US.On November 17, Mark Lear at Piper Sandler increased the target price for EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) from $62 to $63 and maintained an Overweight rating on the stock. The target price reflects a potential upside of over 51% from the closing price as of November 25. Lear revised the target price following the amendments made to the exploration and production (E&amp;P) models after the company’s Q3 2022 results. The analyst observed that EQT Corporation's (NYSE:EQT) primary focus has been on enhancing capital returns through disciplined allocation. However, the E&amp;P companies could incur higher capital expenditure (CAPEX) due to increasing service costs in Q4 2022 and 2023.ClearBridge Investments presented its positive outlook on EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We also added natural gas company EQT (NYSE:EQT) in the energy sector. As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”According to the data compiled by Insider Monkey, Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners is the biggest hedge fund holder of EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) stock with a stake of around $263.2 million as of Q3 2022.8.

Each stock was up 1% in the quarter compared to the 16% price decline for the S&amp;P 500 and the positions were reduced as the valuations became somewhat less appealing, though still attractive enough to warrant inclusion.”Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was held by 85 hedge funds at the end of the third quarter of 2022.7. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an Austin, Texas-based manufacturer of electric vehicles led by billionaire Elon Musk.Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley believes that the current price of Tesla, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) for individuals looking to invest in the best Roth IRA stocks.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds discussed its stance on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Here’s what the firm said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful.Regardless, I was right to have spoken with Roger. That was since he outlined numerous issues we needed to consider, study, and question before we determined whether we believed Tesla could be a successful business…before we ultimately chose whether to invest in that company.When we completed our initial due diligence on Tesla, which diligence has been ongoing since 2014, we decided to invest $360 million in Tesla over the next two years. I then called Roger and outlined why I thought we could earn 20 times our capital over the next 10 years. Roger was so certain I was wrong that he offered to bet me $1 million that Tesla would fail. “Roger, I can’t bet you a million dollars. First, if you are right, I couldn’t afford to pay you. Second, if I’m right, you’re my friend, and I couldn’t take your money.” We settled on a dinner bet…” (Click here to see the full text)6. T-Mobile US, Inc.

27,a1426bb9-fcff-38ed-a660-3ee1341f60fb,MDT,2022-11-27,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-medtronic-plc-110028558.html,1669546828,STORY,['MDT'],"[How far off is Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.82bUS$6.10bUS$5.78bUS$6.93bUS$7.40bUS$7.76bUS$8.07bUS$8.35bUS$8.59bUS$8.82bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.86%Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.39%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$5.4kUS$5.2kUS$4.6kUS$5.1kUS$5.0kUS$4.8kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.2kUS$4.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$47bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$146bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$146b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$66bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$114b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$79.1, the company appears about fair value at a 7.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.023. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Medtronic, we've put together three fundamental items you should further research:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Medtronic .Future Earnings: How does MDT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

28,cd5749fe-de7b-3715-8302-181e15052068,CCI,2022-11-27,Is Crown Castle Inc.'s (NYSE:CCI) ROE Of 21% Impressive?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-inc-nyse-cci-140036199.html,1669471236,STORY,['CCI'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Crown Castle How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Crown Castle is:21% = US$1.6b ÷ US$7.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.21 in profit.Does Crown Castle Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Crown Castle has a superior ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry.roeThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Crown Castle by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Crown Castle's Debt And Its 21% Return On EquityCrown Castle does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.77. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Crown Castle may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock slipped this week after Politico reported the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is likely to file an antitrust lawsuit to block Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) $69 billion takeover bid, which would be the biggest in the history of the gaming industry.""We are committed to continuing to work cooperatively with regulators around the globe to allow the transaction to proceed, but won't hesitate to fight to defend the transaction if required,"" an Activision Blizzard spokesperson said, according to Reuters. ""We are prepared to address the concerns of regulators, including the FTC, and Sony (NYSE:SONY) to ensure the deal closes with confidence,"" said Microsoft’s spokesperson, per Reuters. Activision shares were down 4.1% following the news Friday, and off 0.9% for the week, to $73.47. Microsoft added 1.7%.2. RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) has approached 8x8 Inc (NASDAQ:EGHT) about a potential takeover, according to a source cited by Investing.com. RingCentral is said to be working with an investment bank to evaluate a potential transaction. The news followed a report from Investing.com last week that 8X8 was approached by a strategic buyer. With shares of 8x8 and RingCentral down down some 75% and 81.5%, respectively, for the year, investors have been calling for consolidation in the sector, a separate source relayed. However, it is unclear if the 8x8 board of directors would be open to a deal with its share price depressed.Given the heavy debt loads of both companies, a cash deal may be hard for investors to swallow. However, a stock-for-stock deal could be one potential option. RingCentral said it does not comment on rumors or speculation. 8x8 has not responded to a request to comment on the rumor. RingCentral shares sank 6.3% for the week to $35.60. 8x8 shares were down 2.1% to $4.30.Story continues3.

This is a sector that’s seen its valuation multiples decline in many cases to a greater extent than the overall market.Thus, while many biotech stocks exhibit strong growth trajectories, these companies often trade at bargain prices. Much of that has to do with the necessarily high research &amp; development expenditures these companies need to lay out over a very long period of time.That said, there are some long-term investors who continue to accumulate a number of quality biotech stocks at these levels. Following the pandemic, many investors realized the defensive growth characteristics of these companies are worth considering. Sure, speculative growth stocks are being thrown out. But I wouldn’t put most high-quality biotechs in the same bucket.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEven in this bear market, the biotech space has immense growth potential. Investors opting for this sector can certainly ramp up their risk on upside should the market rally. But even if the market declines further, given how far many of these stocks have fallen, I’d suggest the downside may be limited with some of these names.These are three of the top biotech stocks I think investors should look at right now.MRKMerck &amp; Co.$106.82NVSNovartis$87.29ARDXArdelyx$1.77Merck &amp; Co. (MRK)Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comMerck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK) is the fifth largest pharma company in the world based on its market capitalization of more than $270 billion. The company is well known for developing medications for life-threatening diseases like cancer. For example, its Keytruda is one of the most prevalent cancer medications. This medicine also forms one-third of the company’s overall sales.Now, this drug is just one of many in the company’s vast array of pharmaceuticals. Knowing that Merck has more than one jewel in its crown is important for investors to consider, given that concentration risk is a big deal. It’s expected that new drugs are likely to account for $1 billion in sales for 2022. Some of the company’s highest-selling products include Januvia, Janumet, Gardasil and Lagevrio.Story continuesMerck’s animal health segment also generates high sales (around $1 billion in third quarter 2022). Currently, the company is actively researching additional therapeutic medications. If everything turns out as planned, Merck has the potential for immense growth. As a result, the next five years could be highly rewarding for Merck and its investors. Merck may be able to sustain a double-digit growth rate over the next five years, which is almost double the projected growth rate for the sector.Trading at only 17x earnings with a dividend yield of 2.58%, MRK stock is about as high-quality a bet on defensive growth as investors can get in this market right now.Novartis (NVS)Novartis (NVS) logo on a corporate building during daylightSource: Denis Linine / Shutterstock.comThe ninth-largest biotech company is Novartis (NYSE:NVS), with a $188 billion market cap. With more than 14 top-selling products, Novartis should continue to show strong revenue growth over the long term.The company’s best-selling drugs are aimed at neurological, cardiovascular and immunological-oriented ailments. Its top-selling drug is Cosentyx, which makes up around 10% of its net sales. Like other players in this space, Novartis continues to invest heavily in research and development. Currently, the company has more than 140 projects in its pipeline. This number itself shows the exponential growth Novartis is likely to have in the coming years.These factors are great, but it’s the company’s dividend that I really like. With a current yield of 3.81%, this is about as high-quality of a bond-like proxy investors can want. Supported by excellent potential future cash flow growth, I have no doubt this rather cheap stock is worth a buy here.Currently, NVS stock trades at a price-earnings ratio of less than 10, which is incredible considering the quality of this business.Ardelyx (ARDX)pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factorySource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.comLast on this list of biotech stocks to buy is Ardelyx (NASDAQ:ARDX), a company famous for its popular drug Ibsrela. That said, there may be more to talk about when it comes to Ardelyx. That’s because the company is in the process of bringing a new experimental drug to market.This drug is likely to be named Xphozah, helping patients with chronic kidney disease. This medicine can be a game changer, as it helps regulate blood phosphorus levels for kidney patients on dialysis. Notably, the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) appears to be in Ardelyx’s corner when it comes to the drug. They voted 10 to 2 in favor of Xphozah being used in combination with other similar drugs. So, it’s likely we’ll see FDA clearance take hold some time in 2023.This drug’s immense potential is noteworthy. However, with a market capitalization of less than $350 million, there’s clearly plenty of risk being priced into this stock. Nothing is certain in the world of gaining approvals from the FDA.That said, among the more speculative biotech stocks out there, I think ARDX stock may be worth a small position at these levels. The company isn’t yet profitable, but with its potential upside, I think it merits a bet, even as a potential buyout target.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

31,73e567d3-6858-33cf-8951-dd1163d056a8,WMB,2022-11-27,"Can The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) Improve Its Returns?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-companies-inc-nyse-wmb-143203701.html,1669473123,STORY,['WMB'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Williams Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Williams Companies is:15% = US$2.1b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.15 in profit.Does Williams Companies Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Williams Companies has a lower ROE than the average (32%) in the Oil and Gas industry.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Williams Companies visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Williams Companies' Debt And Its 15% Return On EquityWilliams Companies does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.68. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course Williams Companies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

With prices finally starting to stabilize, some of the country’s top Wall Street firms are optimistic that the worst is over. However, not everyone holds that opinion. While the market may be enjoying a brief respite from inflation fears, many believe there is still the potential for substantial volatility in the upcoming months. Therefore, investing in dividend stocks in this inflationary environment seems like the best course of action for investors at this time.Despite the recent volatility in the stock market, dividend stocks remain attractive for those looking to generate passive income. Unlike other stocks, dividend stocks provide a steady stream of income that is generally less-impacted by short-term fluctuations in the macro environment. Additionally, dividend stocks tend to be less-volatile than the overall market, providing a measure of stability in uncertain times.For these reasons, dividend stocks are an ideal investment for those who want to protect their assets amidst an inflationary environment. Here are seven top options I think investors should consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMInternational Business Machines$149.10CVXChevron$185.89PRUPrudential$108.56BEPBrookfield Renewable Partners$28.63SOThe Southern Company$65.95ORealty Income$65.30VFCV.F. Corporation$33.67International Business Machines (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been an afterthought in the tech space for the past decade. Big Blue failed to evolve from its legacy hardware business, missing major technological trends. However, the new-look IBM seems to have its swagger back, and is poised for robust gains ahead.IBM is focusing on its hybrid cloud and AI solutions businesses, which continue to impress in each quarterly report. The firm is evolving into a data platform and cloud provider, and is positioned to ride the strong growth trends in the hybrid cloud space to new highs. Recent results have shown as much, with the company making massive strides in its software and hybrid cloud business lines.Story continuesRevenue growth for the year is already up an incredible 42%. This comes during a year where many tech stalwarts have stumbled. Layer that up with an attractive valuation and a dividend yield of roughly 4.5%, and you have a dividend stock that should be on the buy list right now.Chevron (CVX)Source: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.comShares of oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have taken a hit following the midterm elections. Market fears seem overblown at this point, as any minor regulatory changes shouldn’t impact the bottom lines of major energy giants.While the recent sell-off may have spooked some investors, those with a long-term perspective can view this as an opportunity to buy a high-quality dividend stock at a discount. Chevron offers a healthy 3.1% yield with a fantastic share buy back program as well.With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there is a considerable global oil and natural gas supply shortage. This key development makes it harder for continental Europe to power itself, throwing the spotlight on Chevron and its peers to cover the shortfall. Chevron has already had a stellar year on the back of higher oil prices, and will continue to shine as global energy demand remains strong.Prudential (PRU)Prudential logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPrudential (NYSE:PRU) is a great choice for dividend investors looking for stability and growth potential. The insurer has been in business for over 140 years and has weathered many economic downturns.Today, Prudential is one of the largest life insurers in the world, with operations in more than 40 countries. The company’s strong financials are underpinned by a well-diversified business model, which provides a degree of protection from economic volatility. Moreover, PRU stock boasts an alluring dividend yield of over 4.4%.In the first half of the year, Prudential’s net cash soared to roughly $1.5 billion. I think the company’s cash position provides a strong moat for the companies in uncertain times. Moreover, this cash position is advantageous, as it allows the company to take advantage of meaningfully higher interest rates as it invests cash from annuities and premiums in fixed-income instruments.Thus, Prudential is an attractive dividend stock with a robust business model to weather the current economic pressures.Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)The Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of a digital American flag background.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comBrookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is a leading global renewable energy company. Its mission is to create value by developing and operating a world-class renewable power portfolio. Brookfield owns a diversified portfolio of clean energy assets that provides stable, long-term cash flow and attractive returns to its investors. With its colossal addressable market, reliable cash flow growth, and healthy dividend increases, it remains the best bet in the renewable energy space.The firm boasts an excellent track record of superb margin growth. Some of its biggest catalysts include government incentives for clean energy and rapidly-increasing electricity demand. Of late, surging electricity prices have helped the business offset rising commodity costs. Moreover, it generates the bulk of its sales from 14-year contracts, adding substantial stability to its business outlook.The Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comUtility companies are often seen as a safe investment, and for good reason. They tend to be relatively stable, even during periods economic turmoil, offering solid dividends. The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is a great example of a utility stock that is likely to weather any market storms. The company has a strong history of paying dividends, and its revenue tends to be fairly consistent regardless of market conditions.Like other electric utilities, The Southern Company operates as a quasi-monopoly with a low risk of bankruptcy and stable cash flows. Moreover, its top and bottom lines are both expected to surge, given the electrification of transportation and the scope to enter into more profitable business areas. In addition to providing electricity and gas to its consumers, the company also offers fiber optic telecom services. Hence, its diversified offerings will help the company maintain its  top-notch dividend profile.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust that focuses on acquiring net leased commercial properties. Its operating strategy is pretty simple – the company buys properties and then leases them to tenants under long-term agreements. This provides consistent cash flow, allowing the company to pay regular dividends to shareholders.The firm boasts a spectacular track record of profitability which has helped provide its investors with a strong, consistent yield over the years.Realty’s dividend profile is enviable, to say the least, given it’s grown its payouts for over 25 consecutive years. Moreover, the odds suggest this REIT will effectively make it through the current downturn without any meaningful impact to its business model. Therefore, Realty Income is a high-quality REIT worth investing in at current levels.V.F.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Mid-America Apartment Communities'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Mid-America Apartment Communities How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mid-America Apartment Communities is:11% = US$647m ÷ US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.11 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Mid-America Apartment Communities' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo start with, Mid-America Apartment Communities' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 6.9% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Mid-America Apartment Communities was able to see a decent growth of 17% over the last five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Mid-America Apartment Communities' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is MAA worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MAA is currently mispriced by the market.Is Mid-America Apartment Communities Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Mid-America Apartment Communities seems to be paying out most of its income as dividends judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 58%, meaning the company retains only 42% of its income. However, this is typical for REITs as they are often required by law to distribute most of their earnings. In spite of this, the company was able to grow its earnings by a fair bit, as we saw above.Besides, Mid-America Apartment Communities has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 57% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 10%.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Mid-America Apartment Communities' performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

35,92912055-0c19-3bd3-8108-7dd1ed30a881,NKE,2022-11-27,NIKE (NYSE:NKE) Is Reinvesting At Lower Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-nyse-nke-reinvesting-lower-110012069.html,1669546812,STORY,['NKE'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at NIKE (NYSE:NKE), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on NIKE is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$6.2b ÷ (US$41b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2022).So, NIKE has an ROCE of 21%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for NIKE roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NIKE compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for NIKE.What Can We Tell From NIKE's ROCE Trend?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at NIKE doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 26% where it was five years ago. However it looks like NIKE might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.The Key TakeawayBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by NIKE's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 85% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesIf you're still interested in NIKE it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

With prices finally starting to stabilize, some of the country’s top Wall Street firms are optimistic that the worst is over. However, not everyone holds that opinion. While the market may be enjoying a brief respite from inflation fears, many believe there is still the potential for substantial volatility in the upcoming months. Therefore, investing in dividend stocks in this inflationary environment seems like the best course of action for investors at this time.Despite the recent volatility in the stock market, dividend stocks remain attractive for those looking to generate passive income. Unlike other stocks, dividend stocks provide a steady stream of income that is generally less-impacted by short-term fluctuations in the macro environment. Additionally, dividend stocks tend to be less-volatile than the overall market, providing a measure of stability in uncertain times.For these reasons, dividend stocks are an ideal investment for those who want to protect their assets amidst an inflationary environment.

This comes during a year where many tech stalwarts have stumbled.

Market fears seem overblown at this point, as any minor regulatory changes shouldn’t impact the bottom lines of major energy giants.While the recent sell-off may have spooked some investors, those with a long-term perspective can view this as an opportunity to buy a high-quality dividend stock at a discount. Chevron offers a healthy 3.1% yield with a fantastic share buy back program as well.With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there is a considerable global oil and natural gas supply shortage. This key development makes it harder for continental Europe to power itself, throwing the spotlight on Chevron and its peers to cover the shortfall.

Moreover, PRU stock boasts an alluring dividend yield of over 4.4%.In the first half of the year, Prudential’s net cash soared to roughly $1.5 billion. I think the company’s cash position provides a strong moat for the companies in uncertain times.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Media Companies in the World in 2022.The global media industry is worth nearly $2.3 trillion and is among the biggest industries in the world. It is also easily among the most important industries in the world as it plays an integral role in the promotion and dissemination of information.

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines International Business Machines Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent sale by Robert Del Bene is the biggest insider sale of International Business Machines shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$148). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 17%of Robert Del Bene's holding.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 1.08k shares for US$135k. But insiders sold 4.60k shares worth US$668k. Robert Del Bene divested 4.60k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$145. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.International Business Machines Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at International Business Machines. In total, insider Robert Del Bene sold US$445k worth of shares in that time. On the flip side, Independent Director David Farr spent US$125k on purchasing shares. Generally this level of net selling might be considered a bit bearish.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that International Business Machines insiders own 0.08% of the company, worth about US$105m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The International Business Machines Insider Transactions Indicate?Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of International Business Machines stock, than buying, in the last three months. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To that end, you should learn about the 5 warning signs we've spotted with International Business Machines (including 1 which is potentially serious).Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.40bUS$6.86bUS$5.61bUS$5.80bUS$5.29bUS$4.99bUS$4.82bUS$4.74bUS$4.71bUS$4.71bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -8.91%Est @ -5.64%Est @ -3.35%Est @ -1.75%Est @ -0.63%Est @ 0.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% US$7.7kUS$5.7kUS$4.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.3kUS$2.8kUS$2.5kUS$2.2kUS$2.0kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.8%– 2.0%) = US$61bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$61b÷ ( 1 + 9.8%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$60b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$125, the company appears about fair value at a 2.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marathon Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.530. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Marathon Petroleum, we've put together three fundamental factors you should explore:Risks: For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does MPC's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. In this article, we decided to focus on Analog Devices'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:7.5% = US$2.7b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Analog Devices' Earnings Growth And 7.5% ROEWhen you first look at it, Analog Devices' ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 19%. However, the moderate 12% net income growth seen by Analog Devices over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Analog Devices' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 27% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is ADI worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether ADI is currently mispriced by the market.Is Analog Devices Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?While Analog Devices has a three-year median payout ratio of 75% (which means it retains 25% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Additionally, Analog Devices has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 41% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 16%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we have mixed feelings about Analog Devices. Although the company has shown a fair bit of growth in earnings, the reinvestment rate is low. Meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits and reinvesting that at a higher rate of return. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Amphenol’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Amphenol Is Amphenol Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 21%, trading at US$80.34 compared to my intrinsic value of $66.18. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Amphenol’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Amphenol generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Amphenol's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in APH’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe APH should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on APH for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for APH, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Snap-on's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Snap-on How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Snap-on is:21% = US$919m ÷ US$4.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Snap-on's Earnings Growth And 21% ROEAt first glance, Snap-on seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. Probably as a result of this, Snap-on was able to see a decent growth of 8.0% over the last five years.We then performed a comparison between Snap-on's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 7.3% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for SNA? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Snap-on Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Snap-on has a three-year median payout ratio of 34%, which implies that it retains the remaining 66% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Additionally, Snap-on has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 40%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 18%.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Snap-on's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for KLA How Quickly Is KLA Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. To the delight of shareholders, KLA has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 48%, compound, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of KLA shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 37% to 40% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for KLA.Story continuesAre KLA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since KLA has a market capitalisation of US$54b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. With a whopping US$86m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Should You Add KLA To Your Watchlist?KLA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering KLA for a spot on your watchlist. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for KLA  that you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

47,1dfc564c-de07-34b9-8ab6-352d636712c5,TPR,2022-11-27,Tapestry's (NYSE:TPR) three-year earnings growth trails the 14% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tapestrys-nyse-tpr-three-earnings-135037572.html,1669470637,STORY,['TPR'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) share price is up 38% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 25% (not including dividends).After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Tapestry In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Tapestry was able to grow its EPS at 22% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 11% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 10.83 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Tapestry's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Tapestry's TSR for the last 3 years was 47%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Tapestry returned a loss of 8.7% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 17%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 0.5% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Tapestry   you should know about.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) Looks Interesting, And It's About To Pay A Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-worldwide-inc-123209941.html,1669552329,STORY,['CHRW'],"[C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, C.H. Robinson Worldwide investors that purchase the stock on or after the 1st of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of January.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.61 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.20 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has a trailing yield of approximately 2.2% on its current stock price of $98.76. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately C.H. Robinson Worldwide's payout ratio is modest, at just 26% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 34% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that C.H. Robinson Worldwide's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see C.H. Robinson Worldwide has grown its earnings rapidly, up 20% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. C.H. Robinson Worldwide has delivered 5.2% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because C.H. Robinson Worldwide is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business.The Bottom LineIs C.H. Robinson Worldwide an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that C.H. Robinson Worldwide is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for C.H. Robinson Worldwide (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

52,f99f3ffd-4bec-3ba7-93c5-53015a36d4ae,CMI,2022-11-27,An Intrinsic Calculation For Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) Suggests It's 48% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-cummins-inc-nyse-140736097.html,1669471656,STORY,['CMI'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cummins Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.38bUS$2.98bUS$3.42bUS$3.80bUS$4.12bUS$4.38bUS$4.61bUS$4.80bUS$4.97bUS$5.12bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Est @ 14.92%Est @ 11.04%Est @ 8.32%Est @ 6.42%Est @ 5.09%Est @ 4.15%Est @ 3.5%Est @ 3.05% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$2.2kUS$2.6kUS$2.7kUS$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$89bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$89b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$41bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$68b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$250, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cummins as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.149. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Cummins, we've compiled three pertinent aspects you should explore:Risks: Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for Cummins  you should be aware of.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for CMI's future outlook?

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Hasbro, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$766m ÷ (US$9.6b - US$2.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Hasbro has an ROCE of 11%. In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Leisure industry average of 21%, it's not as good. See our latest analysis for Hasbro roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Hasbro compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Hasbro here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Hasbro's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 21%, but since then they've fallen to 11%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Hasbro's ROCEIn summary, Hasbro is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has declined 22% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. Therefore based on the analysis done in this article, we don't think Hasbro has the makings of a multi-bagger.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Hasbro and understanding these should be part of your investment process.While Hasbro isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:PLD)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-140024381.html,1669471224,STORY,['PLD'],"[With its stock down 9.3% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Prologis (NYSE:PLD). But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Prologis'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Prologis How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prologis is:11% = US$4.2b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.11 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Prologis' Earnings Growth And 11% ROEAt first glance, Prologis seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 6.9% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for Prologis' moderate 17% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Prologis' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 12% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is PLD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PLD is currently mispriced by the market.Is Prologis Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Prologis has a high three-year median payout ratio of 51%. This means that it has only 49% of its income left to reinvest into its business. However, it's not unusual to see a REIT with such a high payout ratio mainly due to statutory requirements. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.Additionally, Prologis has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 58%. However, Prologis' future ROE is expected to decline to 6.6% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Prologis' performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

58,a7c1c932-e987-3f78-97f6-9d6f5ca3ebda,VRTX,2022-11-27,7 Stocks on the Perfect 10 List,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-perfect-10-list-234747208.html,1669247267,STORY,"['BNTX', 'MRNA', 'INMD', 'VRTX', 'SQM']","[A stock that scores a perfect 10 should be on every investor’s list of stocks to buy. Any company that receives full marks on quality, value, or growth are stocks I’d considering a perfect 10. For this article, I’m using StockRover’s stock screening tool, which screens for such qualities among a very large basket of companies.Despite many of these stocks to buy scoring so highly on one particular attribute, the market has heavily discounted most of these companies. Thus, it appears a tug-of-war between impatient investors and the Federal Reserve remains intact.That said, there’s a lot to like about most of the companies on this list. These stocks to buy tend to have strong profitability and balance sheets. Other companies that earned a strong growth score posted a strong five-year historical performance in this category. These companies also tend to have solid forward EBITDA estimates for both revenue and earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPerfect 10 stocks to buyBuy companies with StockRover scores in greenChart courtesy of StockRoverIn the table above, it’s clear that markets ignored drug manufacturers that posted strong profits from Covid vaccines. Investors should still earn steady profits, even if Covid becomes officially endemic in the next several years.Additionally, lithium producers also find themselves on this list. For those who believe demand for lithium will rise in the next decade, there are a number of juicy stocks to buy here.Let’s dive in.ALBAlbermarle$283.90BNTXBioNTech$156.23INMDInMode$36.15MRNAModerna$176.81SQMSociedad Química y Minera$99.38VRTXVertex Pharmaceuticals$316.16VISTVista Energy$13.27Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) scored a perfect growth score on StockRover. The specialty chemicals manufacturing firm posted strong third-quarter net sales, reporting growth of 152% year-over-year to $2.1 billion.One of the reasons for this growth score is the upside ALB stock provides investors from the global energy transition. Its lithium conversion plant in China and its Kemerton II expansion in Australia will bolster the company’s long-term growth prospects.Story continuesAlbermarle acquired the Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials in Quinzhou, China on Oct. 25 of this year. It’s expected the company will expand operations in the future. In addition, it has a project at Zhangjiagang. Since China is the largest lithium market in the world, Albermarle is strategically-positioned to supply the key input as demand grows.Albermarle benefits from the incredible growth of the electric vehicle segment. Demand remains strong, despite near-term supply chain challenges. Still, once the seasonall- slow period ends this quarter, the company expects strong growth through next year.EV investors should anticipate favorable government policies that strengthen the sector. As soon as the economy recovers, unit EV sales will rise, boosting ALB stock.BioNTech (BNTX)The headquarters of BioNTech (BNTX) in Germany.Source: Palatinate Stock / Shutterstock.comBioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) has a perfect quality stock grade, mainly due to attractive fundamentals. The vaccine maker reported positive clinical efficacy data against Omicron BA.4/BA.5. It said that its vaccine against that strain of Covid demonstrated an improved immune response. Additionally, the vaccine elicited a greater increase in neutralizing antibody titers than was anticipated.BioNTech investors may assume that demand for the bivalent booster will increase. The flu season is underway, meaning the target market for patients seeking better protection against Omicron will  result in a surge in requests for BioNTech’s vaccine.In the last quarter, BioNTech posted a stark revenue decline of 43% year-over-year. Indeed, vaccine demand is lower compared to last year. Still, the company established flexible contracts for 2023. It will continue to fulfill those contracts in 2023 and beyond. Thus as the vibrant constantly evolves, BioNTech will continue to provide updates about the vaccine’s efficacy.Governments everywhere could face the risk of a future variant evolving back to a deadlier disease. With the elderly especially at risk, I expect demand for the company’s vaccines will remain robust.The kicker with BNTX stock is that this company trades at a price-to-earnings ratio in the low single digits.InMode (INMD)image of a red laserSource: ShutterstockInMode (NASDAQ:INMD) makes laser and radiofrequency devices. Right now, I think the market is ignoring the perfect quality score for INMD stock.In the third quarter, InMode posted revenue growth of nearly 30%. The company expects earnings per share of up to $2.30, above analyst consensus estimates.Indeed, despite the economy approaching a recession last quarter, InMode’s business did not slow down. I expect momentum to continue as patient bookings using the company’s devices grow.InMode does not spend much on promoting its EmpowerRF product. To accelerate sales, the company will need to rely on doctors to recommend the treatment to their patients. Fortunately, InMode already has thousands of patients getting treatment. It has a disruptive product that has the potential to gain market share.InMode engaged with larger institutions to raise awareness of its research efforts. This might help interest groups put pressure on insurance firms to provide reimbursement, thus boosting this company’s growth further.Moderna (MRNA)The Moderna (MRNA) logo surrounded by syringes, pills and disposable face masks.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA), like BioNTech, relies primarily on Covid vaccine sales for its revenue. In 2023, it will realize around $2 billion to $3 billion in deferred revenue. The sales deferral is a result of a delay in Moderna’s fill-finish operations.Thus, I expect that in 2023, Moderna will report stronger revenue. As countries administer booster shots twice a year, I expect that the alignment of these shots with flu shots will boost demand. Over time, people will get used to taking a flu vaccine along with a Covid shot.Moderna has $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion in contracted sales, excluding U.S. deals. Since it’s expected Moderna will deliver its product to Japan and the European Union, investors face limited geographical risks. Investors should look out for hospitalization rates rising during the winter season. To circumvent the risk of full emergency rooms at hospitals, governments are likely to encourage Covid vaccinations, with Moderna’s shot being among the top choices for most healthcare providers.Moderna is also a company with a robust pipeline of products. The company is developing a personalized cancer vaccine. To succeed, it will need to offer treatment that is better than that of Merck’s (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda drug.Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM)Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipesSource: ShutterstockSociedad Quimica Y Minera (NYSE:SQM) is a Chilean chemical company. It supplies plant nutrients, lithium, industrial chemicals, and iodine.In the third quarter, SQM posted strong revenue as it earned $9.65 for the first nine months of 2022. This is sharply higher than the 92 cents of earnings per share reported in the same period last year. I think SQM will thrive as the demand for fertilizers remains strong. Still, as a cyclical firm, demand will fluctuate. Fortunately, farmers face tremendous pressure to obtain fertilizers to increase yields.In the current quarter, SQM will continue expanding its lithium carbonate capacity in Chile, obtaining permits to increase its capacity. In the next two or three years, shareholders will benefit from the increased output. Given the company’s long-term price contracts, investors stand to benefit from lower volatility in revenue and earnings.That said, spot prices for materials like hydrogen peroxide and lithium should rise in 2023. The market needs more supply, and demand is more likely to increase as the economy improves. That’s a nice setup for profitable growth for this agri supplier.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Various medical equipment is on top of a page with information about cystic fibrosis.Source: ShutterstockVertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is on what appears to be a sustained uptrend. StockRover assigned a perfect quality score on VRTX stock because of its bright future.I think Vertex is at a strategic inflection point. The company invested heavily in research and development, with will propel it to discover transformative medicines for serious diseases in specialty markets. As a small molecule company, Vertex has the tools to target specific diseases. For example, Trikafta is a cystic fibrosis drug that treats up to 90% of CF patients.The company is developing treatments for five additional disease areas. Investors do not need to wait long for this company to reach the market. That’s because many of these treatments are in late-stage development. For example, it will have drugs that treat sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.These drugs should impact the company’s fundamentals positively over the next year, making this stock a top pick on my list.Vista Energy (VIST)A close-up shot of pipelines with a setting sun in the background. Energy stocksSource: Kodda / Shutterstock.comVista Energy (NYSE:VIST) is another company that earned a perfect growth stock score. In the third quarter, the oil and gas firm posted revenue of $333.6 million, up more than 90% from last year.Vista finished with around 54,000 barrels of oil per day in production. It’s expected the company will grow its production volumes by 15% to 20% annually. By 2026, Vista expects production to reach 80,000 barrels daily, though internally, the company has higher targets. To do so, the company will rely on the development of Aguada Federal and Bajada del Palo Oeste.Vista is also expanding its infrastructure, including its OldelVal pipeline which is operating at full capacity. Still, there’s plenty of room for production increases to levels above what the market expects.Vista has strong cash flow growth. To maximize shareholder returns, it could allocate its $2.5 billion in cash flow by 2026 through a buyback program. That’s partly because of the company’s front-end infrastructure commitments. This will result in higher production, increasing cash flow, and enabling Vista to pay down its debt.

59,20135055-1b99-32fe-bef9-d565331617a7,NSC,2022-11-27,Returns Are Gaining Momentum At Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-gaining-momentum-norfolk-southern-110040925.html,1669546840,STORY,['NSC'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) so let's look a bit deeper.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Norfolk Southern, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$39b - US$2.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Norfolk Southern has an ROCE of 13%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 15% generated by the Transportation industry. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern roceIn the above chart we have measured Norfolk Southern's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Norfolk Southern here  for free.The Trend Of ROCENorfolk Southern is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 31% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo bring it all together, Norfolk Southern has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And a remarkable 101% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Norfolk Southern can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Norfolk Southern that you might find interesting.While Norfolk Southern may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

60,a3300868-0fe7-3e34-8de2-3e8d6b326a38,UNP,2022-11-27,"With 76% ownership of the shares, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/76-ownership-shares-union-pacific-140019304.html,1669471219,STORY,['UNP'],"[A look at the shareholders of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 76% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Union Pacific, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Union Pacific?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Union Pacific already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Union Pacific's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Union Pacific. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.6% and 4.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Union PacificWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Union Pacific Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$205m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Union Pacific. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Union Pacific has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Trading At A 33% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-140012424.html,1669471212,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Does the November share price for Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$14.6bUS$16.0bUS$15.7bUS$16.3bUS$16.9bUS$17.3bUS$17.6bUS$18.0bUS$18.3bUS$18.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.02%Est @ 2.01%Est @ 2%Est @ 1.99%Est @ 1.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$13.7kUS$14.0kUS$12.7kUS$12.3kUS$11.9kUS$11.4kUS$10.8kUS$10.3kUS$9.8kUS$9.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$116bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$19b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$363bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$363b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$181bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$297b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$48.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.024. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?
