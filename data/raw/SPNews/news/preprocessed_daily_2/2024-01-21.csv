Product diversification follows the same principle, but product control isn’t related to vertical integration. Product control exists in multiple forms, such as switching costs or happy customers who don’t want to buy elsewhere.

Adaptability also serves as a hedge against the unknown.', 'Consider our investment in Taiwan Semiconductor, which enjoys a highly adaptive product portfolio. If we compare TSMC to a fabless chip maker like\xa0QUALCOMM Incorporated\xa0(NASDAQ:QCOM), investing in Qualcomm is a bet that its products will retain their technological advantage over time. Meanwhile, TSMC sells a service that naturally produces whatever the end customer wants. There is little need for brilliant product-level foresight; TSMC just needs to maintain its process and service level advantages, allowing it to manufacture whatever the market demands. TSMC’s product portfolio is robust compared to most other semiconductor companies because it naturally adapts to technological and market-driven shifts. Instead of product-level risk, TSMC’s core risks are geopolitical.', 'In the past, I would have been more drawn to a company like Qualcomm given its clear technological lead in baseband modems, but if I’m honest with myself, I don’t know if their technologies will retain their dominance ten years from now. Qualcomm’s products express a relatively high degree of rigidity in a fast-changing industry, and this is something I prefer to avoid.', 'While robustness isn’t a guarantee of company survival, it acts as a natural buffer that insulates the companies we invest in against the unknown.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Nucor ', 'The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Nucor had US$6.84b in debt in September 2023; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$6.72b, its net debt is less, at about US$117.6m.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Nucor had liabilities of US$4.28b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$8.47b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$6.72b and US$3.43b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$2.61b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""Given Nucor has a humongous market capitalization of US$41.0b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Nucor has a very light debt load indeed."", ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Nucor has very little debt (net of cash), and boasts a debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.015 and EBIT of 245 times the interest expense. Indeed relative to its earnings its debt load seems light as a feather. In fact Nucor's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 43% in the last twelve months. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Nucor can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", 'Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Nucor recorded free cash flow worth 67% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""The good news is that Nucor's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But the stark truth is that we are concerned by its EBIT growth rate. All these things considered, it appears that Nucor can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that  Nucor is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable..."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

Signing a distribution agreement with PepsiCo in 2022, Celsius received a $550 million investment from the beverage juggernaut for 8.5% of its shares outstanding."", ""With access to Pepsi's massive distribution network, Celsius drinks were sold in many new channels it previously couldn't reach, like colleges, healthcare facilities, food service providers, hotels, casinos, and airports. These new verticals further boosted the company's incredible sales growth, helping it post a 104% increase in its most recent quarter."", ""In addition to revitalizing Celsius' growth story, this partnership with Pepsi appears to be streamlining the company's efforts toward sustained profitability. Since the transaction was closed in August of 2022, Celsius has seen its gross profit margin improve from 42% to 50%. It even had a net profit margin of 22% in its last quarter -- nearing the 24% margin of Monster, its largest publicly traded energy drink peer."", ""Pairing this newfound profitability with triple-digit growth rates, I'm more than happy to pay a premium and DCA into a small position in Celsius -- now the most-sold energy drink on Amazon."", 'Prepping over 1 million of the 16 million businesses in North America for work, Cintas provides uniform rentals, facility services (mats, mops, restroom supplies, and microfiber towels), first aid, safety devices, and fire protection services. While this may sound like a dull investment proposition, it perfectly encapsulates the power of the investing ""snap test.""', ""If I were to snap my fingers and all of Cintas' products disappeared overnight, it would wreak havoc (at least temporarily) on many businesses' ability to get any work done. While items like scrubs at hospitals, chef's uniforms, and fire extinguishers could be replaced by competitors with enough time, Cintas' customers would much rather not see this ever happening."", ""That's the beauty behind Cintas -- it does the ugly, behind-the-scenes work for businesses so they can focus on their actual operations."", 'And the good news for investors? Cintas does\xa0it in a highly profitable manner.', ""Growing its return on invested capital (ROIC) from 10% in 2014 to 22% today, the company's ability to generate net income from its debt and equity is top-tier and improving with time. Operating in a highly fragmented market, a high ROIC is a promising sign for Cintas, as it highlights an ability to make shrewd acquisitions and deploy new capital in under-penetrated geographies across North America."", ""These factors make Cintas a perfect DCA-and-hold-forever business, home to steady growth and a dividend that's increased for 40 straight years."", 'Home to a family of pest control brands, most notably the Orkin label, Rollins might be one of the most slept-on 100-baggers on the market -- reaching that milestone in just over 20 years.', ""Much like Cintas, Rollins leans on its masterful ability to generate increasing profits from its debt and equity, averaging an ROIC of 29% over the last decade. A strong ROIC like this should catch investors' attention as it has been proven that stocks with higher scores on this metric tend to outperform their lower-rank peers, as this article explains."", 'For Rollins specifically, a high ROIC is crucial to its long-term success due to its nature as a serial acquirer. Making numerous tuck-in acquisitions annually, Rollins has spent an average of 7% of its total sales on acquisitions over the last 10 years.', ""Generating a top-tier ROIC from this heavy spending on acquisitions highlights management's continued ability to make wise investments over time, helping to explain its jaw-dropping total returns in the 21st century.

This demonstrates that not only is the company willing and able to innovate, but it is doing so at an increasingly profitable rate.', 'With 86% of pet owners in a HABRI/Zoetis study stating they would pay whatever it takes to keep their pets healthy -- and the obvious necessity for livestock operations -- Zoetis is a perfect selection for my final stock to DCA into with time in 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Celsius wasn't one of them.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.', 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Flowserve (NYSE:FLS). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Flowserve ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Flowserve has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about."", ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Flowserve shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 4.9% to 9.7%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth."", ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart."", ""Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Flowserve's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting."", ""We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$5.3b company like Flowserve. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they hold US$27m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 0.5% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture."", ""You can't deny that Flowserve has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Flowserve's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for Flowserve  you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

This question is rarely posed anymore since data has overwhelmingly proved that investing in the stock markets is one of the best ways to increase your wealth over time. A report in October 2023 by the Wall Street Journal talked about the rise of ""mini-millionaires"" and how the average wealth of American families was increasing, citing data from the Federal Reserve. Mini-millionaires usually make about $150,000 and $250,000 a year. The report said between 2019 and 2022 families in the 80th to 90th percentile of the income distribution saw the biggest rise in their incomes as their median wealth increased by about 69% from 2019 through 2022, adjusted for inflation.', 'The report said that over 90% of these families reported owning stocks, either directly or indirectly.', ""Needless to say, investing in the stock market is full of crevices. You can't expect to get rich investing in low-quality stocks and random companies with no value. Investing in stocks to become rich involves patience, wise choices and sticking to traditional investing principles. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had in 2000 foreseen the changing trends in the stock market where investors were becoming impatient, expecting to make money without paying attention to the actual fundamentals of companies. But Klarman at the time had also predicted the return of traditional methods of evaluating companies before investing. In his letter to investors Klarman had said:"", '""If Paul Harvey\'s serialized radio program ""The Rest of the Story"" were applied to Wall Street, it would describe the sad denouement of many such ""story"" stocks. The unraveling of the virtuous circle of growth is not pretty, with earnings shortfalls, plunging share prices, employees with under-water options jumping ship, overzealous shareholders receiving margin calls, accounting chicanery exposed, lawsuits filed, and, to come full circle, the final insult of deletion from the relevant major market index. At this time, attractive valuation is not considered a good story. A slow growth or no growth company trading at one half or one third of its underlying value attracts no important constituency of investors. I sometimes joke about the new market valuation rules of thumb: stocks that fail to meet earnings expectations all seem to trade at 10 times reduced earnings, while formerly profitable companies that report losses all seem to trade at five dollars per share. Many investors avoid these stocks precisely because others are staying away. Why would those kind of stocks ever go up, they wonder. Even those of us with value investing in our DNA generally prefer situations with catalysts for the realization of underlying value.', 'Over time, this will change. At some unknowable future point, the undervaluation of small capitalization stocks lacking exciting growth characteristics will become so gaping that investors will once again be attracted. The point of investing, after all, is not to have a great story to tell; the point of investing is to make money with limited risk. At some point, investors will drop their Pulitzer prize winning story stocks and revisit their attention on the old classics, stocks that make you money because their undervaluation creates a compelling imbalance between risk and return.""', 'Seth Klarman of Baupost Group', 'Methodology', 'For this article we scoured various analyst reports and interviews to pick 11 stocks that experts believe can make one rich in the next 5-10 years.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 16', 'ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) is one of the stocks that can make one rich in the next few years according to Wall Street analysts.

Its market leadership and scale of operations give it an advantage over smaller players."", ""I think that its long-term growth prospects look great. Homeownership in the U.S. is rising despite a housing shortage and the median age of homes in the country is now over 40 years.

Its yield is much higher, for one thing. More importantly, the midstream energy provider isn't as vulnerable to oil and gas price fluctuations.

Enterprise Products Partners' cash flow per unit increased during the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 and declined only modestly during the oil price collapse of 2014-2017 and the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021."", ""It's easy to find stocks in the financial services sector with strong dividend growth.

The pharmacy and retail giant slashed its dividend by 48% to start this year, ending a streak of 47 straight years of increases. Before that reduction, the company had one of the highest dividend yields in the S&P 500 at around 7.5%. ', ""Walgreens' decision to throw in the towel on its long-standing dividend growth streak might make 3M (NYSE: MMM) investors nervous. The industrial giant also pays a big-time dividend (currently yielding 5.7%) that it has grown for more than 60 consecutive years. Here's a look at the likelihood that 3M's payout will face the same fate as Walgreens' dividend in 2024. "", ""Walgreens' financial situation has deteriorated in recent years. During its last fiscal year, the company's earnings per share declined more than 20%. Meanwhile, its operational cash flow slumped by over $1.6 billion to less than $2.3 billion. That left it with only $665 million in free cash flow after funding its capital spending ($1.5 billion less than the prior fiscal year). "", ""The company's free cash flow was about $1 billion short of its total dividend outlay for the year (nearly $1.7 billion). While Walgreens was able to cover that shortfall by selling assets, including nearly $1.8 billion of real estate through sale-leaseback transactions, its issues put pressure on its balance sheet. Credit rating agency Moody's cut Walgreens' credit rating to a noninvestment or junk bond level in December. S&P Global also cut its rating on Walgreens last year to the last level before junk. "", ""Walgreens' financial issues led the company to take additional action to shore up its cash flow and balance sheet in 2024 by slashing its dividend. The move will save the company $800 million annually, which it can use to fund growth capital investments and repay debt. The company also plans to reduce capital expenses by around $600 million while targeting about $1 billion in operational cost savings to further improve its financial situation. "", '3M\'s high-yielding payout suggests it\'s also at risk of a reduction. The main factor causing concern is the company\'s legal issues. It has been working to settle litigation claims brought against the company regarding earplugs sold to the military and ""forever chemicals"" that the EPA has designated as hazardous. ', 'The company reached settlements in both cases last year. It agreed to pay up to $6 billion to settle the Combat Arms earplugs litigation and $10.3 billion for claims relating to the forever chemicals. It will pay these settlements over many years. ', ""On the one hand, the settlements provided clarity on its future liabilities. However, credit rating agencies deemed them to be negative. S&P Global cut its rating on 3M's credit to BBB+, three levels above junk, while Moody's maintained its A2 rating with a negative outlook on its credit. "", ""Meanwhile, 3M's financial results have started improving over the past year. Its adjusted free cash flow was up 37% to $4.3 billion through the third quarter of last year. That was enough to cover its $2.5 billion in dividend payments, with room to spare. 3M used that excess cash to strengthen its balance sheet. Net debt has declined by 11% over the past year to $10.8 billion. "", ""These factors all seem to suggest that 3M should be able to maintain its dividend, if not continue to increase the payout. However, that doesn't mean the dividend is safe. A potential catalyst for a cut is the company's upcoming spinoff of its healthcare unit as an independent public company. "", ""On the one hand, 3M expects to receive a $1 billion cash dividend from that entity following the spinoff to help cover its legal settlements. However, the unit generated $8.4 billion in annual sales in 2022 (about a quarter of its total). Because it's such a meaningful contributor, 3M may opt to reset its dividend following the spinoff to reflect its reduced earnings profile and retain more cash to fund its legal liabilities. "", ""On balance, 3M is in a better financial position than Walgreens. It generates more than enough free cash flow to cover its dividend and has a higher credit rating. However, given the company's legal liabilities and upcoming spinoff, its dividend could still face the same fate. Because of that, income investors need to prepare themselves for a potential cut, which could come this year following the spinoff of its healthcare unit."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in 3M right now?', 'Before you buy stock in 3M, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and 3M wasn't one of them.

But Dutch Bros shares have largely languished since then despite strong growth from its underlying business.', ""If you're considering whether Dutch Bros stock might be worthy of a spot in your portfolio, here are three things you'll want to know."", 'Like any good coffee chain, Dutch Bros knows the value of a good rewards program to foster loyalty and drive repeat sales. Its number of rewards member registrations climbed by 1.65 million people in the first three quarters of 2023, bringing its total to nearly 5 million members and accounting for 63% of all transactions in its latest quarter.', 'By comparison, global coffee chain behemoth Starbucks saw its own Starbucks Rewards membership base grow by 14% year over year last quarter to 32.6 million people, representing around 57% of total U.S. sales.', 'But Dutch Bros\' management also realizes that a good rewards program can serve to solidify its presence in new locations as well. Among several ""business-building initiatives"" laid out in its most recent quarterly call, Dutch Bros CFO Charley Jemley said the company intends to ""aggressively [use] our rewards program to attract new customers and retain existing ones with a particular focus on building engagement in newer markets.""', 'Dutch Bros has already achieved a stunning increase in its number of locations in recent years, more than doubling its shops from 370 in fiscal 2019 to 831 in 2023. But Dutch Bros also expects to more than quadruple its current base from here, to 4,000 shops over the longer term.', ""If that sounds overly ambitious, keep in mind Starbucks already boasts over 16,000 locations in the U.S. alone. It's also no coincidence that to guide the company through this next phase of growth, Dutch Bros recently brought in former Starbucks executive Christine Barone to take over as CEO in the place of company founder Joth Ricci, effective Jan. 1."", 'Considering Dutch Bros issued fresh guidance last week for total system shop openings in 2024 in the range of 150 to 165, that should leave the company with an enviable runway for growth that will last years as it introduces its obviously scalable concept to the masses.', 'In addition to bringing in Barrone as CEO starting this year, Dutch Bros also astutely shifted its growth strategy last year to more effectively expand its geographic footprint amid elevated buildout costs.', 'Previously, the company\'s real estate strategy revolved around a ""fortressing"" approach, where it would enter a market and stockpile multiple stores in the area to build brand awareness and shorten drive-thru times -- even if it meant shifting some sales from existing locations to newer ones.', 'Dutch Bros will, however, begin to pursue a ""wider"" vs. ""deeper"" approach, with a greater mix of newer markets and slower infill rates within those markets. Rather than focusing on sites that enabled ground leases as it had before, a strategy that stemmed in part from supply chain and construction pressures in recent years, Dutch Bros now has the luxury of pursuing a more diverse range of leases and shop formats. These will include both larger stand-alone locations with lobbies, and smaller end-cap locations that more closely echo Starbucks\' historical permeation strategy.', ""In all, it's clear that Dutch Bros is holding steady in the near term. If the company is able to balance its heady growth ambitions with steadily improving operational efficiency at scale, I see no reason its stock price won't eventually follow suit."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dutch Bros wasn't one of them.

Whether or not you drink their coffee or eat their pastries, chances are that you walk or drive past several Starbucks locations each day."", ""And while Starbucks might be the most recognized brand in craft coffee, consumers have no shortage of options. Major chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's also sell coffee, and city blocks are often packed with smaller chains or boutique cafes."", ""One budding player looking to take on legacy coffee brewers is Oregon-based Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS). You wouldn't be the first if you've never heard of them. But make no mistake, Dutch Bros is growing rapidly and I think it has a shot at disrupting the coffee industry."", ""Let's dig into the business and explore why the stock might be a good opportunity."", ""Let's face it -- coffee is a relatively commoditized product. While there are many different types of beans or flavors, it's a pretty simple drink."", 'One of the biggest differentiators among coffee brewers is the menu. Seasonal drinks such as the pumpkin spiced latte or a winter-holiday themed mocha are a common way coffee houses entice people to come in and make a purchase.', 'But like other forms of retail, one of the biggest contributing factors to customer loyalty is service quality. Dutch Bros has fostered a unique culture that centers around quick and friendly service. The company\'s ""broistas"" are held to a high standard of not only preparing drinks efficiently, but ensuring the customer experience is top-notch.', ""Let's take a look at the company's financial and operating picture and assess how this approach is paying off."", 'The table below illustrates some important metrics for Dutch Bros as of the third quarter, ended Sept. 30.', 'Metric', 'Q3 2022', 'Q3 2023', 'Change', 'Revenue', '$199 million', '$265 million', '33%', 'Locations', '641', '794', '24%', 'Same-store sales growth', '1.7%', '4%', 'N/A', 'Data Source: Company Investor Presentation', ""One of the challenges that the retail industry has faced over the last couple of years is a tough labor environment. Rising costs have impacted margins and profitability, thereby stifling a business's opportunity to grow."", ""Yet despite these challenges, Dutch Bros has been able to accelerate its top line through a combination of opening new locations and increasing its same-store sales. Not only does this underscore the company's brand loyalty, but it also is a testament to management's ability to navigate a cloudy macroeconomic environment."", ""According to management's latest guidance, Dutch Bros is expected to achieve between $150 million and $155 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for 2023. This would represent nearly 68% growth year over year at the midpoint."", 'The chart above illustrates the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of Dutch Bros benchmarked against a cohort of competing coffee and fast-casual restaurant chains. At a P/S multiple of just 1.8, Dutch Bros is the lowest-valued stock by this metric among the competition.', 'There are likely a couple of factors at play here. First, the food and beverage industry is not exactly affiliated with monster growth. While companies such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and many others have evolved into worldwide industry leaders over many decades, growth investors may be captivated by other sectors.', 'Additionally, while Dutch Bros has demonstrated its ability to operate a growing and nimble business, investors need to be realistic about its long-term potential. As it stands today, Dutch Bros primarily operates throughout the Midwest and along the West Coast. The company has a stated mission of opening 4,000 shops in the long run. By comparison, Starbucks has over 38,000 stores in 80 different countries.', ""Lastly, coffee is one of those lifestyle categories that can be difficult to assess when it comes to investing. What I mean by that is even if Dutch Bros achieves its expansion goals, the company is likely going to need to ratchet up its marketing efforts in order to acquire a critical mass. Consumers often develop habits, making it both challenging and risky to try to change their behaviors. This can make the company's long-term potential appear questionable."", ""I wouldn't invest in Dutch Bros based off a hunch that the company can dethrone Starbucks or any other major coffee roaster. Instead, a thorough analysis of the business and its growth is a more useful tool."", 'While the company is still small compared to the competition, Dutch Bros is showing clear signs of robust operating leverage and business efficiency. As the company expands and opens up more locations, Dutch Bros could very well enjoy long-term sustained sales and profit growth.', 'For these reasons, investors may want to consider a position in the stock as it trades at a discount relative to its peers. However, keeping a keen eye on the long-term performance should help make it more clear over time whether or not Dutch Bros deserves to be a more prominent fixture in your portfolio.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dutch Bros wasn't one of them.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) stock is up an impressive 200% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 28% in about a quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 14% in the last three months.', ""So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group ', 'While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""Over half a decade, TransDigm Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 6.9% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 25% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 46.41."", ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", 'We know that TransDigm Group has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.', ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of TransDigm Group, it has a TSR of 259% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""It's nice to see that TransDigm Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 63% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 29% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand TransDigm Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for TransDigm Group (2 are a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The dividend yield will be 3.7% based on this payment which is still above the industry average."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Northern Trust ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained."", ""Northern Trust has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but Northern Trust's payout ratio of 59% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends."", 'Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 47.7%. The future payout ratio could be 45% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.', 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.24, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.2% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.', ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Northern Trust has seen earnings per share falling at 5.1% per year over the last five years. A modest decline in earnings isn't great, and it makes it quite unlikely that the dividend will grow in the future unless that trend can be reversed. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited."", ""Overall, we think Northern Trust is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. With shrinking earnings, the company may see some issues maintaining the dividend even though they look pretty sustainable for now. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again."", 'Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from competition or inflation. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

That includes your stock portfolio.', ""There are many reasons why you may feel unhappy with your portfolio. Maybe you've underperformed the market in recent years or aren't on track to hit your financial goals. Or maybe you feel like you're taking on risk and not getting the reward you expected."", ""Whatever the cause of the frustration, there are a few simple and easy changes you can make in 2024 to improve your sentiment. After all, we can't control the whims of the stock market or wish a stock to go higher, but we can choose what to invest in and set checks and balances to prevent an emotional and financially painful decision. Here are three investing changes to consider in 2024."", 'It\'s easy to feel uneasy in the market if your risk tolerance and portfolio are misaligned. For example, you might look at the Nasdaq Composite\'s 43.4% return in 2023 or the outperformance by all the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks and feel like you missed out. But zoom out just a little, and you\'ll find that the Nasdaq lost 33.1% in 2022, and all of the Magnificent Seven stocks had terrible years.', 'Some of the greatest gains in the stock market follow painful losses. It takes a lot of patience and a long-term time horizon to hold through periods of volatility, and even more discipline not to sell the second a position begins to recover. In the stock market, just as with everything in life, knowing your tendencies is important. To quote the famous line from Shakespeare\'s Hamlet: ""To thine own self be true.""', ""If you're more risk-averse, there are ways to achieve excellent returns over time by picking safe stocks, focusing on stable income-generating businesses, and having an ultra-diverse portfolio. You may not keep pace with a surging bull market, but you'll also stand a better chance at avoiding the worst of a steep sell-off."", ""Or maybe you're more risk-tolerant and feel your portfolio is too conservative. The worst thing to do in that instance is to chase high-flying expensive stocks just because you think they'll go higher, without knowing anything about the companies in the first place."", 'The key takeaway is that nothing in the stock market is free. Investors who were highly concentrated in growth stocks suffered brutal losses in 2022. Those who were able to stomach the volatility were rewarded in 2023. But no one knows what will happen this year. The ride could continue, or a major correction could happen in big tech.', ""This leads us to our next point: Only invest in companies you understand well. If you're unhappy with your stock portfolio, chances are it's because you're wondering why other stocks are going up and the ones you are invested in aren't, or stocks you own are going down and you're losing money."", ""Again, anything can happen in the short term. Sometimes, stocks go down or up for the wrong reasons. But beyond that, it's important to keep tabs on what's happening in the broader market and the industries you're investing in, and then drill down to the specific company."", ""Companies in the same industry tend to be quite correlated. If you own a lot of discretionary retail stocks and consumer spending is under pressure, those companies will share the same challenges. Similarly, if you're investing in a growth industry like renewable energy, and interest rates are high, then there will be a higher cost of investment capital across the industry."", ""More important than the industry is the company itself. Just because you pick a stock in a hot industry doesn't mean it will be a winner. There are factors to consider, like valuation, the company's financial health, products and services, innovation, culture, leadership, growth plans, trajectory, and more."", ""It's frustrating to look at a stock in your portfolio and wonder why you own it in the first place. To prevent that, only buy shares in companies you know well."", ""Before you buy a stock, it's helpful to take some time to write down a few things (you can do the same exercise with an existing position):"", 'Explain why you invested in a company in the first place.', 'Define what your investment thesis is for the stock.', 'Outline what you expect from the company in the next year, three years, and five years.', 'Answer what would have to happen for you to want to exit the position.', 'List reasons why you may consider investing more in the company.', 'Make note of any other useful ideas that can help make a future decision easier.', ""It sounds old-fashioned, but I find it helpful to jot these notes down in a journal and then review them when I'm looking for reassurance in my decisions. The idea is to limit the randomness of emotional decision-making so that I can act rationally when the market is irrational."", ""Having a clear idea of a company's long-term investment thesis and measurable ways to ensure it remains on track to meet that investment thesis is vital to being a successful long-term investor."", ""This task is harder when dealing with a smaller, unproven company. If we go back and think about\xa0 Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) in its early years as a public company, for example, the company struggled to stay profitable as management focused instead on subscriber growth and massive content spending. Before that, Netflix's home delivery DVD plan competed directly with brick-and-mortar video stores. It took a long time for Netflix to build a powerful digital content library to transition purely to streaming. Even then, customers remained skeptical about the long-term viability of streaming and whether content creators would build their own services and take their shows and movies off Netflix."", ""The solution, as we know now, was for Netflix to produce its own content. There have been snags along the way and criticism for overspending on quantity rather than quality. But through it all, nothing changed about Netflix's long-term investment thesis. It faced different challenges and had to evolve with the needs of customers. But it never gave investors a glaring reason to bail on the stock."", ""The Netflix investment thesis was, and continues to be, centered around easily accessible entertainment. The means of distributing that entertainment and the content itself have changed. But that's expected and encouraged. Truly understanding the Netflix investment thesis would have made the stock easier to hold over the last 20 years. Maybe you sold a chunk here and there. But even a small position would have led to unbelievable gains."", ""In the stock market, it's easy to spin the narrative of a good stock versus a bad stock, or a hot industry versus a cold one. But in reality, it's much more important to look at a longer timeline, which smooths out randomness. An even bigger factor to consider is position sizing and portfolio allocation."", ""Returning to the Magnificent Seven stocks example, the headline news that mega-cap tech crushed the market in 2023 is true. But it's impossible to assume that someone bought a stock at the end of 2022 at the perfect time and held it all of last year. For example, Tesla may have doubled in 2023.

Joke’s on him, though, because everyone else seems to.', 'Up-to-date info isn’t available, but it’s now known that investors have poured at least $1.9 billion into the new crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds in their first three days of trading. The most bullish estimates expect up to $100 billion flowing into bitcoin funds by the end of the year.', 'This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.', 'That’s a lot of pent-up demand, beating the last record inflows of $1.2 billion within three days in 2021 … which also went into a bitcoin-based product, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (which tracked bitcoin futures rather than its spot price), Reuters reported.', 'See also: Bitcoin Instantly Topped Silver in ETF Market and Trails Only Gold Among Commodities', 'A number of marquee financial firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton lined up to launch bitcoin ETFs, and are now also considering ether [ETH] funds. And yet, Sommer seems ready to write all of this off.', '""FOMO is the main reason for putting money into Bitcoin, which remains highly speculative, difficult to categorize and without an immediately identifiable economic function,” the NYT columnist wrote in his latest edition of the “Strategies” newsletter, referencing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) anti-FOMO bulletin.', 'FOMO, aka the fear of missing out, is certainly a part of crypto investing. For instance, it’s the main driver behind degens chasing the highs of meme coins like BONK or dogwifhat, which truly serve little economic function beyond speculation.', 'But to write off bitcoin simply as a turn of the roulette wheel with $800 billion on the table is to willingly mislead oneself. You don’t have to personally believe what bitcoiners believe to take their arguments seriously, for fear of mockery or ostracization (FOMOO) by your crypto-skeptic peers, Jeff.', 'To be fair, Sommer did tip his hat to the technology behind Bitcoin, i.e. b l o c k c h a i n, to hedge his own argument. To wit:', '“Bitcoin is a serious proposition, in terms of its underlying structure. The use of blockchain, the decentralized, peer-to-peer structure and the complex mathematical code demand respect. Concepts embedded in Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies could have real-world importance at some point…”', 'This was not Sommer’s only completely original and novel thought, he also steadfastly argued that cryptocurrency is a “misnomer” because cryptocurrencies, despite maybe one day having “real-world” utility somewhere, are not really “currencies.” And, he said, the comparison between bitcoin and gold is off because gold has historical “cache.”', ""As the great and powerful Satoshi Nakamoto once said, “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.” At this point it’s not even worth addressing these extremely tired arguments, which seem to be carried out by seasoned journalists everytime crypto notches some victory."", 'But considering that they’re brand new, I’ll try to do Sommer a solid and get him up-to-date on why interest in bitcoin ETFs is more than FOMO.', 'First, there is Bitcoin’s philosophical proposition — the idea that there ought to be a global, stateless monetary network available to all. Often called a libertarian wet-dream, the Bitcoin vision is so simple it actually slots neatly into a range of political philosophies — from globalizing neoconservatism to historical Marxism, just not anything truly authoritarian.', 'Again, you don’t have to buy into the rising trend towards populism to take an interest in it. Many people are feeling with the spread of corporate and governmental surveillance; rising economic inequality; and other geopolitical issues that something like Bitcoin, which empowers everyone without asking for anything of any particular user in return, is a powerful symbol at the very least.', 'Second, there is the fact that bitcoin is one of the most successful economic investments on record. It may not be the best performing asset every year, and certainly many people have lost money trading it, but there is no denying bitcoin’s meteoric gains over the past decade and a half.', 'See also: Bitcoin ETF Net Inflows Near $1B After Three Days', 'This is where the idea of “hodling” comes in, which recommends people buy and hold bitcoin over a long time horizon, because even if the always-volatile bitcoin dips, those are only paper-losses until you sell. Bitcoin ETFs help a larger swath of retail and institutional buyers access BTC, typically through vehicles like retirement accounts or corporate treasuries that will likely hodl for years if not decades.', 'True, bitcoin is not guaranteed to rise in price and could even drop to $0. And true, as Sommer points out, there are other ways to gain exposure to crypto via traditional routes, like buying other indexes that invest in crypto-related stocks, like Coinbase, MicroStrategy or the many publicly listed mining companies.', 'Simply put, there is something powerful to the idea of actually owning an asset that cannot be seized. Spot bitcoin ETFs are a poor approximation of that since buyers of the ETFs never actually get their hands on bitcoin.', 'But Sommer is shutting himself off to that idea early, and trying to convince his readers that the massive interest in bitcoin that was just demonstrably proven via the launch of 11 bitcoin ETFs this month is all just FOMO. The sad thing is, the argument works just as well in reverse: Even if demand for bitcoin is just a matter of social contagion, then so is skepticism, because you need to hear about something to turn away from it.

A broader gauge of Latin American equities rose 0.8% but was set for a weekly loss of 3.4% - the steepest since early October.

According to defense analysts, battle tanks continue to be an important military equipment, especially when they are used in synchronicity with other weapons.', 'Tanks are armed with powerful weapons that offer strong protection from dangers on the battlefield, and their presence alone intimidates any enemy in front of them. They do, however, have limitations, being easy targets for improvised explosive devices (IEDs), drones, anti-tank missiles, and artillery. To counter these threats, modern tanks come equipped with sensors and technologies to detect hazards in order to tackle them.', 'The M1 Abrams, developed by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), are the main battle tanks used by the United States. These include advanced electronics, improved self-defense systems, and powerful weapons. These third-generation tanks are also known for their thick armor that enables them to withstand explosive rounds and even chemical and nuclear conditions, apart from enemy fire. Moreover, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) separated the fuel and ammunition compartments in the M1 Abrams, which further enhanced the tank’s superior protection.', 'M1 Abrams are among the most advanced battle tanks in the world today. The US in January 2023 announced to provide Ukraine 31 of these tanks worth $400 million to assist Kyiv in its defense against Russian invasion. Later in October that year, officials of the US military confirmed to VOA News that all promised tanks had been delivered to Ukraine.', 'Germany’s Leopard 2A7+ (Leo2A7+) is another highly promising modern battle tank that is capable of undertaking both low and high intensity military operations. It is an improved version of the Leopard 2, having a dual-kit on the turret, whereas its frontal protection is enhanced by the introduction of a hull front. The Leo2A7+ offers 360 degree protection against landmines and rocket-propelled grenades. Other modern battle tanks that are much talked-about for their sophistication and capabilities like the M1 Abrams and Leo2A7+ are Russia’s T-14 ARMATA and Israel’s Merkava battle tanks.', ""Militaries are also rapidly integrating combat vehicle protection systems to keep tanks safe from battlefield threats. In 2021, the American army selected Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to provide base-kits for testing on Abrams, Bradley and Stryker vehicles. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s Modular Active Protection System base kit integrates vehicle sensors that detect and defeat anti-tank guided missiles and rocket-propelled grenades."", 'In July 2023, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) received a $117.5 million contract from the US Army, under which it is to provide 3rd Generation Forward Looking Infrared B-Kit sensors for the Abrams battle tanks. These advanced sensors that will be developed by RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) are expected to enhance lethality and survival prospects of manned fighting vehicles to provide a critical edge to the US military on the battlefield against its adversaries. According to RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), these advanced sensors would provide high resolution images that would aid in target detection and identification. The company has delivered more than 25,000 second-generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensors to the US military over the last 20 years.', 'Photo by Kevin Schmid on Unsplash', ""Countries with the most battle tanks in the world are listed in ascending order of the size of their tank fleet.

According to the BBC, Kyiv has received dozens of tanks from its European allies and the United States. These include 31 Abrams tanks from the United States, 14 Challenger 2 tanks received from the United Kingdom, 14 Leopard 2 tanks from Germany, and 6 Leopard 2 tanks provided by Spain.', 'Tanks: 1,996', 'Iran has a sizable fleet of battle tanks with 1,996 tanks according to the Global Firepower Index 2024. Karrar, which is a version of Iran’s T-72S tanks, is the most notable tank that Tehran operates.

These include about 300 PT-76 and PT-76B tanks, along with 150 Chinese Type 63 tanks.

These tanks come with 120 mm L/55 smoothbore guns, and can carry 40 120 mm rounds, according to a report by Janes. Moreover, the Altay tanks have a new protection system, improved armor, and vehicle-control system.\xa0', 'Tanks: 2,501', 'South Korea’s military is equipped with some of the most advanced and sophisticated battle tanks in the world. The K2 Black Panther, a locally-developed Korean tank manufactured by Hyundai Rotem is often compared to General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)’s Abrams tanks in terms of the protection it offers. The tank comes with a CN08 120 mm, 55 caliber smoothbore gun, and its armor is able to withstand direct hits from close range. Several countries have shown interest in procuring these tanks from South Korea, and still continue to do so.

The army also operates about 50 T-54 and 400 Type-69 II battle tanks – the latter being based on Chinese designs, but license-built in Pakistan. Islamabad and Beijing also co-developed the Al-Khalid battle tanks. Pakistan currently has 350 of these, and according to a report in The Diplomat, both countries are working to develop a more advanced version of these tanks which will be called Al-Khalid III. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its 2022 report stated that Pakistan had entered into a contract with China to purchase 679 VT4, which will be license-built in Pakistan under the name of Haider. The monetary terms of the contract are not known.', 'Tanks: 4,614', 'Given the strength and size of India’s ground forces, it is no surprise that it finds itself among countries with the most battle tanks in the world.

Product diversification follows the same principle, but product control isn’t related to vertical integration. Product control exists in multiple forms, such as switching costs or happy customers who don’t want to buy elsewhere. However, one often overlooked dimension of product-level robustness is adaptability. Some businesses offer goods and services that behave like shapeshifters; they naturally adapt to the market’s needs regardless of how the world changes. Adaptability also serves as a hedge against the unknown.', 'Consider our investment in Taiwan Semiconductor, which enjoys a highly adaptive product portfolio. If we compare TSMC to a fabless chip maker like\xa0QUALCOMM Incorporated\xa0(NASDAQ:QCOM), investing in Qualcomm is a bet that its products will retain their technological advantage over time. Meanwhile, TSMC sells a service that naturally produces whatever the end customer wants. There is little need for brilliant product-level foresight; TSMC just needs to maintain its process and service level advantages, allowing it to manufacture whatever the market demands. TSMC’s product portfolio is robust compared to most other semiconductor companies because it naturally adapts to technological and market-driven shifts. Instead of product-level risk, TSMC’s core risks are geopolitical.', 'In the past, I would have been more drawn to a company like Qualcomm given its clear technological lead in baseband modems, but if I’m honest with myself, I don’t know if their technologies will retain their dominance ten years from now. Qualcomm’s products express a relatively high degree of rigidity in a fast-changing industry, and this is something I prefer to avoid.', 'While robustness isn’t a guarantee of company survival, it acts as a natural buffer that insulates the companies we invest in against the unknown.

Its market leadership and scale of operations give it an advantage over smaller players."", ""I think that its long-term growth prospects look great. Homeownership in the U.S. is rising despite a housing shortage and the median age of homes in the country is now over 40 years. These factors bode well for the home improvement industry -- and for Lowe's, in particular."", ""You could argue that the dividend growth for the energy stocks I've included on the list isn't that great.

My view is that the attractive dividends offered by the two companies will keep getting better and better for investors who buy and hold.', ""Enterprise Products Partners could be the better choice for income investors. Its yield is much higher, for one thing. More importantly, the midstream energy provider isn't as vulnerable to oil and gas price fluctuations. Enterprise generates solid cash flow from its 50,000-plus miles of pipeline regardless of what commodity prices are."", ""This stability shows up in the company's track record. Enterprise Products Partners' cash flow per unit increased during the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 and declined only modestly during the oil price collapse of 2014-2017 and the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021."", ""It's easy to find stocks in the financial services sector with strong dividend growth.

That's on the low end of the bank's historical valuation range."", ""Another reason why Bank of America is a great stock to buy and hold for the long term, in my view, is the company's continual innovation. It's not surprising to me at all that BofA was named the best consumer digital bank in the U.S. and the most innovative bank in North America last year."", ""If that's not compelling enough, perhaps Warren Buffett's backing for BofA will be.

However, the drugmaker's dividend is growing by leaps and bounds, a trend that I expect will continue well into the future."", ""More important than its dividend, though, are Lilly's overall growth prospects.

The catalyst to this line of thinking came with Google's (as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was known at the time) decision to team up with Fidelity to invest $1 billion in Elon Musk's pioneering space company, giving SpaceX a private market valuation of $10 billion at the time."", ""Eight years later, SpaceX's value has gone up 18-fold."", 'Reuters reported this surprising number last month, citing a SpaceX plan to allow its employees to sell some of their private shares at $97 apiece, resulting in an immediate 20% jump in valuation on the space stock, from $150 billion (in early December) to $180 billion (at the end of the month).', ""Viewed in isolation, the fact that SpaceX is currently the world's biggest space company, and easily its most prolific launcher of rockets, makes that $180 billion valuation seem not totally crazy. But have you noticed that United Launch Alliance (ULA) -- the joint venture between Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) that is still considered SpaceX's biggest rival in space launch -- is being valued at much, much less than $180 billion?"", ""How much less, you ask? Well personally, I've ballparked United Launch Alliance's value (in an auction that's currently ongoing) at about $5.2 billion. But in an article that came out late last month, The Wall Street Journal quoted investment banker Jefferies & Co. citing a much smaller number -- $3 billion, or even perhaps as little as $2 billion -- as the likely price when the bidding for ULA comes to an end."", 'And it got me thinking: If Jefferies is right in its calculations, why is it that ULA would be worth so much less than its closest rival SpaceX?', ""This question isn't as easy to answer as it perhaps should be, for two reasons: First, SpaceX is a private company, and so it doesn't (and doesn't have to) give regular and accurate data on its revenue, profits, or free cash flow. And second, despite Boeing and Lockheed being public companies, it's not 100% clear how profitable their ULA subsidiary is."", ""We're not totally in the dark. Lockheed Martin does break out some financial data on its own space business, which includes at least some numbers from ULA. We know from data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, for example, that Lockheed's space revenue has grown about 29% over the past five years (so about 5% per year) from $10 billion to $12.9 billion. At the same time, we know that Lockheed's operating profit in space -- $1.06 billion in 2018 -- was only $1.05 billion over the last 12 months."", ""So Lockheed Martin's space business has actually been getting less profitable over time, and its profit margins have been shrinking as it's been forced to compete with SpaceX. We can't know, but we can presume, the same is true for Boeing's space business as well, and for the ULA joint venture as a whole."", ""Now, admittedly, ULA just launched its new Vulcan Centaur rocket for the first time. At a price just half what it used to need to charge for its Atlas V launches, there's a chance ULA will be able to reverse these trends and grow faster and more profitably in the future."", ""Still, compare the numbers ULA is putting up today to SpaceX's. According to CNBC, SpaceX probably did about $2 billion in sales in 2018. But through 2023, it grew that revenue 450% to an estimated $9 billion. Compounded annually, that's a growth rate of 35% per year -- seven times as fast as ULA."", ""On profits, SpaceX may have earned at least a small profit in 2018. (We can't be sure, but according to internal company documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, that was the plan.) And in 2023 the company seems to have reached steady profitability, with our best guess being it earned about $220 million last year."", ""So in short, SpaceX is growing much faster than ULA, and it's getting more profitable over time -- while ULA is getting less profitable. These seem to me two big reasons why private investors might value SpaceX more than they value ULA."", 'On top of all that, SpaceX owns its own satellite internet business, Starlink, a business that SpaceX expects to churn out as much as 60% operating profit margins on its sales once it gets up to speed. And SpaceX has a new rocketship, the Starship, with which it hopes to drive the cost of space launch down to $10 million or less -- underpricing every other rocket company on the planet.', 'All things considered, I believe investors have good reason to value SpaceX more highly than ULA.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lockheed Martin wasn't one of them.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Johnson & Johnson's  ROE today."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Johnson & Johnson is:', '20% = US$14b ÷ US$71b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To start with, Johnson & Johnson's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 11%. Probably as a result of this, Johnson & Johnson was able to see a decent growth of 5.8% over the last five years."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Johnson & Johnson's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 8.5% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is JNJ fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Johnson & Johnson has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 65%, meaning that it is left with only 35% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.', ""Moreover, Johnson & Johnson is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 47% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 32% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio."", ""Overall, we feel that Johnson & Johnson certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely due to the company reinvesting its earnings at a pretty high rate of return. However, given the high ROE, we do think that the company is reinvesting a small portion of its profits. This could likely be preventing the company from growing to its full extent. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Therefore, a $10,000 investment in PayPal on its first trading day would have briefly grown to more than $74,000 before shrinking back to about $14,000 today.

PayPal's initial growth supported that bullish view."", ""From 2015 to 2022, PayPal's annual revenue grew from $9.2 billion to $27.5 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17%.

First, eBay replaced PayPal with smaller Dutch rival Adyen as its preferred payment platform in a three-year transition from 2018 to 2021. Second, aggressive competitors like Block's Square and Cash App, Apple Pay, and Alphabet's Google Pay crept into its backyard. Lastly, inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds broadly curbed consumer spending throughout 2022 and most of 2023."", ""PayPal's revenue rose 8% year over year in the first nine months of 2023 as those headwinds persisted, and its total number of active accounts dipped 1% to 428 million at the end of the third quarter.

The company also aims to provide more mobile and web payment services through its Braintree subsidiary, and believes it can leverage accumulated customer data to help its merchants create more personalized shopping experiences."", ""But over the long term, it's still unclear if PayPal has room to grow in an increasingly crowded market. Apple and Google enable customers to make purchases directly through their first-party services, e-commerce companies like Shopify are expanding their own integrated payment platforms, and Adyen is gaining ground with its backend payments software -- which is more flexible and customizable and less restrictive than PayPal's Braintree platform."", ""PayPal's gradual loss of active accounts suggests the company lacks a meaningful moat against those existential threats, and could be forced to gradually raise fees or launch intrusive new features to squeeze more revenue from its current customers and merchants. However, those strategies could backfire and make PayPal less attractive."", 'On the bright side, PayPal has been aggressively cutting costs and buying back shares to boost its earnings per share (EPS).

According to Markets and Markets, the global digital payment market could grow at a CAGR of 12% from 2023 to 2028 -- which is a decent growth rate, but well below the threshold for generating millionaire-making gains."", ""PayPal's downside might be limited at these prices, but investors shouldn't expect the company to become a great growth stock unless it disrupts the digital payments industry again."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

Stocks seen as direct plays on the AI trend have skyrocketed, especially if they have an early lead in some subsector of the AI revolution."", 'For instance, shares of AI-chip pioneer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have more than tripled in 52 weeks. AI-based cybersecurity expert CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD) soared 177% higher over the same period. Data analytics specialist Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) made a 134% jump, also driven by its AI-powered products and services.', ""These AI-focused market darlings float on incredibly rich valuation ratios. The price-to-sales ratios in my sample groups start at 17 times trailing revenue for Palantir, stretching to 31 for Nvidia. Profit-based ratios are even wilder with price-to-free cash flow metrics in the mid-70s. CrowdStrike isn't even profitable in terms of earnings, reinvesting its operating income in growth-boosting AI research and heavy marketing budgets."", ""Yet, the AI surge left a couple of top-notch names behind. In particular, I think it's high time to consider investing in International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) right now. This proven leader in business-grade AI tools never got the memo about soaring stock prices, and its shares look ridiculously undervalued today."", ""I'm not here to remind you of IBM's illustrious history in AI research. That backdrop gives Big Blue another selling point to pull out in contract negotiations, but most deals aren't won by looking back at years gone by. So instead, let's talk about how IBM is pursuing the AI business today and in the future."", ""The IBM you see today bears little resemblance to the one-stop shop for information technology (IT) needs you got used to in the 1990s and early 2000s. The company refocused its considerable assets on so-called strategic imperatives under CEOs Ginni Rometty and Arvind Krishna. Over the years, the themes of cloud computing and AI emerged as the most important of these overarching goals. The company spun off or sold several slow-growth business operations that didn't fit the new mold, resulting in lower top-line sales but robust cash flows."", ""Many investors lost patience with this slow process, starting in 2012 and arguably still ongoing today. IBM's stock price fell more than 40% (not counting a temporary 48% drop in the early coronavirus panic) before starting a modest comeback. Even with the stock at today's multiyear highs, IBM investors have seen a 5% price drop since the end of 2011. The S&P 500 index rose by 277% over the same period, so Big Blue hasn't been a long-term market-beater."", ""And maybe that's why IBM's stock hasn't enjoyed raging gains in the recent AI frenzy. How can this long-term underperformer deliver valuable innovation in this fast-paced technology era?"", ""That undervaluing is a big mistake in my view. You see, this is where IBM's rubber should hit the road. The company has spent years preparing for exactly this opportunity, quietly building an unmatched portfolio of business-to-business AI tools and services."", 'For example:', ""IBM's Watson AI platform offers cloud-based services in data analysis, natural language processing, deep learning, and more. Based on 70 years of research and customer requests, this system was designed from the ground up to meet the needs of corporate customers."", ""Following the ChatGPT furor, IBM added generative AI functions to its app development and data analytics platform, creating the new Watsonx platform. This system can take IBM's data-processing features, add your own business data, and produce actionable insights with game-changing business value. It's like ChatGPT in a business suit, always carrying a briefcase full of your company's most valuable data."", 'Going forward, IBM benefits from selling its unique AI products to new and existing clients -- but also from helping customers make the most of their new AI tools. ""We are the only provider today that provides an integrated technology IT stack around our Watsonx platform and brings to bear the consulting services expertise to actually help clients deploy and run their GenAI solutions,"" CFO Jim Kavanaugh said at a recent investor conference.', ""I can only scratch the surface of IBM's vast AI operations in this brief treatise. Many books have been written on this subject and the company receives thousands of AI patents every year, if you're looking for some light bedside reading. But I think it's clear that IBM has started to flex its robust AI muscles, most likely resulting in impressive business results in 2024 and beyond."", 'Enterprise-class clients may take some time putting new technology solutions though testing, budget approvals, and multilayer management approvals, but there will be consistently lucrative contracts at the end of that Big Blue rainbow.', ""Market makers are missing that behind-the-scenes success story so far, which is why IBM's stock only gained 14% over the last year and trades at just 2.5 times sales and 12.6 times free cash flow right now. Lifting these ratios just a little closer to the lofty appraisals of Nvidia, CrowdStrike, and Palantir would result in dramatic price gains -- at long last."", ""IBM's journey in the AI landscape has been a story of strategic transformation and undervalued potential. While market darlings have grabbed headlines with soaring valuations, IBM has quietly built a formidable AI arsenal, from the versatile Watson AI platform to the innovative Watsonx system tailored for business applications. This blend of cutting-edge technology and enterprise-focused solutions positions IBM uniquely in the AI domain, and the stock is essentially on fire sale."", ""It's an opportunity for investors to back a seasoned tech giant poised for a resurgence in the era of AI, at a valuation that leaves room for significant growth."", ""As we move further into 2024, keeping an eye on IBM's progress in deploying its AI solutions and capturing market share will be crucial. For those willing to look beyond the hype, IBM's value-priced stock looks like a smart and low-cost investment choice in the rapidly evolving AI sector."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

This question is rarely posed anymore since data has overwhelmingly proved that investing in the stock markets is one of the best ways to increase your wealth over time. A report in October 2023 by the Wall Street Journal talked about the rise of ""mini-millionaires"" and how the average wealth of American families was increasing, citing data from the Federal Reserve. Mini-millionaires usually make about $150,000 and $250,000 a year. The report said between 2019 and 2022 families in the 80th to 90th percentile of the income distribution saw the biggest rise in their incomes as their median wealth increased by about 69% from 2019 through 2022, adjusted for inflation.', 'The report said that over 90% of these families reported owning stocks, either directly or indirectly.', ""Needless to say, investing in the stock market is full of crevices. You can't expect to get rich investing in low-quality stocks and random companies with no value. Investing in stocks to become rich involves patience, wise choices and sticking to traditional investing principles. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had in 2000 foreseen the changing trends in the stock market where investors were becoming impatient, expecting to make money without paying attention to the actual fundamentals of companies. But Klarman at the time had also predicted the return of traditional methods of evaluating companies before investing. In his letter to investors Klarman had said:"", '""If Paul Harvey\'s serialized radio program ""The Rest of the Story"" were applied to Wall Street, it would describe the sad denouement of many such ""story"" stocks. The unraveling of the virtuous circle of growth is not pretty, with earnings shortfalls, plunging share prices, employees with under-water options jumping ship, overzealous shareholders receiving margin calls, accounting chicanery exposed, lawsuits filed, and, to come full circle, the final insult of deletion from the relevant major market index. At this time, attractive valuation is not considered a good story. A slow growth or no growth company trading at one half or one third of its underlying value attracts no important constituency of investors. I sometimes joke about the new market valuation rules of thumb: stocks that fail to meet earnings expectations all seem to trade at 10 times reduced earnings, while formerly profitable companies that report losses all seem to trade at five dollars per share. Many investors avoid these stocks precisely because others are staying away. Why would those kind of stocks ever go up, they wonder. Even those of us with value investing in our DNA generally prefer situations with catalysts for the realization of underlying value.', 'Over time, this will change. At some unknowable future point, the undervaluation of small capitalization stocks lacking exciting growth characteristics will become so gaping that investors will once again be attracted. The point of investing, after all, is not to have a great story to tell; the point of investing is to make money with limited risk. At some point, investors will drop their Pulitzer prize winning story stocks and revisit their attention on the old classics, stocks that make you money because their undervaluation creates a compelling imbalance between risk and return.""', 'Seth Klarman of Baupost Group', 'Methodology', 'For this article we scoured various analyst reports and interviews to pick 11 stocks that experts believe can make one rich in the next 5-10 years.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 16', 'ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) is one of the stocks that can make one rich in the next few years according to Wall Street analysts.

We are particularly encouraged by market research revealing an intent to prescribe for demodex blepharitis (DB) of 93%. As awareness grows, our conviction in TP-03’s market potential is reinforced. Additionally, we believe TP-03 could benefit from key differences between DB and dry eye disease (DED) markets.

We should have hedged the exposure sooner with a Utility ETF short, but we did not do that until the third quarter, after much of the damage was already done. As noted above, our Utility exposure is second only to our materials exposure in terms of negative impact on the portfolio across both the third quarter and the YTD periods. This is primarily driven by our investment in\xa0The AES Corporation\xa0(NYSE:AES), which was down roughly 26% in the third quarter and 47% YTD. Our other utility exposure is up for the year, including our short position, which, as noted, was put on in the third quarter, and it is probably something we should have had on the books for the entire year.', 'We attribute, for right or wrong, the entirety of the sell-off in AES to the interest rate environment.

Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon.

But if you take a closer look at the income statement of Royal Caribbean (NYSE: RCL)\xa0or any cruise line, you'll see that there's a lot more going on."", ""Here's why buying a ticket to take a Royal Caribbean cruise is just the start of the company's revenue stream and why you need to care."", 'The pivotal year for cruising was 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic effectively shut the industry down. Since that nadir, cruise lines have been trying to get their businesses back on track.', 'That task is largely complete for Royal Caribbean. In the third quarter, the company reported that its bookings were ""significantly exceeding 2019 levels."" And, looking forward, ""Demand for 2024 has continued to accelerate, with bookings significantly and consistently outpacing 2019 levels.""', 'However, the most important sign that the Royal Caribbean\'s business has moved past the pandemic was this line: ""Booked load factors and rates are higher than all prior years while the booking window has continued to extend."" Putting that into plain English, Royal Caribbean is selling more tickets at higher prices than at any time in its history.', ""This is, obviously, great news. However, investors need to understand that the ticket is just the start of the story. This is made very clear when you look at the company's income statement. On the top line, which is revenue or sales, the company lists two items: passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue."", 'One of the draws of a cruise is the all-inclusive nature of the trip. You get to ride on the ship, eat three meals a day, and enjoy a host of entertainment options.', 'But there are other ways for customers to spend their money, too. Most ships have casinos, and not all food items (notably alcohol) are included in the ticket price. There are excursions at the ports of call and shopping venues on the ship itself. All of these items require additional spending, and it adds up quickly.', ""In the third quarter, Royal Caribbean's revenue totaled $4.16 billion. Cruise tickets made up around 70% of the total. The other 30% or so was on-ship spending. This dual revenue source is a lot like what you see at an amusement park, which cruise ships have increasingly started to look like as they add rides and other attractions."", 'Here\'s the more interesting thing. Further down on the income statement, there\'s a line item called ""total cruise operating expenses."" In the third quarter, that figure was $2.1 billion, just $800 million or so lower than the ticket revenue of $2.94 billion.', ""Although there are clearly costs in the cruise operating expenses that are tied to onboard spending, back-of-the-envelope math suggests that the $1.2 billion in onboard spending is mostly profit. This is highlighted by the fact that the company's operating income (which doesn't include interest expenses, among other things) in the third quarter was $1.27 billion or so."", ""The first thing investors need to understand about Royal Caribbean's business is that it has recovered from the pandemic. In fact, it looks like this cruise line has more than recovered. And that is good news."", ""The second thing is that tickets are just one part of the revenue equation and, perhaps, represent the starting block on which the company builds its business. That's great news today, but if a recession leads to a drop in ticket sales, the company will also experience a drop in onboard spending, effectively exacerbating the revenue hit. This is a nuance that investors don't want to ignore."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Royal Caribbean Cruises right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Royal Caribbean Cruises, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Royal Caribbean Cruises wasn't one of them.

However, the company's performance last year proved why it's one of the most reliable stock investments over the long term, as it strategically brought its business back to growth."", ""Poor market conditions led Amazon to introduce a range of cost-cutting measures, such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses, laying off thousands of employees, and sunsetting unprofitable divisions like Amazon Care. The restructuring paid off, as the company's free cash flow has soared 427% over the last year."", ""Amazon's ability to successfully navigate economically challenging conditions makes it an excellent option after a market downturn.

That might be an opportunity for investors to buy stocks at a discount, but it's also a good idea to trim any holdings that may not perform during a future rally."", ""With that in mind, here's why Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) stock is a buy, whereas Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON)\xa0may be worth avoiding."", ""Artificial intelligence (AI) was the dominant stock market theme in 2023. Oracle isn't typically considered a top AI company like Nvidia or Microsoft, but investors might be overlooking an incredible opportunity. Oracle was founded in 1977 and has developed everything from database management software to a comprehensive portfolio of cloud computing services. Now, the company is focused squarely on AI."", ""Oracle operates 66 data centers worldwide, which it's currently upgrading to deliver the necessary computing power to handle AI workloads for its business customers. On top of that, it's building 100 more AI-focused data centers right now because it simply can't keep up with demand. Most of that infrastructure will be fitted with the latest semiconductors from Nvidia, which are designed specifically to train, develop, and deploy AI applications."", ""The average business simply can't afford to build its own AI infrastructure, given a single Nvidia H100 GPU chip costs $40,000 -- and some workloads require thousands of them. Companies like Oracle build data centers at scale and generate revenue by renting computing power to developers all over the world. Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison says his company has developed the most advanced Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters in the industry, which can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of other cloud providers."", ""That's why Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is attracting some of the brightest AI start-ups, including Mosaic ML, Adept AI, and even Elon Musk's xAI. In the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30), Ellison said Oracle simply couldn't provide Musk with as many GPU clusters as he wanted, a consequence of such enormous demand and short supply. Oracle could experience substantial revenue growth as its new data centers gradually come online."", ""During Q3, OCI accounted for just 12% of Oracle's $12.9 billion in total revenue. However, the segment grew by a whopping 52% year over year, and Ellison said growth will likely remain at that level for years to come. At that pace, it won't take long for OCI to become a dominant part of Oracle's revenue base and drive the entire company forward."", ""Oracle stock is trading at 14% below its all-time high, and based on the company's $3.62 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 29.9. That's a slight discount to the 30.1 P/E of the Nasdaq-100 technology index, but it's a sizable 21% discount to the 37.7 P/E of fellow AI cloud giant Microsoft."", 'By all accounts, Oracle stock looks like a great buy right now. But any weakness from here will only make the opportunity even more attractive.', ""Peloton stock was a pandemic darling, but it has collapsed by 96% from the all-time high it set in 2020. The company produces at-home exercise equipment featuring a digital screen that allows users to stream music, entertainment, and even virtual fitness classes. Naturally, Peloton's exercise bike and treadmill were a hit during COVID-19 lockdowns because gyms were closed, but demand has sharply reversed ever since."", ""Peloton's annual revenue peaked at $4 billion in fiscal 2021 (ended June 30, 2021). It fell to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2022 (ended June 30, 2022) and again to $2.8 billion in fiscal 2023 (ended June 30, 2023). When a company's revenue falls so quickly -- and unexpectedly -- it's hard to adjust its cost structure to a suitable level. It's a slow process that involves laying off employees, producing fewer products, investing less in research and development, optimizing marketing spending, and more."", ""Peloton hired a new CEO, Barry McCarthy, at the beginning of 2022 for that purpose. He quickly slashed the company's workforce by more than half, offshored manufacturing to save money, and introduced new sales strategies. Unfortunately, Peloton continues to lose substantial amounts of money, including $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2023) showed that losses are slowing, but the company was still in the red to the tune of $159 million."", ""After stripping out one-off and non-cash expenses, like restructuring charges and stock-based compensation, Peloton's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)\xa0was positive by $9.1 million during Q1. Still, money is flowing out the door, and the company has only $748 million in cash on hand, with an outstanding debt of $691 million."", 'Peloton will likely need a cash infusion in the future, which could lead to heavy dilution for investors, given its stock price is so beaten down.', ""The company is working hard to turn things around. It recently announced a slew of brand partnerships with leading sports franchises, universities, and even activewear giant Lululemon to help drive more sales. Plus, Peloton now offers its equipment on a subscription basis, meaning customers don't have to fork out thousands of dollars up front. That's a smart move, especially in this tough economic climate."", ""Despite those positive developments, Wall Street analysts predict Peloton's revenue will shrink yet again in fiscal 2024, albeit by a modest 2%. Without revenue growth, the company will have to slash costs even further to avoid losing significant amounts of money at the bottom line. That means it will be investing less in growth initiatives like marketing and product development, which could drive a further reduction in revenue going forward."", ""Simply put, Peloton is stuck in a very difficult downward spiral, and it's difficult to predict whether the company can survive without a fresh cash injection.

Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had in 2000 foreseen the changing trends in the stock market where investors were becoming impatient, expecting to make money without paying attention to the actual fundamentals of companies. But Klarman at the time had also predicted the return of traditional methods of evaluating companies before investing. In his letter to investors Klarman had said:"", '""If Paul Harvey\'s serialized radio program ""The Rest of the Story"" were applied to Wall Street, it would describe the sad denouement of many such ""story"" stocks. The unraveling of the virtuous circle of growth is not pretty, with earnings shortfalls, plunging share prices, employees with under-water options jumping ship, overzealous shareholders receiving margin calls, accounting chicanery exposed, lawsuits filed, and, to come full circle, the final insult of deletion from the relevant major market index. At this time, attractive valuation is not considered a good story. A slow growth or no growth company trading at one half or one third of its underlying value attracts no important constituency of investors. I sometimes joke about the new market valuation rules of thumb: stocks that fail to meet earnings expectations all seem to trade at 10 times reduced earnings, while formerly profitable companies that report losses all seem to trade at five dollars per share. Many investors avoid these stocks precisely because others are staying away. Why would those kind of stocks ever go up, they wonder. Even those of us with value investing in our DNA generally prefer situations with catalysts for the realization of underlying value.', 'Over time, this will change. At some unknowable future point, the undervaluation of small capitalization stocks lacking exciting growth characteristics will become so gaping that investors will once again be attracted. The point of investing, after all, is not to have a great story to tell; the point of investing is to make money with limited risk. At some point, investors will drop their Pulitzer prize winning story stocks and revisit their attention on the old classics, stocks that make you money because their undervaluation creates a compelling imbalance between risk and return.""', 'Seth Klarman of Baupost Group', 'Methodology', 'For this article we scoured various analyst reports and interviews to pick 11 stocks that experts believe can make one rich in the next 5-10 years.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 16', 'ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) is one of the stocks that can make one rich in the next few years according to Wall Street analysts.

Over the last 10 years, Amazon shares have returned 659%, meaning a $10,000 investment in early 2014 would be worth nearly $76,000 as of this writing.', 'AMZN Total Return Level data by YCharts.', ""In short, Amazon is a great company.

Moreover, free cash flow -- the lifeblood of a mature, dividend-paying company -- has grown from $6.0 billion to more than $10.2 billion.

Let's look at why Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) could also have a place in your portfolio in 2024 and beyond. "", 'With a market cap of $1.79 trillion, Alphabet is already the fourth-largest company in the world, and it will take a lot of momentum to power continued expansion. But AI may be able to do the trick. The tech giant is heavily incorporating AI infrastructure into its cloud-computing platform, which could generate much-needed diversification and long-term growth.', 'Among AI companies, Nvidia is particularly successful because it targets the ""picks and shovels"" side of the opportunity, minimizing competition while maximizing the total addressable market for its products. Google is developing a similar strategy (albeit higher on the value chain) by turning Google Cloud into a one-stop shop for all its enterprise clients\' data-management and AI training needs. And while Google isn\'t the only cloud-service provider employing this strategy, it has some key advantages. ', ""According to CEO Sundar Pichai, 70% of generative AI start-up unicorns use Google's infrastructure to train and run their models. This is a big vote of confidence in the platform's quality and price point. And Google plans to build on this advantage with proprietary AI chips (called tensor processing units), which can bring down costs through vertical integration and reduce the company's reliance on third-party suppliers like Nvidia. "", ""Alphabet's low valuation is icing on the cake for investors. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 22, the stock is significantly cheaper than the NASDAQ 100's estimate of 29. "", ""Following the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, Meta's share price has been on a tear, jumping a substantial 174% in the last 12 months alone. Investors are optimistic about the company's decision to pivot away from metaverse development to focus more on generative AI, which could optimize its advertising and improve its consumer-facing platforms."", ""At first glance, Meta has some clear advantages in its AI efforts. The social media giant's business model has always involved gathering and monetizing huge amounts of data. And generative AI opens another avenue for this strategy through large language models (LLMs), which are algorithms designed to create content out of trained datasets. "", ""Meta is also adding conversational AI experiences across its popular apps, introducing features ranging from more responsive image editing on Instagram to conversational chatbots with distinct personalities on WhatsApp. These efforts probably won't immediately impact Meta's operational performance, but they could help maintain its platforms' user engagement and generate valuable customer data. "", ""On the operational side, Meta is bouncing back from the challenges it faced in 2022. Third-quarter (2023) revenue jumped by 23% year over year to $34.15 billion, while net income jumped 164% to $11.58 billion, helped by aggressive cost cutting and layoffs. And with a forward P/E of just 22, it isn't too late for investors to bet on the company's long-term potential. "", 'In 2024 and beyond, investors should expect the AI landscape to become increasingly competitive, especially on the software side of the market. With that in mind, it makes sense to bet on companies with potential economic moats.

Over the years, the themes of cloud computing and AI emerged as the most important of these overarching goals. The company spun off or sold several slow-growth business operations that didn't fit the new mold, resulting in lower top-line sales but robust cash flows."", ""Many investors lost patience with this slow process, starting in 2012 and arguably still ongoing today. IBM's stock price fell more than 40% (not counting a temporary 48% drop in the early coronavirus panic) before starting a modest comeback. Even with the stock at today's multiyear highs, IBM investors have seen a 5% price drop since the end of 2011. The S&P 500 index rose by 277% over the same period, so Big Blue hasn't been a long-term market-beater."", ""And maybe that's why IBM's stock hasn't enjoyed raging gains in the recent AI frenzy. How can this long-term underperformer deliver valuable innovation in this fast-paced technology era?"", ""That undervaluing is a big mistake in my view. You see, this is where IBM's rubber should hit the road. The company has spent years preparing for exactly this opportunity, quietly building an unmatched portfolio of business-to-business AI tools and services."", 'For example:', ""IBM's Watson AI platform offers cloud-based services in data analysis, natural language processing, deep learning, and more. Based on 70 years of research and customer requests, this system was designed from the ground up to meet the needs of corporate customers."", ""Following the ChatGPT furor, IBM added generative AI functions to its app development and data analytics platform, creating the new Watsonx platform. This system can take IBM's data-processing features, add your own business data, and produce actionable insights with game-changing business value. It's like ChatGPT in a business suit, always carrying a briefcase full of your company's most valuable data."", 'Going forward, IBM benefits from selling its unique AI products to new and existing clients -- but also from helping customers make the most of their new AI tools. ""We are the only provider today that provides an integrated technology IT stack around our Watsonx platform and brings to bear the consulting services expertise to actually help clients deploy and run their GenAI solutions,"" CFO Jim Kavanaugh said at a recent investor conference.', ""I can only scratch the surface of IBM's vast AI operations in this brief treatise. Many books have been written on this subject and the company receives thousands of AI patents every year, if you're looking for some light bedside reading. But I think it's clear that IBM has started to flex its robust AI muscles, most likely resulting in impressive business results in 2024 and beyond."", 'Enterprise-class clients may take some time putting new technology solutions though testing, budget approvals, and multilayer management approvals, but there will be consistently lucrative contracts at the end of that Big Blue rainbow.', ""Market makers are missing that behind-the-scenes success story so far, which is why IBM's stock only gained 14% over the last year and trades at just 2.5 times sales and 12.6 times free cash flow right now. Lifting these ratios just a little closer to the lofty appraisals of Nvidia, CrowdStrike, and Palantir would result in dramatic price gains -- at long last."", ""IBM's journey in the AI landscape has been a story of strategic transformation and undervalued potential. While market darlings have grabbed headlines with soaring valuations, IBM has quietly built a formidable AI arsenal, from the versatile Watson AI platform to the innovative Watsonx system tailored for business applications. This blend of cutting-edge technology and enterprise-focused solutions positions IBM uniquely in the AI domain, and the stock is essentially on fire sale."", ""It's an opportunity for investors to back a seasoned tech giant poised for a resurgence in the era of AI, at a valuation that leaves room for significant growth."", ""As we move further into 2024, keeping an eye on IBM's progress in deploying its AI solutions and capturing market share will be crucial. For those willing to look beyond the hype, IBM's value-priced stock looks like a smart and low-cost investment choice in the rapidly evolving AI sector."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

This was a boon for semiconductor chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which produces high-performance chips well suited to AI.', ""This hunger for AI products helped to drive the company's stock price from a 52-week low of $67.27 last January to a high of $151.05 by December. So, does AMD's dramatic stock price surge mean it's now too late to buy shares?"", 'As 2024 kicks off, the stock remains near its 52-week high. But could it potentially rise even higher? Digging into the company can help to assess whether AMD is a worthwhile investment.', ""Certainly, AMD stands to benefit from the rise of AI. For instance, Microsoft is incorporating AMD's AI chips into its Windows PC operating system as part of a multiyear partnership. And corporations, such as Facebook parent Meta, are looking to AMD's AI processors as a lower-cost alternative to those provided by industry leader Nvidia."", 'AMD\'s CEO Lisa Su noted that the appetite for the company\'s MI300 accelerators, its data center-specific AI product, is so strong that it looks to be ""the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.""\xa0To capitalize on this demand, AMD acquired AI software companies Nod.ai and Mipsology in 2023 to strengthen its AI offerings. Nod.ai allows customers to automate the implementation and optimization of AI chips. Mipsology assists AI software in running through data and making decisions, a process known as inference.', ""The company's AI progress helped to buoy AMD's stock price. But the next test comes when AMD releases its fourth-quarter earnings results later this year."", ""In its third quarter, the company generated revenue of $5.8 billion, a 4% jump over the prior year. AMD expects around $6 billion in Q4 sales, an increase over 2022's $5.6 billion. AMD's Q4 revenue would likely need to surge past these expectations for its stock price to rise higher, however."", ""Despite the potential upside, over the long term, AMD's business is susceptible to the cyclical nature of the computer hardware industry. When PC or gaming console sales drop, for example, demand for AMD's chips also declines, hurting its revenue."", ""This was the case in the first quarter of 2023. AMD revenue was down 9% year over year due to sales softness in the PC market. The Q1 revenue decline was significant enough to cause the company to suffer a net loss of $139 million in the quarter, a substantial 118% drop from 2022's net income of $786 million."", ""Another factor to consider is AMD's high stock valuation. Currently, the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio)\xa0of 1,156 over the trailing 12 months is shockingly high. Contrast this with rival Nvidia's P/E multiple of 72. AMD has to deliver impressive financial results going forward to justify its current valuation."", ""Moreover, the average price target for AMD shares among Wall Street analysts is $144.03 at the time of this writing. This is yet another consideration to weigh when evaluating whether AMD's stock is too pricey to warrant an investment right now."", ""AMD's potential business boom from the AI market is a compelling reason to invest, but any short-term revenue boost appears to be priced into the company's stock already. As a result, it's hard to justify buying AMD shares now, given its current sky-high valuation."", 'That could change as AMD delivers on the promise of strong AI sales over time. So, a prudent approach would be to wait for the price to dip and pick up shares then.', 'Another strategy is to buy a small position now in case the company manages to smash Wall Street expectations in its Q4 results. Then, use the technique of dollar-cost averaging to add to your position when subsequent price drops occur.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

Robinson.', '“Mexico is an important region for us for various reasons. We do feel that the macroeconomics and geopolitical landscape of the world is certainly changing,” Laxmana told FreightWaves.', 'Almost 40% of U.S. shippers have already taken advantage of nearshoring or are considering it, according to C.H.

We’ve seen manufacturing for specific verticals going to India, going to Pakistan, going to different locations.

The fact remains, Mexico has a growing pool of skilled labor, particularly manufacturing and engineering.

It certainly helps the broader connectivity to do what we’re looking for.”', 'Cross-border freight that is expected to see significant growth in 2024 starts with auto parts and vehicles, Laxmana said.', '“Certainly the automotive industry goes without saying for growth,” Laxmana said. “If we look at some of the investments being made, you continue to see those very secondary original equipment manufacturers continue to invest. But growth really depends on some different factors — such as what is the availability for raw materials? If there’s no raw materials, then it’s very difficult to manufacture, so how do you get those raw materials there? I do feel other manufacturing industries are certainly following suit, but they have some different factors involved prior to making those decisions.”', 'C.H.

This question is rarely posed anymore since data has overwhelmingly proved that investing in the stock markets is one of the best ways to increase your wealth over time. A report in October 2023 by the Wall Street Journal talked about the rise of ""mini-millionaires"" and how the average wealth of American families was increasing, citing data from the Federal Reserve. Mini-millionaires usually make about $150,000 and $250,000 a year. The report said between 2019 and 2022 families in the 80th to 90th percentile of the income distribution saw the biggest rise in their incomes as their median wealth increased by about 69% from 2019 through 2022, adjusted for inflation.', 'The report said that over 90% of these families reported owning stocks, either directly or indirectly.', ""Needless to say, investing in the stock market is full of crevices. You can't expect to get rich investing in low-quality stocks and random companies with no value. Investing in stocks to become rich involves patience, wise choices and sticking to traditional investing principles. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had in 2000 foreseen the changing trends in the stock market where investors were becoming impatient, expecting to make money without paying attention to the actual fundamentals of companies. But Klarman at the time had also predicted the return of traditional methods of evaluating companies before investing. In his letter to investors Klarman had said:"", '""If Paul Harvey\'s serialized radio program ""The Rest of the Story"" were applied to Wall Street, it would describe the sad denouement of many such ""story"" stocks. The unraveling of the virtuous circle of growth is not pretty, with earnings shortfalls, plunging share prices, employees with under-water options jumping ship, overzealous shareholders receiving margin calls, accounting chicanery exposed, lawsuits filed, and, to come full circle, the final insult of deletion from the relevant major market index. At this time, attractive valuation is not considered a good story. A slow growth or no growth company trading at one half or one third of its underlying value attracts no important constituency of investors. I sometimes joke about the new market valuation rules of thumb: stocks that fail to meet earnings expectations all seem to trade at 10 times reduced earnings, while formerly profitable companies that report losses all seem to trade at five dollars per share. Many investors avoid these stocks precisely because others are staying away. Why would those kind of stocks ever go up, they wonder. Even those of us with value investing in our DNA generally prefer situations with catalysts for the realization of underlying value.', 'Over time, this will change. At some unknowable future point, the undervaluation of small capitalization stocks lacking exciting growth characteristics will become so gaping that investors will once again be attracted. The point of investing, after all, is not to have a great story to tell; the point of investing is to make money with limited risk. At some point, investors will drop their Pulitzer prize winning story stocks and revisit their attention on the old classics, stocks that make you money because their undervaluation creates a compelling imbalance between risk and return.""', 'Seth Klarman of Baupost Group', 'Methodology', 'For this article we scoured various analyst reports and interviews to pick 11 stocks that experts believe can make one rich in the next 5-10 years.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 16', 'ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) is one of the stocks that can make one rich in the next few years according to Wall Street analysts.

Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating.

That's a wise decision, but one that requires extra care when you think about individual investments. In other words, a high yield alone isn't enough information to go on. You need to dig deeper."", 'This is why Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) are high-yield stocks worth taking a closer look at and Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) is a stock you should probably avoid. Let me explain.', 'When it comes down to it, dividend investors put excitement low on their priority list when examining potential investments. At the top of the list is most likely a reliable income stream. And right up there with it is a revenue stream that trends higher over time. On that score, Enbridge has increased its dividend annually for 28 consecutive years while Enterprise has increased its distribution for 25 years. That consistency strongly suggests a huge amount of reliability, especially when you consider that both companies operate in the highly volatile energy sector. The key is that they are midstream providers.', 'Midstream companies own the infrastructure, like pipelines, that help to move oil and natural gas, and the products into which they get turned, around the world. Enbridge and Enterprise charge fees for the use of these product-moving assets, which creates a very reliable income stream. That means demand is more important than commodity prices for most midstream companies. And demand for energy tends to remain robust even during energy downturns.', 'On top of that, both Enbridge and Enterprise are investment-grade rated. So they have strong balance sheets to help them weather any weak patches that may come along. They also have reasonable distribution policies, so there is room for adversity before their dividends would be at risk.', ""In other words, Enbridge and Enterprise are built to be reliable income stocks. If you are trying to maximize the income your portfolio generates, you'll probably want to look at each given the attractive 7.3% and 7.4% respective yields."", ""Having a steadily growing dividend is great, but it isn't the only dividend policy you'll find in the energy patch. At the complete opposite extreme is Devon Energy. This company operates in the upstream segment, producing oil and natural gas. That means that its top and bottom lines are almost entirely dependent on highly volatile commodity prices. Good years can be great, but bad years can be brutal."", ""To reward investors during the good years Devon has chosen to institute a variable dividend policy that is tied to the company's financial performance. It is a fairly efficient and direct way to ensure that investors benefit from high energy prices, but it requires shareholders to accept the hit when energy prices decline and the dividend gets cut. The change can be dramatic; the third-quarter 2022 dividend stood at $1.55 per share and one year later it had fallen to just $0.49. That's a level of volatility that will probably put most dividend investors off, even though the stock's current 6.7% yield looks very attractive."", ""At the end of the day, the big story here is that a high yield alone isn't enough to make any investment a buy. You need to dig a bit deeper to understand the company behind the yield. Enbridge and Enterprise are built to provide shareholders with reliable income. Devon Energy isn't."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Enterprise Products Partners wasn't one of them.

It soared 16% between late October and the end of December, coming within inches of a new all-time high. But the index opened 2024 with a little volatility and has given back a fraction of those gains.', ""One Wall Street analyst, Fundstrat's Tom Lee, thinks the broader market could see a 7% drop in the short term before heading higher later this year. That might be an opportunity for investors to buy stocks at a discount, but it's also a good idea to trim any holdings that may not perform during a future rally."", ""With that in mind, here's why Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) stock is a buy, whereas Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON)\xa0may be worth avoiding."", ""Artificial intelligence (AI) was the dominant stock market theme in 2023. Oracle isn't typically considered a top AI company like Nvidia or Microsoft, but investors might be overlooking an incredible opportunity. Oracle was founded in 1977 and has developed everything from database management software to a comprehensive portfolio of cloud computing services. Now, the company is focused squarely on AI."", ""Oracle operates 66 data centers worldwide, which it's currently upgrading to deliver the necessary computing power to handle AI workloads for its business customers. On top of that, it's building 100 more AI-focused data centers right now because it simply can't keep up with demand. Most of that infrastructure will be fitted with the latest semiconductors from Nvidia, which are designed specifically to train, develop, and deploy AI applications."", ""The average business simply can't afford to build its own AI infrastructure, given a single Nvidia H100 GPU chip costs $40,000 -- and some workloads require thousands of them. Companies like Oracle build data centers at scale and generate revenue by renting computing power to developers all over the world. Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison says his company has developed the most advanced Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters in the industry, which can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of other cloud providers."", ""That's why Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is attracting some of the brightest AI start-ups, including Mosaic ML, Adept AI, and even Elon Musk's xAI. In the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30), Ellison said Oracle simply couldn't provide Musk with as many GPU clusters as he wanted, a consequence of such enormous demand and short supply. Oracle could experience substantial revenue growth as its new data centers gradually come online."", ""During Q3, OCI accounted for just 12% of Oracle's $12.9 billion in total revenue. However, the segment grew by a whopping 52% year over year, and Ellison said growth will likely remain at that level for years to come. At that pace, it won't take long for OCI to become a dominant part of Oracle's revenue base and drive the entire company forward."", ""Oracle stock is trading at 14% below its all-time high, and based on the company's $3.62 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 29.9. That's a slight discount to the 30.1 P/E of the Nasdaq-100 technology index, but it's a sizable 21% discount to the 37.7 P/E of fellow AI cloud giant Microsoft."", 'By all accounts, Oracle stock looks like a great buy right now. But any weakness from here will only make the opportunity even more attractive.', ""Peloton stock was a pandemic darling, but it has collapsed by 96% from the all-time high it set in 2020. The company produces at-home exercise equipment featuring a digital screen that allows users to stream music, entertainment, and even virtual fitness classes. Naturally, Peloton's exercise bike and treadmill were a hit during COVID-19 lockdowns because gyms were closed, but demand has sharply reversed ever since."", ""Peloton's annual revenue peaked at $4 billion in fiscal 2021 (ended June 30, 2021). It fell to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2022 (ended June 30, 2022) and again to $2.8 billion in fiscal 2023 (ended June 30, 2023). When a company's revenue falls so quickly -- and unexpectedly -- it's hard to adjust its cost structure to a suitable level. It's a slow process that involves laying off employees, producing fewer products, investing less in research and development, optimizing marketing spending, and more."", ""Peloton hired a new CEO, Barry McCarthy, at the beginning of 2022 for that purpose. He quickly slashed the company's workforce by more than half, offshored manufacturing to save money, and introduced new sales strategies. Unfortunately, Peloton continues to lose substantial amounts of money, including $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2023) showed that losses are slowing, but the company was still in the red to the tune of $159 million."", ""After stripping out one-off and non-cash expenses, like restructuring charges and stock-based compensation, Peloton's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)\xa0was positive by $9.1 million during Q1. Still, money is flowing out the door, and the company has only $748 million in cash on hand, with an outstanding debt of $691 million."", 'Peloton will likely need a cash infusion in the future, which could lead to heavy dilution for investors, given its stock price is so beaten down.', ""The company is working hard to turn things around. It recently announced a slew of brand partnerships with leading sports franchises, universities, and even activewear giant Lululemon to help drive more sales. Plus, Peloton now offers its equipment on a subscription basis, meaning customers don't have to fork out thousands of dollars up front. That's a smart move, especially in this tough economic climate."", ""Despite those positive developments, Wall Street analysts predict Peloton's revenue will shrink yet again in fiscal 2024, albeit by a modest 2%. Without revenue growth, the company will have to slash costs even further to avoid losing significant amounts of money at the bottom line. That means it will be investing less in growth initiatives like marketing and product development, which could drive a further reduction in revenue going forward."", ""Simply put, Peloton is stuck in a very difficult downward spiral, and it's difficult to predict whether the company can survive without a fresh cash injection.

We have also discussed the latest statistics on seniors returning to jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Low-Stress Jobs for Seniors.', 'As individuals age, they may prioritize a work environment that offers reduced stress levels to enhance overall well-being and quality of life. Many seniors look forward to retirement as a phase of life that comes with relaxation, leisure, and spending time with loved ones. Consequently, opting for low-stress jobs helps them maintain a healthier work-life balance and transition smoothly into retirement. According to popular beliefs, dietitian and gardeners are considered two of the most stress-free jobs for seniors.\xa0', 'Age should not be the sole determinant of one\'s ability to work. Many individuals remain active, productive, and engaged in their careers well into their 70s too. Infact, around 20% of Americans, as per a recent T. Rowe Price study, have chosen to ""unretire,"" opting for full or part-time employment. The average retirement age has risen to 61, with retirees now working longer due to economic uncertainty and pandemic-related factors. By March 2022, 1.5 million retirees had rejoined the labor force. The recent stock market volatility has negatively impacted retirement accounts, prompting some to return to work to recoup losses and secure additional income. Financial incentives have also player a key role, with 48% citing the need to work for financial reasons.\xa0', 'Additionally, returning to work offers social and mental health benefits, as 45% of respondents in the T. Rowe Price poll re-entered the workforce for interpersonal and emotional reasons. Overall, 57% of retirees express a desire to continue working. It is interesting to note that the motivations differ along gender and marital lines, with women and single retirees more likely to cite income as their primary motivator, while men often highlight social connections.', 'Despite these developments, AARP reports that workplace age discrimination is at its highest since 2003, with 78% of older workers experiencing or witnessing it. Despite these challenges, the current tight labor market, with two open jobs for every worker, makes older workers more in-demand. Companies are increasingly recognizing the benefits of hiring mature workers, as research shows they are more engaged and less likely to quit.\xa0 For example, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has hired former Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) product chief Panos Panay to lead its devices and services unit, replacing longtime Amazon devices head Dave Limp. Panay, oversaw Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s profitable Windows operating-system business and the Surface line of devices. It is also true that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), as a technology giant, is known for its commitment to diversity and inclusion, which also translates into their focus on hiring workers of all age groups.', 'Speaking of the company, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has recently entered a partnership with the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US., comprising 60 unions and representing 12.5 million workers. The collaboration aims to address rising concerns about AI-induced job losses. This alliance marks the first of its kind between a technology company and a labor organization. Starting next winter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) will provide AI training to union workers and leaders, covering trends, technology development, and challenges. The partnership also involves labor summits to gather worker feedback on AI, with the AFL-CIO and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) proposing policies for AI training, including tech apprenticeships.', ""On the other hand, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) Philippines has announced plans to increase the hiring of senior citizens and persons with disabilities (PWDs) in Manila. The fast-food chain aims to recruit individuals who pass their screening for a training program approved by the Public Employment Service Office (PESO) of Manila and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).\xa0"", ""Since the launch of McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)‘s Alternative Work program in 2019, 62 senior citizens and PWDs have been hired. In 2023, the company promised to hire over 500 PWDs and senior citizens across different locations in Metro Manila, with each of the 250 stores nationwide potentially having up to two seniors or PWD staff members."", ""To read more about McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), see our article about the Top 20 Countries With the Most McDonald’s Restaurants."", 'Goodluz/Shutterstock.com', 'To list the low-stress jobs for seniors, we identified 40 jobs with three major characteristics; jobs with predictable workload, jobs with a supportive environment, and jobs with flexible scheduling and remote options. Subsequently, we gauged the collective perception of stress levels associated with these 40 jobs by consulting Reddit as our primary reference. Each job received a score, with lower scores indicating lower stress levels within the respective occupation. This method allowed us to systematically assess and present jobs that align with the preferences and well-being of seniors looking for employment.', 'Here is a list of the 25 low stress jobs for seniors.\xa0', 'IM Score: 40', 'Some seniors become travel agents as a fulfilling post-retirement career.

Rising interest rates increased borrowing costs, which also weighed on the value of many properties.', ""However, those more challenging market conditions didn't stop Prologis (NYSE: PLD) from having another strong year. The leading industrial REIT grew its core funds from operations (FFO) by 11%. That was its fourth straight year of delivering double-digit earnings growth. It has now expanded its core FFO at a 10.3% compound annual rate since the merger that formed it a dozen years ago. It's optimistic that 2024 will be another great year. Here's what's driving that positive view."", 'Prologis\' management team discussed its outlook for 2024 on their recent fourth-quarter conference call. CFO Tim Arndt commented, ""We know that the market is not yet out of the woods with regards to incoming supply, but the combination of a stronger backdrop, continued low level of starts, and a calmer capital markets environment has us optimistic that 2024 will be another great year.""', ""Arndt points out that the warehouse market is dealing with a glut of new supply. Developers started to build lots of new supply coming out of the pandemic, driven by strong demand and low interest rates. While development starts peaked in 2022 as interest rates started rising, completions won't peak until this year when those developments begin coming online:"", ""It will initially take the market some time to absorb that new supply. That means vacancy rates are likely to tick up in the near term, while market rents won't grow as fast."", 'However, the company expects demand to start improving throughout the year. Meanwhile, higher interest rates will probably keep other developers at bay. Sprinkle in the expectations that the capital market will be calmer this year after a rash of bank implosions in 2023, and the company is optimistic it will deliver another strong year of growth.', 'Despite some market headwinds, Prologis expects its existing portfolio to deliver strong results in 2024. The company anticipates occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5% this year, starting lower and gradually rising as demand improves. Meanwhile, it expects market rents to remain strong. That drives its view that its same-store net operating income will grow 8% to 9% this year. A big driver will be its ability to capture higher market rents as legacy leases expire and it signs new leases at much higher rates. ', 'On top of that, Prologis expects to benefit from a big year of development completions. It anticipates stabilizing between $3.6 billion and $4 billion of development projects this year at strong investment yields. ', ""Those two organic growth drivers power its view that it will grow its core FFO to between $5.42 and $5.65 per share. That's about a 9% increase at the mid-point. There's some potential upside because the forecast doesn't assume much impact from acquisitions. The REIT penciled in completing $500 million to $1 billion of property purchases this year, largely offset by dispositions ($800 million to $1.2 billion). Given its balance sheet strength, it could complete more deals this year. Last year, it made $733 million in property acquisitions and bought a portfolio from Blackstone in a $3.1 billion deal. Meanwhile, it acquired fellow REIT Duke Realty in late 2022 in a $23 billion transaction. Another sizable deal could help push the company's FFO per share into the double digits again this year. "", 'Despite some continued supply headwinds, Prologis is optimistic that 2024 could be another great year. The leading industrial REIT has enough embedded organic growth drivers to push its core FFO per share up by around 9% this year, with additional upside potential from acquisitions. That should enable the company to continue increasing its 2.8%-yielding dividend, which it could boost at a double-digit rate again in 2024. Those factors set the company up to potentially deliver a more than 10% total return in the coming year. That strong total return potential makes it look like a great buy right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prologis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prologis, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Prologis wasn't one of them.

The stock returned 3,787,464% from 1965 through 2022. That's more than 150 times the 24,708% return from the S&P 500 index over the same period."", ""Contributing to those returns was the growing value of Berkshire's stock holdings -- a portfolio worth $318 billion at the end of 2023's third quarter. One common theme among its largest stock holdings is that those stocks own strong brands and pay regular dividends."", ""Buffett acknowledged in last year's shareholder letter that stakes in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and American Express (NYSE: AXP), which Berkshire Hathaway has held for decades, have provided it with billions of dollars in unrealized gains from share price appreciation that was partially powered by their growing dividends."", 'These two stakes, along with its massive stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), are set to provide the conglomerate with nearly $2 billion in dividend income over the next year.', ""Coca-Cola is the longest-held position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. In his 2023 shareholder letter, Buffett noted that in 1994, Berkshire completed its multiyear investment in the company -- spending a total of $1.3 billion on what are now (after a pair of 2-for-1 splits in the years that followed) the 400 million shares it still owns. It paid an average of $3.25 per split-adjusted share for that stake. That position is currently worth $24 billion and provides Berkshire Hathaway with annual dividend income of $736 million -- 56% of its original cost basis."", ""Coca-Cola has increased its payouts for 62 consecutive years, and Buffett expects the streak to continue. If Coke raises its quarterly dividend payment by $0.02 per share in 2024 (a level consistent with its boosts in the last two years), Berkshire's dividend check will increase another $8 million to $744 million over the next year."", ""Coke-branded products make up only a third of the company's annual unit case sales volume. The diversity of its brand portfolio, which includes juices, water, and teas, allows the company to market multiple beverages for different occasions and smooth out sales across geographies. Latin America has been one of the company's fastest-growing regions, posting double-digit percentage sales growth last quarter, which offset weaker results elsewhere."", 'Another important reason to expect Coca-Cola to remain a solid income investment is its ability to adapt to shifting consumer preferences. Coke generated nearly a third of its sales volume in 2022 from no-sugar and low-calorie products. Its success with products like Coke Zero fuels its ongoing solid results; non-GAAP (adjusted) revenue was up 11% year over year in the third quarter.', ""Making syrups from concentrate doesn't require a lot of capital. Coca-Cola has a globally recognizable brand and a profitable business model to keep sales, earnings, and dividends growing. Last year, it distributed 72% of its earnings via dividends. Its current yield is 3.05%."", 'Berkshire Hathaway has owned a stake in American Express for almost as long as it has held one in Coca-Cola. The cost basis on that investment was nearly $1.3 billion, or $8.49 per share.', ""Based on American Express' current quarterly payout of $0.60 per share, Berkshire will take in nearly $364 million in dividend income from the financial giant over the next year. At its current share price, Amex's yield is a below-average 1.32%, but it also has a low payout ratio of 21% and is growing profits at double-digit percentage rates that could support further increases in the payout."", 'American Express has similar advantages to those of Coca-Cola, such as strong brand power and a large customer base. At the end of 2022, it had over 76 million Amex cards in force worldwide and another 56 million cards issued by third-party brands.', ""Delta Air Lines is one third-party brand that is a valuable partner for American Express. Delta offers Amex card members travel-related perks, including airport lounge access and other services. It's these benefits, along with membership rewards and exclusive discounts at top retailers, that have built American Express into a desirable card for high-income shoppers."", 'A key advantage for American Express is that its average cardholder spends more on average than the users of other credit cards. The main advantage of this is that it gives American Express leverage with merchants in terms of setting its processing fees.', ""A high-spending membership base is also beneficial during occasional weakness in consumer spending broadly. The soft retail spending environment over the last few years hasn't hurt American Express, which reported record revenue in 2022 and continued to post solid results in 2023. Revenue net of interest expense grew 13% year over year in 2023's third quarter, while earnings jumped 34%."", 'The combination of a strong brand, customer loyalty, and a large network of merchant partners explains why Buffett has held this stock for so long and why he expects the dividend to keep growing.', ""Berkshire Hathaway first bought shares of Apple in 2016. After further share purchases and a 378% increase in Apple's stock price over the last five years, that stake is now worth about $167 billion. It is the largest investment Berkshire Hathaway has ever made in a single stock, and the annual dividend payout should also grow into a sizable amount over the long term."", 'Assuming Berkshire continues to hold 915 million shares of Apple, that stake will provide it with $878 million in dividend income over the next 12 months.', ""Apple has tremendous cash resources that it can invest in technology, but it's the company's brand that Buffett values the most. In terms of its products' technological features, Apple has often lagged its competitors. And yet, Apple remarkably still sells millions of iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches every year. The iPhone is the biggest draw, bringing in $200 billion in annual revenue."", ""Apple's customers are drawn to the experience of the software behind these devices, where content is seamlessly tied together through its iCloud service. This is the heart of Apple's competitive advantage over Samsung and other smartphone rivals. While Apple controls less than 20% of the global smartphone market, it generates over 80% of the industry's profits."", ""A lucrative business model provides Apple with an enormous edge in finances. It held $57 billion of net cash as of the end of September, but management is working to bring that down to a neutral cash position through dividends and share repurchases. Making the task more challenging is that a massive amount of profits floods into the company's coffers every year. In other words, Apple has more cash than it knows what to do with."", ""Apple is now producing $99 billion in trailing free cash flow, which could fund a growing dividend and pave the way for new products and services that widen the company's economic moat. The upcoming Vision Pro mixed-reality headset might take a while to catch on with customers given its $3,499 price tag, but it shows Apple is not going to rely solely on its existing product lineup to drive long-term growth."", ""Like American Express, Apple also has a below-average yield, but what investors give up in yield, they make up for with dividend growth and share price appreciation. The company has more than doubled its payout over the last 10 years and boosted its share price by 873%. Given its low 15% payout ratio, Apple's dividend should grow for many years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

It's taken some time for it to catch on as a digital consumer bank, but even though it's feeling some negative impact from raised interest rates, it's been able to shine under these circumstances. Customers have been looking for higher rates on deposits and easy-to-use services, and Ally is capturing market share. Armed with tons of new members, it's poised to spring forward when economic policy becomes more favorable to banks."", 'Despite higher interest rates, Ally had a record 3.7 million auto loan applications in the third quarter. It had a 30% approval rate and $10.6 billion in originations. It is the top U.S. prime auto lender and the top bank in retail auto loans outstanding.', 'The company added 95,000 consumer banking customers in the 2023 third quarter, a 15% year-over-year increase, for a total of total of 3 million. Seventy-two percent of them are millennial age or younger, and Ally has an industry-leading 96% retention rate. Deposits increased by $7.1 billion for a total of $152.8 billion, and it has demonstrated more than 14 years of retail deposit growth. Customers using more than one product continue to rise, increasing 22% over last year in the third quarter, and 85% of new Ally Invest customers came from existing accounts.', ""Ally doesn't have a strong track record of dividend raises, but it has been paying a dividend reliably, with raises throughout, since 2016. At the current price, Ally's dividend yields 3.4%. That's more than double the S&P 500 average, and it's lower than usual for Ally.

It targets an affluent market that's more resilient during challenging times, and the annual fees it collects from cardmembers provide bottom-line growth, irrespective of how much money cardmembers spend."", 'In fact, 70% of new account signups were for fee-based cards in the 2023 third quarter. Not surprisingly, fees increased 20% year over year and accounted for 12% of total revenue.', 'In the 2023 third quarter, revenue increased 13% over last year. Net income increased 30%, and that was inclusive of a 58% increase in provisions for losses. Banks increase their provisions for losses when defaults are expected to rise, and banks have had to increase their due to higher interest rates.', 'American Express operates a closed-loop credit card network. Unlike other networks like Visa and Mastercard, which partner with financial institutions, American Express acts as its own bank. In that capacity, it benefits from deposits and interest. Net interest income increased 30% over last year in the third quarter as deposits increase and rates are high.', 'Travel and experiences are a major segment for American Express, and this segment is finally getting back to high growth after pandemic-driven declines.

With 89% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.', 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.', ""Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Pentair."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Pentair ', 'Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Pentair. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Pentair's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Pentair. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and Impax Asset Management Group Plc holds about 5.9% of the company stock."", 'Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.', 'While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.', 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', ""Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Pentair plc in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$46m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. "", ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run."", ""I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) can vouch for that claim following Berkshire Hathaway's investment in its stock. The Oracle of Omaha also provided pivotal support for the energy company's acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, which it bought out from under Chevron (NYSE: CVX)."", 'Before you run out and buy Occidental as well just because Buffett (through Berkshire) owns it, though, you need to take a deeper look at what has happened to Occidental since the Anadarko deal.', ""Chevron announced it would be buying Anadarko Petroleum in April 2019. Shortly thereafter, Occidental announced it was making a counteroffer, attempting to buy Anadarko away from Chevron. Buffett was in the mix at this point, helping to fund Occidental's offer. There was a short period of uncertainty in which it was unclear who would end up buying Anadarko and at what price, but in the end, Chevron decided to step away."", ""Even then, Wall Street was highlighting the deal's cost as a potential problem for Occidental. The issue was really about its balance sheet, which was suddenly loaded with debt. While that's hardly an uncommon after-effect of a large acquisition, leverage can be both a powerful tool for good and a huge burden. It quickly turned into the latter when the coronavirus pandemic started to spread in 2020."", 'Governments around the world effectively shut down their economies in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. That, in turn, reduced demand for energy. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices, a key U.S. oil benchmark, actually fell below zero at one point. There were technical reasons for that, but suffice it to say the operating environment for energy companies got much harder shortly after Occidental bagged its quarry.', 'What happened next was hardly a surprise -- Occidental cut its dividend. Chevron, by comparison, continued to increase its dividend. And ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), another major energy competitor, also supported its dividend throughout that downturn. But with a heavy debt load, Occidental needed cash fast. One of the quickest ways to free up money is to cut the dividend.', ""This highlights another lingering difference between Occidental, Chevron, and ExxonMobil that dividend investors should keep in mind now that Occidental has started increasing its dividend again. Before the pandemic, Occidental's leverage (as measured by its debt-to-equity ratio) was roughly similar to that of its larger peers up until 2016 or so. Then, it rose a bit higher and, finally, exploded higher after the Anadarko deal."", ""To be fair, Occidental has worked hard to reduce leverage, and the debt-to-equity ratio has fallen dramatically from its peak levels. The oil industry rebound following the crash in 2020 helped materially in that. But Occidental's debt-to-equity ratio remains well above the levels of ExxonMobil and Chevron and is still higher than before the deal. The magnitude of the difference here matters. Chevron's debt-to-equity ratio is a tiny 0.12 times, and ExxonMobil's is very impressive at 0.2 times. Occidental's ratio is multiples higher at 0.65 times."", ""Warren Buffett's owning a stock often results in other investors following his lead. But just because Buffett owns something doesn't make it right for every investor. In this case, conservative dividend investors got burned if they bought Occidental just because Buffett bought it."", 'While Occidental has worked hard to improve its balance sheet, most conservative investors eying the energy sector, particularly those with a dividend focus, will probably be better served with an investment in ExxonMobil or Chevron, given their more conservative use of leverage.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't one of them.

Berkshire currently owns nearly 28% of Occidental's outstanding shares (and has regulatory approval to buy up to half the company). At 3.8% of its investment portfolio, it's Berkshire's sixth-largest stock holding."", ""However, while Buffett and his team clearly love Occidental, that doesn't mean it's the best oil stock for everyone. Chevron (NYSE: CVX), EnLink Midstream (NYSE: ENLC), and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as better options in the energy sector. Here's why they like them better than Occidental. "", ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (Chevron): Shortly before the coronavirus pandemic, Occidental got into a bidding war with Chevron over Anadarko Petroleum. With the help of Warren Buffett, Oxy won the deal. In the end, Chevron didn't want to overpay, which might have put its rock-solid financial position at risk."", 'Then the pandemic hit, and low oil prices coupled with a heavily leveraged balance sheet forced Occidental to make a dividend cut. Chevron just kept increasing its dividend, largely thanks to the balance sheet flexibility it has so long worked to protect.', ""At this point, after an oil price rally, Occidental is in better financial shape. But its debt-to-equity ratio at 0.65 times is still dramatically higher than Chevron's 0.12 times. The deep 2020 oil bust, which saw oil prices fall below zero in the U.S. market, was a clear indication of Chevron's ability to weather the inherent ups and down in the highly cyclical energy industry. Investors wanting consistency throughout the cycle have clearly done better with Chevron, and that's not likely to change soon."", ""But while Occidental won Anadarko, that setback hasn't stopped Chevron from making acquisitions. Indeed, it recently inked a deal to buy Hess. If you want a company that doesn't have to sacrifice dividend investors for growth, Chevron and its 4.1% yield will be a better choice for you, even if it doesn't win every deal."", ""Matt DiLallo (EnLink Midstream): While oil is Occidental's main fuel source these days, the company is investing heavily to capture a potentially massive future growth driver: carbon capture and storage (CCS). CEO Vicki Hollub has stated that the company could eventually make as much money from CCS as it does from producing oil and gas. It's investing heavily to build out direct air capture (DAC) projects that would suck carbon dioxide from the air for permanent sequestration underground."", ""Occidental isn't the only company seeking to capture the potentially massive CCS market. EnLink Midstream wants to become a leader in transporting carbon dioxide by leveraging its existing pipeline network in the Gulf Coast region to move the gas from capture sites to sequestration hubs."", 'The company signed a first-of-its-kind carbon dioxide transportation agreement with ExxonMobil in 2022. Exxon initially reserved the capacity to transport 3.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide on EnLink pipelines starting early next year. It could ultimately take up to 10 million tons of capacity.', 'EnLink is also in discussions with several other energy companies, including Occidental Petroleum, for carbon takeaway capacity. The company sees the potential to eventually transport nearly 90 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.', ""Carbon transportation could become a very lucrative business for EnLink. The company estimates it could generate an additional $300 million of annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) from this business in the coming years. That's a 25% increase from last year's level. It will require a minimal capital investment over the next five years to capture that earnings growth opportunity since it plans primarily to repurpose existing pipelines."", ""EnLink's growing cash flow from carbon transportation will give it more fuel to pay dividends. The midstream company recently increased its payment by 6%, pushing the yield over 4.5%. It could grow its payout even faster in the future as it starts capturing carbon cash flows."", 'Neha Chamaria (Enterprise Products Partners): Warren Buffett has always loved boring companies as long as they generate steady cash flows. He loves dividends, too. Enterprise Products Partners offers both -- stability in cash flows and dividend growth -- thanks to its midstream energy infrastructure business, which earns fees under long-term contracts.', ""There's much to like about Enterprise Products Partners, and many of those factors check Buffett's list. Enterprise Products is one of the largest midstream energy companies in the U.S., with a pipeline system spanning more than 50,000 miles. That gives the company a wide moat in the industry. It was also the fifth-largest producer in the Permian Basin in terms of Q2 2023 production, right after Occidental Petroleum.\xa0Meanwhile, Enterprise Products also operates the world's largest ethylene export terminal, giving it an edge over rivals."", ""Enterprise Products' balance sheet is also among the strongest in the industry, with ample liquidity, manageable debt, and the highest credit rating in the midstream energy space. Over the last 10 years, the company has generated an average return on invested capital (ROIC) of 12%, indicating management's efficiency in spending capital on high-return projects."", ""In yet more evidence of efficient capital allocation, consider that Enterprise Products' cash flows have grown steadily in the past decade. It also increased its dividend for the 25th consecutive year in 2023."", 'All of these combined have driven strong returns for shareholders in Enterprise Products over the years, with dividends playing the biggest role in those returns. So, with dividends reinvested, Enterprise Products stock generated nearly 42% returns for shareholders in the past five years.', ""Occidental stock, on the other hand, eroded investors' money as it lost around 6% of its value during the period. With its 7.5% yield, Enterprise Products remains a top energy stock to own."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Chevron wasn't one of them.

We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.”', 'Top Stock Pick: Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI)', 'Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones \xa0founded Tudor Investment Corporation\xa0in 1980. As of the end of the September quarter the hedge fund had a portfolio worth about over $9 billion.', ""The biggest stake of the company was in Activision Blizzard which is now going under the ownership of Microsoft.

Apple is the largest company in the world and produces terrific products that engage users for hours each day. Despite the company’s size, ubiquity and relevance, however, Apple’s growth has slowed dramatically. Its fiscal 2023 earnings were flat with those of 2022. Apple trades at 30x earnings; sustaining that multiple will require a meaningful acceleration in revenues. While such an improvement is possible, we do not see any obvious catalysts for adding tens of billions of dollars to Apple’s topline. Consequently, the risk-reward skews negatively.”', 'Top Stock Pick: Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)', ""Ray Dalio in 1975 founded\xa0Bridgewater Associates\xa0which went on to become the largest hedge fund in the world. According to Forbes, the hedge fund has over $124 billion in assets under management.

Even in the US, Coca-Cola trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\xa0The Procter & Gamble Company\xa0(NYSE:PG) is likewise at ~27x P/E, with earnings only ~12% higher than a decade ago (or a ~1% annual growth rate). This equates to a mere 3.3% – 3.7% earnings yield.', 'Both of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.', 'I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price.', 'But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.', 'Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”', 'Top Stock Pick: Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)', ""Having worked under legendary investor Julian Robertson, Chase Coleman rose to higher ranks in the money management industry with speed thanks to Robertson giving Coleman about $25 million after he shuttered his own fund Tiger Management.

If I had to boil it down to one phrase, it would be permanent relevance. A bold claim but I believe there’s much validity to it.', 'First and foremost, advanced medicine stocks help improve the human condition. Nobody in their last moments wished they had spent more time in the office. Instead, they regret that they didn’t spend enough time with their loved ones. And if we’re being perfectly honest, the innovations undergirding the top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies help give us more time.', 'Second, a clear economic directive catalyzes healthcare stocks. According to one assessment, the direct healthcare costs associated with managing illness and disease come out to $4.3 trillion annually. However, we must also consider the indirect expenses – lost labor income, lost productivity to early mortality and the loss to society – that serious conditions impose.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'I’m not going to say that all medicine stocks exist for the right reasons. Obviously, shady dealings can affect any industry. That said, for investors seeking profits by doing good, these healthcare stocks present compelling arguments.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top biomedical companies in the world, Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) manufactures medical devices used in interventional medical specialties. Given its tremendous relevance, it’s one of the more consistent healthcare stocks. In the past 52 weeks, BSX gained nearly 28% of equity value. As well, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a max price target of $77.', 'A major focus area for Boston is interventional radiology. This is a medical specialty that performs various minimally invasive procedures using medical imaging guidance. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global interventional radiology market reached a valuation of approximately $25.46 billion last year. Further, experts project that the segment will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% to 2028.', 'At the culmination point, the segment could be worth $33.92 billion. That’s a good reason to put it on your radar of healthcare stocks. Now, BSX isn’t priced at a discount, considering its trailing-year earnings multiple of 72.7X. That said, it has strong operating margins, making it a worthwhile idea.', 'Source: Dmytro Zinkevych / Shutterstock.com', 'To be upfront, Globus Medical (NYSE:GMED) currently stands as one of the riskiest healthcare stocks. In the past 52 weeks, GMED gave up almost 24% of equity value. However, it’s been on the move recently, gaining over 17% in the trailing month. So, the specialist in the field of musculoskeletal disorders is worth a look for speculators. Analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $64.08 average price target.', 'Fundamentally, Globus will appeal to forward-thinking investors thanks to its revolutionary robotic navigation platform. Through its rigid robotic arm combined with full navigation capabilities, Globus offers a single adaptable platform for accurate alignment in spine surgery. Notably, Strategic Market Research states that the global spinal implants and surgery devices market size reached a valuation of $11.42 billion in 2021. By 2030, the segment could be worth over $18 billion, a CAGR of 5.23%.', 'When you add in the robotics component, Globus could be an attractive play for the broader field of medicine stocks. Enticingly, GMED trades at a forward earnings multiple of 20X, under the sector median of 24.64X.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Another risky but compelling idea for innovative healthcare stocks, iRhythm Technologies (NASDAQ:IRTC) gained 6% of equity value in the past 52 weeks. However, it was a choppy ride to get to that modest performance. Still, recent momentum is encouraging. Also, analysts are looking at the long-term picture, rating IRTC a unanimous strong buy. And that’s among 10 analysts to be clear. The average price target lands at $126.40.', 'So, why is Wall Street enamored with iRhythm? Likely, it has to do with its wearable, AI-powered electrocardiogram (ECG) system. By providing a continuous heart monitor that can be worn for up to 14 days, iRhythm is redefining the way cardiac arrhythmias are diagnosed. And that’s crucial because the system may help prevent sudden cardiac death.', 'According to the National Institutes of Health, an estimated 180,000 to 300,000 sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) occur in the U.S. annually. Worldwide, this condition represents the most common cause of death. Therefore, IRTC is easily one of the most relevant healthcare stocks, though investors should be aware of some financial challenges.', 'Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'A company that needs no introduction thanks to the Covid-19 crisis, telehealth specialist Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) soared to prominence in 2020. With the mysterious SARS-CoV-2 virus running around, no one wanted to be around strangers. Therefore, the underlying telehealth platform made much sense. However, with the fading of the pandemic, TDOC cratered from its prior highs. In the past 52 weeks, it lost 20% of value.', 'Still, not all analysts are giving up. True, TDOC is barely hanging onto its moderate buy assessment, which breaks down as six buys and 11 holds. Still, a buy is a buy. Further, it’s not an unreasonable opinion. According to Grand View Research, the global telehealth market size reached a valuation of $101.2 billion last year. Further, the segment may expand at a CAGR of 24.3% to 2030, printing annual revenue of $455.3 billion.', 'To be fair, the financials present a bit of an issue. For example, investment data aggregator Gurufocus warns that TDOC may be a possible value trap. Nevertheless, if you believe in the narrative – that people are more comfortable in their own homes rather than in a clinical setting – TDOC could be worth a look.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top names under the broader medicine stocks category during the Covid-19 crisis, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) practically became a household name for developing a vaccine for the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Not surprisingly, though, as fears of the pandemic faded, so too did MRNA. In the trailing 52 weeks, the stock lost 43% of equity value, a staggering figure.', 'Nevertheless, Moderna enjoys support among Wall Street analysts, who rate shares a moderate buy. For full disclosure, it’s a contested assessment, breaking down as eight buys, six holds and two sells. However, the average price target of $129.75 – implying over 21% upside potential – is encouraging. So too is the underlying relevance.', 'By leveraging its acumen from messenger-RNA-based vaccines, Moderna has partnered with Merck (NYSE:MRK) to develop an experimental mRNA cancer vaccine. According to a Reuters report last month, the vaccine cut the chance of recurrence or death from melanoma by half after three years. That’s a major win, obviously.', 'While shares represent a big risk given the steep losses, patient speculators may want to look into it. At the least, it has the potential to be a surprisingly robust example of healthcare stocks.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'A compelling and simultaneously controversial idea, Crispr Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) represents one of the first companies to utilize the CRISPR gene-editing platform to develop medicines for the treatment of various rare and common diseases. As a result, it’s one of the most-talked-about medicine stocks. Sure enough, analysts did it too, pegging it a moderate buy with a $87.26 price target. That comes out to almost 35% upside potential.', 'But can it get there? Unfortunately, I don’t have a crystal ball. And I don’t like to rely on a company’s own assessments because let’s face it: they’re all going to talk themselves up. However, Precedence Research states that the global gene-editing market reached a valuation of $6.94 billion in 2022. Further, experts believe that the segment could hit $29.93 billion by 2032.', 'If so, we’re talking about a CAGR of 15.73%. That seems exciting but the problem is that Crispr represents largely a narrative play. For example, its revenue generation is sporadic so it’s difficult to pin down. However, the combination of Crispr’s scientific relevance and projected industry growth makes it one of the compelling healthcare stocks for speculators.', 'Source: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.com', 'Several years ago, the ice bucket challenge to raise awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) sprouted to much success. It wasn’t just about standing with people who suffer from the disease. Rather, it moved the needle to address it. One of the potential treatments that the ALS Association – which benefitted from the raised funds tied to the ice bucket phenomenon – helped fund was AMX0035.', 'The company forwarding the therapeutic was Amylyx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AMLX). What started as an idea in a dorm room at Brown University became one of the top therapeutics to fight ALS. Further, AMX0035 – now known as Relyvrio – received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2022. As a result, AMLX holds much promise, earning a unanimous strong buy view among Wall Street analysts.', 'To be fair, AMLX may be the riskiest idea on this list of advanced healthcare stocks. In the past 52 weeks, it lost more than 56% of equity value.

As is the case with many healthcare-centric businesses, the fact that Regeneron develops medicines that are essential and even lifesaving for patients lends it considerable resilience in a wide range of market environments.', ""Case in point: Over the trailing five-year period, Regeneron has seen its annual revenue climb by close to 86%, while annual profits have jumped 105% in that same time frame.

They want to win. In the same vein, most investors don't buy stocks just because they like a company's products. They want to make money."", 'Making money is a lot easier when you invest in companies with strong underlying businesses and exceptional growth prospects. Here are three unstoppable growth stocks that could make you richer in 2024.', ""Owning shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2023 would have made you plenty of money. The stock soared by nearly 81%. I think that Amazon's impressive momentum can continue this year."", ""One reason behind Amazon's sizzling gains last year was its improving profitability. The company's earnings skyrocketed by more than 240% year over year in the third quarter. This impressive jump was due in large part to Amazon's focus on streamlining its operations to boost profits. I expect those efforts will continue to pay off in the coming quarters."", ""The surge in interest in generative AI stood out as another major tailwind for Amazon in 2023. Don't think this AI boom will be only temporary. I predict that Amazon will benefit from it in all areas of its operations for years to come."", 'In particular, more organizations are likely to move their apps and data to the cloud to harness the power of generative AI. This should work to the advantage of Amazon Web Services, which ranks as the leading cloud services provider based on market share.', 'MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is sometimes referred to as the ""Amazon of Latin America."" There\'s certainly a similarity in the two stocks\' trajectories: Shares of MercadoLibre vaulted nearly 86% higher last year.', 'MercadoLibre runs a huge e-commerce platform that operates in 18 Latin American countries. This platform ranks as the market leader based on unique visitors and page views in every major country in the region.', 'The company is also the leader in fintech in Latin America with its Mercado Pago business unit. This is a major growth market for MercadoLibre, as evidenced by total payment volume in online payments soaring by triple digits in 2023 Q3.', ""I'm optimistic about MercadoLibre's newer ventures as well. The company's credit card total payment volume recently topped $1 billion for the first time. It also launched Mercado Play, an advertising-supported streaming service. MercadoLibre's short video platform, Clips, is gaining momentum. Overall, this business and stock appear to be unstoppable."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) was the worst performer of these three stocks in 2023. However, that's not anything to be ashamed of considering that the biotech stock rose by 41% last year after delivering a 31.5% gain in 2022. I feel good about Vertex's prospects this year, too."", ""Just days ago, the company picked up its second U.S. regulatory approval for Casgevy. The gene-editing therapy now has the green light to be used to treat both sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. It will take a while for Casgevy's revenue to ramp up, but Goldman Sachs projects peak annual sales of $3.9 billion."", 'Two other new products could be on the way soon. Vertex hopes to move forward with regulatory filings for its non-opioid pain drug candidate VX-548 and a cystic fibrosis combination therapy featuring vanzacaftor, tezacaftor, and deutivacaftor. Both could be blockbusters if approved.', ""In the meantime, sales for Vertex's current cystic fibrosis franchise should continue to grow. The company's goal is to also launch yet another new drug in the not-too-distant future -- inaxaplin, as a treatment for APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). This could open up a huge new market for Vertex. AMKD affects more patients worldwide than cystic fibrosis. If approved, inaxaplin would be the first therapy to treat the underlying cause of the disease."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them.

My love of Coca-Cola really got going after I visited the World of Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta in the 1990s. There I was exposed to the iconic red and white memorabilia more than ever before."", ""That legendary Coca-Cola branding is reportedly recognizable to 94% of the world's population. For perspective, more people recognize the Coke branding than have running water\xa0-- it's almost incomprehensible the reach this business has."", ""Coca-Cola is a beloved brand and it's also a beloved stock. Investors can't track the top holdings on Robinhood Markets anymore. But back when you could, Coca-Cola stock was regularly within the top 100 most-held stocks on the platform, counterintuitively right next to a plethora of meme stocks."", ""The popularity of Coca-Cola stock is surprising to me. Over the last decade, it's been a below-average performer when compared to the S&P 500 and it's not even close."", ""It seems that Coca-Cola is so well-known that people want to invest, assuming it will be a good performer. However, buying the KO stock symbol isn't the only way to invest in Coca-Cola. In fact, there's more than one Coke stock and some investors have ridden one of the others to market-crushing gains."", ""Coca-Cola partners with over 200 independent bottlers around the world to produce its beverages. One of these is Coca-Cola Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE). This bottling company is Coca-Cola's largest partner in the U.S. But Coca-Cola Consolidated also partners with Keurig Dr Pepper and Monster Beverage to distribute some of their products."", ""Coca-Cola Consolidated stock has been a better investment than Coca-Cola by a mile. And the 10-year chart below shows steady gains throughout the decade, suggesting its performance isn't just a fluke -- something positive is happening here."", ""The performance of Coca-Cola Consolidated stock appears to be the direct result of operational excellence. The company has grown revenue by gaining control over more distribution territories. And by investing in its business, it's simultaneously recognized cost savings, resulting in big profit gains."", 'Indeed, the chart below shows that the gains for Coca-Cola Consolidated stock match its gains in operating income. In other words, the stock is up in proportion to its profit growth, which is exactly what one would expect over the long haul.', 'In my view, Coca-Cola Consolidated stock is clearly a better buy today compared to Coca-Cola stock. Its operating margin is currently 13.1%. For comparison, it was below 10% just a couple of years ago. The company has worked hard to improve its profitability, and management believes it can sustain its improvements. In short, investors can likely expect a high level of profitability going forward.', ""The increased profitability is doing wonders for Coca-Cola Consolidated's balance sheet. For the first time in 40 years, it has more cash than debt."", ""Moreover, Coca-Cola Consolidated stock is cheap compared to its profits. As of this writing, it has a market capitalization of $8.4 billion but it's generated $712 million in trailing-12-month operating income. Relatively speaking, that's a lot of profit compared to the value of the company and it positions the stock well for gains."", ""Coca-Cola Consolidated pays a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, which looks laughably low considering its stock price is over $900 per share. However, the company has paid a special dividend two years in a row, including last year's special payout of $16 per share."", 'Therefore, Coca-Cola Consolidated does look to reward its shareholders. And as its profits continue pouring in during coming years, I would expect that to continue.', ""To be fair, Coca-Cola Consolidated's growth could be somewhat limited because there are only so many distribution regions to control. And there are limits to how high it can push its operating margin. So investors shouldn't expect profit growth like what it's experienced in recent years."", 'However, Coca-Cola Consolidated stock is cheap and it has options when it comes to returning cash to shareholders. Therefore, I believe this stock could make up a solid part of a portfolio of stocks.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola Consolidated right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola Consolidated, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola Consolidated wasn't one of them.

The stock returned 3,787,464% from 1965 through 2022. That's more than 150 times the 24,708% return from the S&P 500 index over the same period."", ""Contributing to those returns was the growing value of Berkshire's stock holdings -- a portfolio worth $318 billion at the end of 2023's third quarter. One common theme among its largest stock holdings is that those stocks own strong brands and pay regular dividends."", ""Buffett acknowledged in last year's shareholder letter that stakes in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and American Express (NYSE: AXP), which Berkshire Hathaway has held for decades, have provided it with billions of dollars in unrealized gains from share price appreciation that was partially powered by their growing dividends."", 'These two stakes, along with its massive stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), are set to provide the conglomerate with nearly $2 billion in dividend income over the next year.', ""Coca-Cola is the longest-held position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. In his 2023 shareholder letter, Buffett noted that in 1994, Berkshire completed its multiyear investment in the company -- spending a total of $1.3 billion on what are now (after a pair of 2-for-1 splits in the years that followed) the 400 million shares it still owns. It paid an average of $3.25 per split-adjusted share for that stake. That position is currently worth $24 billion and provides Berkshire Hathaway with annual dividend income of $736 million -- 56% of its original cost basis."", ""Coca-Cola has increased its payouts for 62 consecutive years, and Buffett expects the streak to continue. If Coke raises its quarterly dividend payment by $0.02 per share in 2024 (a level consistent with its boosts in the last two years), Berkshire's dividend check will increase another $8 million to $744 million over the next year."", ""Coke-branded products make up only a third of the company's annual unit case sales volume. The diversity of its brand portfolio, which includes juices, water, and teas, allows the company to market multiple beverages for different occasions and smooth out sales across geographies. Latin America has been one of the company's fastest-growing regions, posting double-digit percentage sales growth last quarter, which offset weaker results elsewhere."", 'Another important reason to expect Coca-Cola to remain a solid income investment is its ability to adapt to shifting consumer preferences. Coke generated nearly a third of its sales volume in 2022 from no-sugar and low-calorie products. Its success with products like Coke Zero fuels its ongoing solid results; non-GAAP (adjusted) revenue was up 11% year over year in the third quarter.', ""Making syrups from concentrate doesn't require a lot of capital. Coca-Cola has a globally recognizable brand and a profitable business model to keep sales, earnings, and dividends growing. Last year, it distributed 72% of its earnings via dividends. Its current yield is 3.05%."", 'Berkshire Hathaway has owned a stake in American Express for almost as long as it has held one in Coca-Cola. The cost basis on that investment was nearly $1.3 billion, or $8.49 per share.', ""Based on American Express' current quarterly payout of $0.60 per share, Berkshire will take in nearly $364 million in dividend income from the financial giant over the next year. At its current share price, Amex's yield is a below-average 1.32%, but it also has a low payout ratio of 21% and is growing profits at double-digit percentage rates that could support further increases in the payout."", 'American Express has similar advantages to those of Coca-Cola, such as strong brand power and a large customer base. At the end of 2022, it had over 76 million Amex cards in force worldwide and another 56 million cards issued by third-party brands.', ""Delta Air Lines is one third-party brand that is a valuable partner for American Express. Delta offers Amex card members travel-related perks, including airport lounge access and other services. It's these benefits, along with membership rewards and exclusive discounts at top retailers, that have built American Express into a desirable card for high-income shoppers."", 'A key advantage for American Express is that its average cardholder spends more on average than the users of other credit cards. The main advantage of this is that it gives American Express leverage with merchants in terms of setting its processing fees.', ""A high-spending membership base is also beneficial during occasional weakness in consumer spending broadly. The soft retail spending environment over the last few years hasn't hurt American Express, which reported record revenue in 2022 and continued to post solid results in 2023. Revenue net of interest expense grew 13% year over year in 2023's third quarter, while earnings jumped 34%."", 'The combination of a strong brand, customer loyalty, and a large network of merchant partners explains why Buffett has held this stock for so long and why he expects the dividend to keep growing.', ""Berkshire Hathaway first bought shares of Apple in 2016. After further share purchases and a 378% increase in Apple's stock price over the last five years, that stake is now worth about $167 billion. It is the largest investment Berkshire Hathaway has ever made in a single stock, and the annual dividend payout should also grow into a sizable amount over the long term."", 'Assuming Berkshire continues to hold 915 million shares of Apple, that stake will provide it with $878 million in dividend income over the next 12 months.', ""Apple has tremendous cash resources that it can invest in technology, but it's the company's brand that Buffett values the most. In terms of its products' technological features, Apple has often lagged its competitors. And yet, Apple remarkably still sells millions of iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches every year. The iPhone is the biggest draw, bringing in $200 billion in annual revenue."", ""Apple's customers are drawn to the experience of the software behind these devices, where content is seamlessly tied together through its iCloud service. This is the heart of Apple's competitive advantage over Samsung and other smartphone rivals. While Apple controls less than 20% of the global smartphone market, it generates over 80% of the industry's profits."", ""A lucrative business model provides Apple with an enormous edge in finances. It held $57 billion of net cash as of the end of September, but management is working to bring that down to a neutral cash position through dividends and share repurchases. Making the task more challenging is that a massive amount of profits floods into the company's coffers every year. In other words, Apple has more cash than it knows what to do with."", ""Apple is now producing $99 billion in trailing free cash flow, which could fund a growing dividend and pave the way for new products and services that widen the company's economic moat. The upcoming Vision Pro mixed-reality headset might take a while to catch on with customers given its $3,499 price tag, but it shows Apple is not going to rely solely on its existing product lineup to drive long-term growth."", ""Like American Express, Apple also has a below-average yield, but what investors give up in yield, they make up for with dividend growth and share price appreciation. The company has more than doubled its payout over the last 10 years and boosted its share price by 873%. Given its low 15% payout ratio, Apple's dividend should grow for many years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

It's impossible to predict with 100% certainty what the market will do this year, but there is reason to be optimistic about what's ahead. That's because history shows us bear markets always lead to better market times, and those times of strength -- bull markets -- last longer than times of weakness."", ""In any case, there's a type of stock that could offer great rewards no matter what the market is doing. I'm talking about dividend stocks, which pay you passive income each year just for owning them. In bull markets, you'll often benefit from these stocks' market performance and the extra income -- and in more difficult times, the dividend payments alone could bolster your portfolio. Here are my five top dividend stocks to buy hand over fist in 2024."", ""Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), as a Dividend King, has lifted its payment for more than 50 consecutive years. This track record shows rewarding shareholders is important to the company, so it's reasonable to expect the policy to continue."", 'J&J pays a dividend of $4.76 per share, representing a yield of 2.95%, surpassing that of the S&P 500. And the healthcare giant, generating more than $15 billion in free cash flow, has what it takes to financially support dividend increases.', 'Importantly, even more growth may be right around the corner for this company. Last year, J&J spun off its slower growth consumer health business to focus on its higher growth pharmaceuticals and medtech businesses. The company predicts it will launch 20 new drugs and 50 expansions of current products by 2030. And one-third of medtech sales will come from new products by 2027. So, buying J&J shares now could offer you a great combination of safety -- thanks to dividends -- and growth.', 'Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) also makes the list of Dividend Kings after its many decades of dividend growth. The company pays $1.84 per share at a yield of 3.06%, like J&J, surpassing the yield of the S&P 500.', ""The world's biggest non-alcoholic beverage maker's cash dividend payout ratio shows it pays out 76% of free cash flow as dividends. And the company's rising free cash flow indicates this clearly is sustainable."", ""What drives this cash flow growth is Coca-Cola's high-quality business, selling its eponymous beverage and many other top brands -- from Dasani water to Minute Maid juices -- that keep customers coming back. Coca-Cola's solid moat, or competitive advantage, is this brand strength, and it helped the company continue to increase earnings even as higher inflation weighed on the consumer's buying power last year."", 'So, you can count Coca-Cola to progressively grow earnings and dividends almost regardless of the economic environment, making it a top stock to buy and hold for the long term.', 'I like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) for its long history of dividend growth -- meet yet another Dividend King -- as well as its diversified healthcare business.', ""Let's talk dividend first. Abbott pays a dividend of $2.20 per share at a yield of 1.93%, surpassing the yield of the S&P 500, and like the companies I've mentioned above, Abbott has the solid free cash flow to sustain dividend growth. So, when you buy this stock, you can imagine your passive income increasing year after year."", ""As for Abbott's business, the company includes four units: medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition, and established pharmaceuticals. The charm of this is if one faces a particular headwind, the others can compensate -- this has happened with diagnostics, as the company's covid tests went from soaring to declining revenue. In the recent quarter, excluding the negative impact of covid tests, Abbott's sales rose more than 13% to $10 billion -- and all four businesses posted double-digit gains."", ""So, using Abbott's historical performance as a guide, you can count on steady earnings growth as you collect more and more passive income year after year."", 'AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) made its debut back in 2013 when Abbott spun off its pharmaceuticals business, and since, the new company has increased its dividend 285%. Today, AbbVie pays a dividend of $6.20 per share, at a yield of 3.80%.', ""In the most recent earnings call, AbbVie said dividend growth remained a priority, even today as it goes through a significant transition. AbbVie's top-selling drug Humira faces biosimilar competition, and that equals declining revenue. But the company has groomed two newer immunology drugs -- Rinvoq and Skyrizi -- to take over and together surpass Humira's peak revenue by the end of the decade."", 'Rinvoq and Skyrizi, heading for $11.6 billion in sales for the full year 2023, are on the right path. On top of this, AbbVie also has a full portfolio of other major drugs in areas including neurosciene and aesthetics, and a promising pipeline too.', 'All of this means the stock could deliver increasing growth -- and dividends -- as AbbVie approaches its goals.', ""Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) is another company involved in a transition phase that's set to lead to increasing growth. The medical device giant has taken steps to become more efficient, divest slow-growth businesses, and invest in growth areas such as artificial intelligence (AI)."", ""At the same time, Medtronic has committed to making dividend growth a priority. In the company's most recent earnings report, it said it aims to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders each year. In the 2023 fiscal year, it returned $4 billion, or 86% of free cash flow, in the form of dividends and share repurchases."", ""Medtronic pays a dividend of 2.76, at a yield of 3.20%, and has increased its payouts for more than 45 years. Considering its prioritization of dividend growth, its steps to boost earnings, and the fact that it's very close to becoming a Dividend King, this company makes a top dividend stock to buy hand over fist this year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Johnson & Johnson wasn't one of them.

And this is precisely why Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate headed by Warren Buffett, has owned shares in the company since 1988.', ""The Oracle of Omaha certainly likes Coca-Cola's durability as a business. And that helps explain why the beverage stock currently makes up under 7% of Berkshire's equities portfolio. It's the fourth-largest holding behind Apple, Bank of America, and American Express."", ""Perhaps the most important reason Buffett still loves Coca-Cola is because of the huge amounts of passive income that it spits out. Let's take a closer look."", ""Berkshire currently owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola. This means that on an annualized basis, Warren Buffett's company generates $736 million in dividend income from the beverage giant. That is a huge passive income stream that likely explains why Buffett isn't exiting the position."", 'Coca-Cola has long focused on returning capital to shareholders through these payouts, which now sit at $0.46 per share each quarter. The business has raised dividends in 61 straight years, easily making it one of the best companies in this regard. ', ""It's not difficult to find reasons to appreciate Coca-Cola's business. For starters, this is an incredibly profitable enterprise. In the last 10 years, the company's operating margin averaged a stellar 25.9%. And through the first nine months of 2023, Coca-Cola generated $7.9 billion of free cash flow, which directly helps to fund dividend payments."", 'And as noted, the company has one of the strongest brands around. This helps it maintain top consumer mindshare across the world, reducing the chances of Coca-Cola ever being disrupted from the position it has in the industry.', ""This has created a scenario in which the company can flex its pricing power, which might be the characteristic Buffett appreciates the most. In the most recent quarter, Coca-Cola's net revenue increased by 8% year over year, driven primarily by pricing increases. This proves that consumers aren't going to switch to competing brands to save some money. "", 'That adds to the stability of this company to continue producing healthy financial results no matter what the macroeconomic environment looks like. The fact that Coca-Cola is a mature, stable operation means there is really no chance that the dividend is ever in trouble of being eliminated. Moreover, the business is in a position to keep raising the payouts in the decades ahead.', ""Just because Warren Buffett, arguably the greatest investor ever, has a sizable stake in Coca-Cola doesn't automatically mean that you should too, even if the valuation is below the stock's trailing-five-year average. As of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.3. "", ""But before rushing to buy the stock, consider Coca-Cola's growth potential. In the last 10 years, from Q3 2013 to Q3 2023, sales were flat. To be clear, this is a low-growth business, which might turn off some investors.

They can be the bedrock of true generational wealth. So, what types of stocks fit that bill? Well, let's have a look at three that I consider forever stocks."", 'Tech giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a mainstay of my investment portfolio and will remain so for many years to come, for three key reasons.', 'Relentless focus on the customer: This was the creed of founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, and it still permeates the company today. Look no further than the company\'s mission statement: ""Amazon\'s mission is to be Earth\'s most customer-centric company.""', 'Innovation: Amazon has developed numerous innovations, ranging from its sprawling fulfillment network to its vast array of data centers that make it the global leader in cloud computing services.', 'Delivering shareholder value: The company constantly reevaluates its finances and workforce, with a focus on balancing shareholder returns and reinvestment in the business. Over the last 10 years, Amazon shares have returned 659%, meaning a $10,000 investment in early 2014 would be worth nearly $76,000 as of this writing.', 'AMZN Total Return Level data by YCharts.', ""In short, Amazon is a great company. What's more, with analysts expecting it to grow sales by 11% this year as its long-term investments in regional distribution combine with a rebound in enterprise cloud spending."", 'Next up is Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), the legendary maker of iconic beverage brands such as Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Fanta, Schweppes, and Minute Maid, among many others.', 'The reason I intend to own Coca-Cola stock forever is that the company delivers consistent earnings growth. Over the last five years, Coca-Cola has grown its net income from $6.7 billion to $10.8 billion. Quarterly earnings per share (EPS) have increased at an average rate of 19%. Moreover, free cash flow -- the lifeblood of a mature, dividend-paying company -- has grown from $6.0 billion to more than $10.2 billion. ', 'That, in turn, has allowed Coca-Cola to increase its dividend consistently. In fact, the company has raised its dividend each year, dating back 62 years -- representing one of the longest such streaks on Wall Street.', ""And what a dividend it is! The company pays $1.84 per share -- good for a dividend yield of 3.1% at the current share price. That's more than twice the 1.4% average yield of the S&P 500 index."", 'To see how important those dividend payments are over the long term, consider this chart which shows the growth of a $10,000 investment in Coca-Cola over the last 30 years.', ""The company's steadily growing payouts make an enormous difference, boosting the total return of the investment from $56,000 to more than $116,000 (with dividend reinvestment)."", 'In short, Coca-Cola remains a solid stock that investors can rely on for the very long-term -- a nearly perfect forever stock.', ""Finally, there's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The reason to own Nvidia forever is simple: Technology is the future. "", ""Never has this been more obvious than right now. Whether it's artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving, advanced robotics, or gene editing, it's clear that the next wave of technological breakthroughs will have one thing in common: They will require tremendous amounts of computing power."", 'That means demand for advanced semiconductors -- the type used in the supercomputers and server farms of today and tomorrow -- will continue to grow massively in the years to come.', 'Nvidia, which many experts believe makes the best and fastest chips for high-performance computing, stands to benefit enormously from the rise of AI and other cutting-edge tech innovations.', ""That's why Wall Street analysts are raising their forecasts for its future sales at a breakneck pace. The consensus among analysts is that Nvidia will report over $92 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2025. Over the last 12 months, it reported $45 billion in revenues."", ""Nevertheless, Nvidia isn't a perfect forever stock for everyone. Income-seeking investors will be better off looking elsewhere, as will value-oriented investors and those who lack the stomach for stocks with high volatility."", 'However, for long-term investors who a ready to hold on through the inevitable volatility, Nvidia is a forever stock with a high ceiling, and one worth seriously considering.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The company's products are available in more than 200 countries and territories."", 'Through Berkshire Hathaway, famous investor Warren Buffett has long been a Coca-Cola shareholder. But where will this top beverage stock be in five years? The answer might surprise you.', ""With $45 billion in trailing-12-month sales, Coca-Cola commands a leading share (roughly 44%) of the global market for nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. If we look out to 2029, there is almost zero chance that the company's dominant industry position will be affected. "", ""Coca-Cola's management team says that the business owns 26 different brands that generate at least $1 billion in annual revenue. This highlights just how much of a stranglehold it has on this part of the economy."", ""The key to the company's success is its strong brand recognition, which makes up Coca-Cola's economic moat. This is exemplified by its superior gross margin, which has averaged 59.7% in the last five years.\xa0"", ""Besides the brand, another factor that insulates the company from the threat of disruption is that this is a boring industry. Coca-Cola doesn't operate in the tech sector, which every year attracts tons of fresh capital and entrepreneurs looking to challenge the status quo. The beverage industry is pretty stable."", 'Coca-Cola operates in an extremely mature industry, with limited growth prospects and minimal opportunities to invest capital back into the business. Typically, companies in this situation generate outsize cash profits. And that is definitely the case here.', 'The business produced $7.9 billion in free cash flow through the first three quarters of 2023. And this will continue allowing the management team to return capital to shareholders. Combined, Coca-Cola spent $5.3 billion on dividends and buybacks in the last nine months, which boosts shareholder returns.', ""While neither the gross margin nor the operating margin has demonstrated an ability to expand in recent years, what is encouraging is just how consistent they've been. This was despite a global pandemic, supply chain bottlenecks, and ongoing economic uncertainty. This steadiness bodes well for Coca-Cola's future profitability."", ""Over the past five years, a $1,000 investment in Coca-Cola would be worth under $1,500 today, including dividends. For comparison's sake, the same cash outlay in an S&P 500 index fund would be worth almost $2,000. If we look back 10 years, it's the same story. "", ""There's no reason to believe that this type of performance won't continue. Investors hoping that this leading beverage business will outperform the overall market over the next five years should seriously temper their expectations. I just don't see this playing out, given the stock's historical track record."", 'However, anyone interested in adding a mature and stable Dividend King to their portfolio should take a closer look at Coca-Cola.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$2.21b', 'US$3.00b', 'US$3.51b', 'US$3.89b', 'US$4.18b', 'US$4.40b', 'US$4.60b', 'US$4.77b', 'US$4.92b', 'US$5.07b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x11', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 5.28%', 'Est @ 4.36%', 'Est @ 3.72%', 'Est @ 3.27%', 'Est @ 2.96%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% ', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.6k', 'US$2.9k', 'US$3.0k', 'US$3.0k', 'US$2.9k', 'US$2.8k', 'US$2.8k', 'US$2.7k', 'US$2.6k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$27b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.2%) = US$107b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$107b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$54b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$81b.

Compared to the current share price of US$184, the company appears about fair value at a 8.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.970. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The main reason for the growth in the water treatment market is the depletion of freshwater resources, which is worrisome on a global level. Therefore, the market has adopted new trends and techniques to better manage and treat wastewater.\xa0', 'Digitalization is one of the most significant trends adopted in the wastewater treatment industry. With increasing global water demand and the need to develop infrastructure, digital water management has become a crucial part of the water treatment industry.

In our houses, a leaked toilet alone can waste around 15,000 gallons of water a month. Water may be a commodity that we don’t think much of while using, but it’s essential for our existence.

This question is rarely posed anymore since data has overwhelmingly proved that investing in the stock markets is one of the best ways to increase your wealth over time. A report in October 2023 by the Wall Street Journal talked about the rise of ""mini-millionaires"" and how the average wealth of American families was increasing, citing data from the Federal Reserve. Mini-millionaires usually make about $150,000 and $250,000 a year. The report said between 2019 and 2022 families in the 80th to 90th percentile of the income distribution saw the biggest rise in their incomes as their median wealth increased by about 69% from 2019 through 2022, adjusted for inflation.', 'The report said that over 90% of these families reported owning stocks, either directly or indirectly.', ""Needless to say, investing in the stock market is full of crevices. You can't expect to get rich investing in low-quality stocks and random companies with no value. Investing in stocks to become rich involves patience, wise choices and sticking to traditional investing principles. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had in 2000 foreseen the changing trends in the stock market where investors were becoming impatient, expecting to make money without paying attention to the actual fundamentals of companies. But Klarman at the time had also predicted the return of traditional methods of evaluating companies before investing. In his letter to investors Klarman had said:"", '""If Paul Harvey\'s serialized radio program ""The Rest of the Story"" were applied to Wall Street, it would describe the sad denouement of many such ""story"" stocks. The unraveling of the virtuous circle of growth is not pretty, with earnings shortfalls, plunging share prices, employees with under-water options jumping ship, overzealous shareholders receiving margin calls, accounting chicanery exposed, lawsuits filed, and, to come full circle, the final insult of deletion from the relevant major market index. At this time, attractive valuation is not considered a good story. A slow growth or no growth company trading at one half or one third of its underlying value attracts no important constituency of investors. I sometimes joke about the new market valuation rules of thumb: stocks that fail to meet earnings expectations all seem to trade at 10 times reduced earnings, while formerly profitable companies that report losses all seem to trade at five dollars per share. Many investors avoid these stocks precisely because others are staying away. Why would those kind of stocks ever go up, they wonder. Even those of us with value investing in our DNA generally prefer situations with catalysts for the realization of underlying value.', 'Over time, this will change. At some unknowable future point, the undervaluation of small capitalization stocks lacking exciting growth characteristics will become so gaping that investors will once again be attracted. The point of investing, after all, is not to have a great story to tell; the point of investing is to make money with limited risk. At some point, investors will drop their Pulitzer prize winning story stocks and revisit their attention on the old classics, stocks that make you money because their undervaluation creates a compelling imbalance between risk and return.""', 'Seth Klarman of Baupost Group', 'Methodology', 'For this article we scoured various analyst reports and interviews to pick 11 stocks that experts believe can make one rich in the next 5-10 years.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 16', 'ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) is one of the stocks that can make one rich in the next few years according to Wall Street analysts.
