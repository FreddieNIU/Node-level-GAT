The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Microchip Technology's shares on or after the 19th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 5th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.38 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.53 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Microchip Technology stock has a trailing yield of around 2.1% on the current share price of $73.81. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Microchip Technology Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see Microchip Technology paying out a modest 31% of its earnings.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Microchip Technology has grown its earnings rapidly, up 49% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Microchip Technology has increased its dividend at approximately 8.1% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Microchip Technology? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Microchip Technology more closely.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Microchip Technology is facing.

U.S. climate envoy John Kerry says the time is here for the industry to prove it can make the technology happen — at scale, affordably and quickly — to stave off climate disaster.And Kerry says he has “serious questions” whether it can.Kerry's comments came in an interview with The Associated Press on one of the most crucial topics in the fight to slow global warming: the argument from oil and gas producers that they will soon have technology in place to extract the climate-damaging gases that make fossil fuels the main culprit in climate change, allowing companies to keep pumping crude and natural gas worry-free.Kerry said the ideal solution is a fast global switch to renewable energy, but oil and gas states and companies have a right to give their claim of technological rescue a try.“If you're able to abate the emissions, capture it,” Kerry said this past week at his climate team's offices at the State Department. “But we don't have that at-scale yet. And we can’t sit here and just pretend we’re going to automatically have something we don’t have today. Because we might not. It might not work.”Globally, the point matters because oil and gas companies point to the hope of technology that can one day scour away most of the climate-wrecking carbon to stave off public and government pressure for the world to pivot faster away from fossil fuels and to solar, wind and other cleaner energy.“What they’re banking on is that they’re going to be able to do the emissions capture,” Kerry said of oil and gas companies. He ticked off the stages of operations that would involve.“If you can do those things, you may be able to make it economically competitive,” he said, adding, “I have some serious questions about whether it will be price-competitive.”Story continuesEspecially since 2015, when the United States and nearly 200 other governments committed to cut emissions to avoid the most disastrous scenarios of global warming, oil producers have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in public campaigns portraying themselves as climate-friendly. Industry ads and social media campaigns often suggest the carbon-purging technology is already on the job, extracting the climate-damaging gases from oil and gas facilities' around the world.“CO2 capture and transportation technologies have been operating safely across the globe and in the US for many years,” the website of oil giant BP says.“Technologies capture CO2 emissions at source or directly from the air,” Saudi state oil giant Aramco says, describing the carbon then being stored safely underground or turned into “useful products.”In reality, the technology to capture one major climate-damaging gas, methane, from oil and gas operations does exist, and is awaiting investment to roll out at scale. But the technology to capture the biggest climate agent, carbon dioxide, remains limited in scale and costly, and often energy-intensive in its own right.The International Energy Agency, some national governments globally, and many climate scientists and advocates are adamant that while carbon-capturing technology will play a role, oil and gas production itself must be phased out.“Actual experience has been that commercial-scale carbon capture projects have fallen far, far short of the claims,” said David Schlissel of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis research group.“I just think it's foolish to think that we can keep pumping the stuff, CO2, methane, into the atmosphere, and that at some point we'll be able to capture it,” Schlissel said.The American Petroleum Institute trade group declined comment on whether the industry could show it was ready to bring carbon-capture technology fully online quickly enough and affordably enough.In a statement, the group said “API supports federal policies to achieve” commercial carbon capture efforts and bring them fully online. It pointed to a 2019 industry-backed report calling for heavy government funding to capture a quarter of current greenhouse gases within 15 years.The fight — fast production cuts versus technological rescue — promises to come to a head this year.Annual U.N.-sponsored climate talks meant to help keep countries on track to meet their pledges to cut emissions are being held this year in the United Arab Emirates.The talks will be hosted by Sultan al-Jaber, the chief executive officer of the Emirates' state oil company. Like the U.S. and several other countries, the Gulf nation is expanding drilling even as it champions the climate cause.Going into November's climate talks, al-Jaber is calling for a phase-out of ‘’fossil fuel emissions,"" leaving it ambiguous whether he means a ramping up of technology or is open to some production cuts.At the 2021 U.N. climate talks in Scotland, countries for the first time agreed to phase down the global use of coal. Talks the next year in Egypt saw a major push for a commitment to phase out oil and gas, but it failed.While nonbinding, any agreement out of this year's climate talks that the world should start phasing out oil and gas production would be a first. It would put governments and the industry on the spot to comply.Kerry rejected the idea of putting a deadline on phasing out oil and gas production. How fast that can happen depends partly on how fast the world moves to electric vehicles and renewable-fueled power grids, he said.Instead, he said, this year’s climate talks will “quite possibly” produce an international agreement to phase out the use of “unabated” oil and natural gas, meaning oil and gas where the carbon emissions are not captured. This could disappoint those calling for fast cuts in oil and gas production.Kerry said the deadline to watch is 2030. By then, the U.N.’s top climate panel says, the world will need to have nearly halved climate-damaging emissions to stave off the more devastating scenarios of global warming.“We can’t let the wish or the hope govern common sense here,” Kerry said. “If we know that we can get the job done by deploying more renewables and current technology, we ought to be doing that.”__This story was first published on May 14, 2023. It was updated on May 17, 2023, to fix the position of clarifying note that made clear the American Petroleum Institute was declining comment on how quickly carbon capture technology would be ready and to clarify its position on supporting federal policies.]"

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$463.0mUS$648.8mUS$651.0mUS$860.5mUS$810.0mUS$841.0mUS$866.6mUS$890.6mUS$913.5mUS$935.7mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.77%Est @ 2.57%Est @ 2.43% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% US$422US$538US$492US$592US$508US$480US$451US$422US$394US$368(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.7bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$936m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.8%– 2.1%) = US$12bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$12b÷ ( 1 + 9.8%)10= US$4.9bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$9.6b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$112, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ralph Lauren as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.291. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Ralph LaurenStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Luxury market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Ralph Lauren, we've put together three fundamental items you should further research:Risks: For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Ralph Lauren (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does RL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to explore similar stocks that Jim Cramer likes, you can also take a look at 5 ""Great"" Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About.""The Fed is Either Done Tightening, or Almost Done Tightening""On May 4, Jim Cramer of Mad Money shared his insights on the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike and its implications for investors. Cramer discussed the Fed's decision to raise rates by another 25 basis points. He pointed out that the Fed has now raised rates five times in just 14 months, making it the fastest series of rate increases in recent history.Cramer expressed his support for staying heavy in cash in the current environment, as he thinks several challenges lie ahead for the market. However, he also highlighted that the Fed's commitment to fighting inflation could bode well for stocks, particularly growth stocks, in the long term even if it drags them down in the short-term.According to Cramer, the Fed's approach to rate hikes will heavily depend on economic conditions. If the economy continues to heat up, the Fed may raise rates further. However, if it cools down, the Fed might take a more cautious stance. Cramer thinks that ""the Fed is either done tightening or almost done tightening"", however, he does not anticipate rate cuts in 2023.Cramer advised investors to consider investing in sectors that historically perform well during economic downturns. On the other hand, he also suggested buying housing stocks, citing that long-term interest rates have actually declined, which positively impacts mortgage rates. Additionally, Cramer also talked about investing in tech stocks since he thinks they will do well as the Fed stays committed to bringing inflation down to the target 2% rate. According to Jim Cramer, these counterintuitive approaches reflect the unique dynamics of the current market, where historical patterns may not hold true.Story continuesIn a recent episode, Jim Cramer broke down multiple corporate earnings and split them in three categories: ""great"", ""okay"", and ""more work to do"". Some companies that reported ""great"" earnings, according to Jim Cramer, include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.10 ""Great"" Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking AboutOur MethodologyWe watched the Mad Money episode that aired on May 2 and compiled a list of companies that reported ""great"" earnings, according to Jim Cramer. We then sourced each stock's hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey's database of roughly 900 money managers. We narrowed down our selection to stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58On April 24, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) posted earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $0.68 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.03. The company generated a revenue of $10.96 billion, up 4.35% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $175.16 million. As of May 12, the stock has gained 5.57% over the past 6 months.Cramer said that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ""crushed it, as always"". Jim Cramer noted that the company reported 12% organic growth, ahead of Wall Street estimates by 2%, and also said that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) had ""tremendous pricing power and solid share take"".At the end of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds were long The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and disclosed stakes worth $28.8 billion in the company. Of those, Berkshire Hathaway was the leading investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $25.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), other best-in-class stocks that delivered strong quarters include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).9. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Cramer likes American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) and thinks that the company had ""a gigantic quarter with tremendous growth"". American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, on April 20. The company reported an EPS of $2.40 and generated a revenue of $14.28 billion, up 21.70% year over year and ahead of revenue consensus by $265.91 million.71 hedge funds disclosed having stakes in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of Q4 2022. The total value of these stakes amounted to $26.8 billion. As of December 31, Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in the company and has a stake worth $22.4 billion.8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Cramer owns shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) through his charitable trust and said that the company has ""showed that nice progression that we have been waiting for"". Cramer noted that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported a ""line in the sand quarter"" and said that he anticipates strong performance over the next few quarters as the company's operating costs come down and it becomes ""a lot more profitable"".On April 21, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) announced strong earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company grew its revenue by 3.54% and generated a revenue of $20.07 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $747.3 million. The company reported earnings per share of $1.37 and beat expectations by $0.05. As of May 12, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has returned 10.63% to investors over the past 6 months.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was held by 74 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022. These funds held positions worth $4.71 billion in the company. As of December 31, Bridgewater Associates is the top shareholder and has a position worth $757 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

(NYSE:PM) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.54bUS$10.8bUS$11.6bUS$12.3bUS$12.8bUS$13.3bUS$13.8bUS$14.2bUS$14.6bUS$14.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x5Est @ 5.58%Est @ 4.54%Est @ 3.81%Est @ 3.30%Est @ 2.94%Est @ 2.69%Est @ 2.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$8.9kUS$9.3kUS$9.4kUS$9.2kUS$9.0kUS$8.7kUS$8.3kUS$8.0kUS$7.6kUS$7.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$86bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.1%) = US$285bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$285b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$139bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$225b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$95.1, the company appears quite good value at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Philip Morris International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.899. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Philip Morris InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Dividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Philip Morris International, we've compiled three additional factors you should further examine:Risks: Be aware that  Philip Morris International is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are significant...Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for PM's future outlook?

15,e6d2b68a-20c2-3484-ae3e-ccd82bdce583,SLB,2023-05-14,7 Growth Stocks That Are Facing Major Headwinds in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-growth-stocks-facing-major-183712664.html,1683657432,STORY,"['COIN', 'FUBO', 'DIS', 'CHGG', 'SLB']","[As anyone who regularly reads my columns knows, I’m generally optimistic about the outlooks of the U.S. economy and American stocks. And I think that investors are greatly undervaluing many growth stocks, particularly in the renewable energy, electric vehicle, and biotech spaces. Further, the valuations of most growth stocks have tumbled a great deal since 2020. Nonetheless, I still believe that some growth stocks are facing major challenges, while there are still many overvalued growth stocks to avoid at this point due to their excessive valuations.Indeed, some overvalued growth names look destined to emulate former meme favorites like Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (OTCMKTS:BBBYQ) by declaring bankruptcy in the medium term.Here are seven of the market’s worst growth stocks. Of course, investors should stay far away from these names, which are facing major, likely insurmountable, challenges.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCoinbase (COIN)Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.comOn Stocktwits, several cryptocurrency fans have told me they’re avoiding crypto exchanges like the one operated by Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). That’s because these crypto investors are worried that the exchanges will take their money, as FTX did, or get shut down by the government. And in the latter case, they may not be able to get all of their money back since the FDIC has said that it does not insure cryptos.Of course, crypto investors’ reluctance to use crypto exchanges does not bode well for Coinbase or COIN stock. And, given these worries, it’s not surprising that COIN reported fairly dismal first-quarter results on May 4.Last quarter, its revenue sank to $736 million from $1.165 billion during the same period a year earlier, and it reported a Q1 loss of $79 million, despite cutting a significant amount of its costs. Its total transaction revenue was especially weak, sinking to $374.7 million from $1.01 billion in Q1 of 2022.Story continuesAnd ominously, despite the rally of cryptos last quarter, its transaction revenue increased just $52.6 million versus the previous quarter.About 20% of the company’s other revenue is generated from staking, a practice that the SEC forced another exchange, Kraken, to stop.Consequently, COIN could literally lose its staking revenue at any time.And, as I’ve noted previously, Coinbase refuses to accede to the SEC’s request to register as a securities trading platform, leaving COIN vulnerable to heavy-handed enforcement actions by the agency.Indeed, the agency has warned that such actions against COIN are forthcoming, making the shares one of the most dangerous and worst growth stocks to own.Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB) sells equipment used to drill for oil. After spending much of 2022 well above $90 per barrel, oil prices have now sunk to below $75.According to the financial media, recession fears are to blame for the sharp decline in petroleum prices. But with the U.S. economy still growing significantly and China reopening, I don’t believe that economic fears are behind the drop in oil prices. Rather, I think that oil traders are finally noticing that electric-vehicle sales are soaring in the U.S., China, and the EU, while hydrogen could, in the not-too-distant future, become a viable alternative to oil-derived fuels for large trucks and planes.If my hypothesis is correct, oil prices are likely to stay at or below their current levels for the foreseeable future. As a result, oil companies will seek less oil, causing SLB’s top and bottom lines to sink.Moreover, unlike many other names in the oil sector, SLB isn’t cheap, as its trailing price-earnings ratio is a hefty 18.6x.FuboTV (FUBO)FuboTV (FUBO) logo on iPhone displaySource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.comI’ve long been skeptical about FuboTV’s (NASDAQ:FUBO) ability to attract a significant number of subscribers since, for subscribers, the streaming service’s cost is a little different than that of cable companies. To some extent, the company has proven me wrong, as its North American subscriber base at the end of last quarter rose 22% year-over-year to nearly 1.3 million.Still, 1.3 million isn’t that many, considering that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) had 74.4 million subscribers in America and Canada at the end of Q1. More importantly, Fubo continues to hemorrhage cash and spend large amounts of money on stock-based compensation. The latter practice tends to place a great deal of pressure on stock prices, and there’s no indication that the company plans to end or even greatly curtail the practice.Last quarter, for example, FUBO’s operations generated a negative cash flow of nearly $81 million, and it paid out stock-based compensation of almost $13.7 million. Those were much better than its Q4 levels of -$119 million and $17.43 million, respectively. And Fubo says that it expects to start generating positive cash flow in 2025.Still, given the tough competition that the company faces from low-cost streaming services and the fact that content costs are likely to climb meaningfully by 2025, I have my doubts about whether it can attain that goal in 2025 or ever.And if Fubo keeps relying heavily on stock-based compensation, its shares are likely to continue trending downward over the long term, even if it does manage to eke out a small profit.SoFi (SOFI)Mobile phone with website of US financial company Social Finance Inc (SoFi) on screen in front of logo Focus on top-left of phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comAs I reported in a previous, recent column, SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) was reportedly unable to sell any of its “available for sale personal loans” in Q1.Many of the company’s customers carry high levels of student debt, and SoFi’s student loan business has been hurt by the ongoing moratorium on the payments of such loans. Given all of these points, I believe that the company may have provided some high-risk personal loans to its customers, setting itself up for a great deal of trouble down the road.Expressing similar concerns, investment bank Wedbush downgraded its rating on the shares to “neutral” from “outperform” on May 1. The firm believes that the company’s failure to sell loans in Q1, as it usually does, may indicate that its loans aren’t as profitable as they previously were or that it’s having trouble finding buyers for them. Wedbush slashed its price target on the shares to $5 from $8.SoFi’s trailing price/sales ratio of 3.13 is rather elevated, given the potential issues with its loans and the tough competition it faces from some of the nation’s largest banks.Chegg (CHGG)Source: ShutterstockChegg (NYSE:CHGG), which provides online educational products, is, I believe, facing a “perfect storm.” On May 2, the company reported that the advent of ChatGPT, the widely used artificial intelligence tool, had begun hurting its efforts to recruit new customers in March.But I think that other issues may be negatively impacting the company’s growth as well. Specifically, the strong labor market could be causing fewer people to go back to school. After all, if you already have a secure, high-paying job, why do you need to go back to school?Reduced hiring by tech companies could also be hurting Chegg’s business. In past years, I believe that many students returned to school because they wanted to get lucrative jobs in the tech sector. With such positions no longer widely available, fewer Americans will go back to school and buy Chegg’s products.Finally, in order to compete with ChatGPT, Chegg has had to invest in its own AI offering, called CheggMate. That initiative could weigh significantly on Chegg’s bottom line going forward.AMC (AMC)In this photo illustration the AMC Entertainment Holdings logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen. APE stockSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comLike FuboTV, AMC’s (NYSE:AMC) financial results and user data improved significantly last quarter, but the movie theater operator is still burning large amounts of cash.Specifically, attendance at AMC’s U.S. movie theaters rose to 47.62 million in the first quarter, up from 39 million in the same quarter a year earlier, while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, rose by $68.8 million year-over-year to $7.1 million.But the company still burned a huge $190 million of cash in Q1 while it generated a dismally high free cash flow loss of $237.3 million. If AMC burns that much cash when the labor market is great, the economy is growing significantly, and worries about the coronavirus have all but disappeared, it’s difficult for me to picture (no pun intended) how it will ever come close to being profitable again.Adding to my pessimism is the fact that the company’s debt is still nearly $5 billion, meaning that it will probably have to pay a great deal f interest for the foreseeable future.Additionally, its stock-based compensation last quarter came in at a significant $25.9 million. High levels of stock-based compensation, like interest payments, are excluded from adjusted EBITDA calculations but weigh on companies’ shares.Given AMC’s poor financial situation, it’s definitely one of the growth stocks with headwinds at this point.Disney (DIS)dis stock the Disney logo in red font on a storefrontSource: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.comDisney’s (NYSE:DIS) ongoing feud with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is popular with a significant portion of the U.S., is likely to weigh on subscriptions to Disney’s Disney+ streaming service and hurt attendance at its U.S. theme parks. The battle could also distract the company’s management team, undermining its ability to improve its performance.Meanwhile, like AMC, Disney is going to continue to be hurt by the fact that movie theater attendance is never going to return to its pre-streaming glory days. Then add in the fact that the number of cable TV subscriptions continues to decline, reducing the profits that the company obtains from its cable channels. And Disney’s streaming channels still aren’t profitable.In a pessimistic note on DIS stock issued on April 14, Barclays cut its price target on the shares to $104 from $114 and kept an “equal weight” rating on the name. The bank warned that Disney’s full-year results could come in below analysts’ average estimates.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a short position in COIN.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Phillips 66's shares on or after the 19th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 1st of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.05 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$4.20 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Phillips 66 stock has a trailing yield of around 4.5% on the current share price of $93.22. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Phillips 66 paid out just 15% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 22% of its cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Phillips 66 has grown its earnings rapidly, up 22% a year for the past five years. Phillips 66 looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Phillips 66 has delivered an average of 18% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayIs Phillips 66 an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that Phillips 66 is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Phillips 66 looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Phillips 66 and you should be aware of this before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

View our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:55% = US$3.5b ÷ US$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.55 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 55% ROETo begin with, TJX Companies has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 20% which is quite remarkable. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why TJX Companies saw little to no growth in the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared TJX Companies' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 26% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about TJX Companies''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is TJX Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 39% (implying that the company keeps 61% of its income) over the last three years, TJX Companies has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Moreover, TJX Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 37% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, TJX Companies' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 61% for future ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like TJX Companies has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

With 88% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mastercard. View our latest analysis for Mastercard ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mastercard?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Mastercard. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Mastercard's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.3% and 6.8% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 19 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of MastercardThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Mastercard Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$386m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mastercard   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.22bUS$11.9bUS$11.6bUS$12.8bUS$13.3bUS$13.8bUS$14.2bUS$14.6bUS$14.9bUS$15.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.26%Est @ 2.92%Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$8.4kUS$9.8kUS$8.6kUS$8.7kUS$8.2kUS$7.7kUS$7.2kUS$6.7kUS$6.2kUS$5.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$77bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$193bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$193b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$73bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$151b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$104, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at QUALCOMM as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.359. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for QUALCOMMStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you want to explore similar stocks that Jim Cramer likes, you can also take a look at 5 ""Great"" Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About.""The Fed is Either Done Tightening, or Almost Done Tightening""On May 4, Jim Cramer of Mad Money shared his insights on the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike and its implications for investors. Cramer discussed the Fed's decision to raise rates by another 25 basis points. He pointed out that the Fed has now raised rates five times in just 14 months, making it the fastest series of rate increases in recent history.Cramer expressed his support for staying heavy in cash in the current environment, as he thinks several challenges lie ahead for the market. However, he also highlighted that the Fed's commitment to fighting inflation could bode well for stocks, particularly growth stocks, in the long term even if it drags them down in the short-term.According to Cramer, the Fed's approach to rate hikes will heavily depend on economic conditions. If the economy continues to heat up, the Fed may raise rates further. However, if it cools down, the Fed might take a more cautious stance. Cramer thinks that ""the Fed is either done tightening or almost done tightening"", however, he does not anticipate rate cuts in 2023.Cramer advised investors to consider investing in sectors that historically perform well during economic downturns. On the other hand, he also suggested buying housing stocks, citing that long-term interest rates have actually declined, which positively impacts mortgage rates. Additionally, Cramer also talked about investing in tech stocks since he thinks they will do well as the Fed stays committed to bringing inflation down to the target 2% rate. According to Jim Cramer, these counterintuitive approaches reflect the unique dynamics of the current market, where historical patterns may not hold true.Story continuesIn a recent episode, Jim Cramer broke down multiple corporate earnings and split them in three categories: ""great"", ""okay"", and ""more work to do"". Some companies that reported ""great"" earnings, according to Jim Cramer, include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.10 ""Great"" Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking AboutOur MethodologyWe watched the Mad Money episode that aired on May 2 and compiled a list of companies that reported ""great"" earnings, according to Jim Cramer. We then sourced each stock's hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey's database of roughly 900 money managers. We narrowed down our selection to stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58On April 24, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) posted earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $0.68 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.03. The company generated a revenue of $10.96 billion, up 4.35% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $175.16 million. As of May 12, the stock has gained 5.57% over the past 6 months.Cramer said that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ""crushed it, as always"". Jim Cramer noted that the company reported 12% organic growth, ahead of Wall Street estimates by 2%, and also said that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) had ""tremendous pricing power and solid share take"".At the end of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds were long The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and disclosed stakes worth $28.8 billion in the company. Of those, Berkshire Hathaway was the leading investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $25.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), other best-in-class stocks that delivered strong quarters include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).9. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Cramer likes American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) and thinks that the company had ""a gigantic quarter with tremendous growth"". American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, on April 20. The company reported an EPS of $2.40 and generated a revenue of $14.28 billion, up 21.70% year over year and ahead of revenue consensus by $265.91 million.71 hedge funds disclosed having stakes in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of Q4 2022. The total value of these stakes amounted to $26.8 billion. As of December 31, Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in the company and has a stake worth $22.4 billion.8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Cramer owns shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) through his charitable trust and said that the company has ""showed that nice progression that we have been waiting for"". Cramer noted that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported a ""line in the sand quarter"" and said that he anticipates strong performance over the next few quarters as the company's operating costs come down and it becomes ""a lot more profitable"".On April 21, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) announced strong earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company grew its revenue by 3.54% and generated a revenue of $20.07 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $747.3 million.

These funds held positions worth $4.71 billion in the company. As of December 31, Bridgewater Associates is the top shareholder and has a position worth $757 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ""shot the lights out"" and the company's ""revolutionary cancer drug"" KEYTRUDA posted ""incredible numbers"".

Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster1 drug Keytruda. The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

(NYSE:PWR) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Quanta Services Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$888.8mUS$985.8mUS$1.15bUS$1.30bUS$1.44bUS$1.54bUS$1.63bUS$1.71bUS$1.77bUS$1.83bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 7.25%Est @ 5.71%Est @ 4.63%Est @ 3.87%Est @ 3.34% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$820US$839US$903US$941US$962US$952US$928US$896US$859US$819(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.9bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.1%) = US$30bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$13bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$22b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$174, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Quanta Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.056. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Quanta ServicesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Construction industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Construction market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Quanta Services, we've put together three pertinent aspects you should consider:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Indeed, valuation is key for those with a long-term investing time horizon. Acquisition cost and return on investment over time are typically key metrics that matter.Indeed, many dividend stocks provide distributions that are unsustainable. Accordingly, finding companies that have a robust business model, and will be able to maintain their distribution over the long term, is also important.These three undervalued dividend stocks meet my criteria of having a reasonable valuation, a strong growth profile, and a meaningful dividend yield. Let’s dive in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNorthrop Grumman (NOC)A photograph of the underside of a Northrop Grumman stealth bomber.Source: Philip Pilosian / Shutterstock.comNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is a great buy among blue-chip defense stocks. That’s partly due to the company’s appealing forward price-earnings ratio of 20.4 times and a dividend yield of 1.5%, which puts NOC stock among the undervalued dividend stocks I like right now. This is more true following the company’s robust Q1 2023 earnings, which signal the stock could get cheaper over time if the company performs as expected.Northrop Grumman’s Q1 sales reached $9.3 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year increase. The company also has a robust order backlog of $77.5 billion, ensuring revenue and cash flow visibility for the future. Northrop’s commitment to shareholder value creation is evident in its $1 billion spending on dividends and share repurchases in Q1.Northrop Grumman is venturing into the drone technology sector with the creation of autonomous HALE systems, which are currently being developed with a global reach and over 24-hour endurance.

Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockDespite facing cost and workforce challenges, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) emerged as one of the best gold producers last year, thanks to its superior cost control and expansion projects. The company achieved record margins that surpassed its 5-year averages and aimed to strengthen its position in the most lucrative mining jurisdictions.Story continuesAgnico Eagle Mines’ primary focus is on gold production, although it has a pipeline of projects in the U.S. and Colombia aimed at exploring and developing existing mineral deposits to enhance its gold and silver production profile.Agnico Eagle Mines performed well last year, overcoming cost and workforce challenges and maintaining superior cost control. Despite this, its stock has risen 6.5% in the past year, increasing optimism among potential investors. Despite the company’s substantial earnings valuation, it is an excellent investment because of its strong three-year earnings growth and higher net profit over the majority of its rivals.Restaurant Brands (QSR)Source: ShutterstockRestaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR), recognized for its selection of fast food brands, has had a successful year so far, with QSR stock rising over 10% since January 1 at the time of writing. This can be attributed to the company’s defensive stance and the power of its main brands.Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman’s report on Restaurant Brands International, released on May 3, 2023, suggests an outperform rating on the stock and a price target increase from $74 to $79, indicating that QSR’s stock is expected to outperform the market average, with a projected price increase to $79.This stock is attractive for its defensive nature and reasonable valuation of 21 times earnings. Additionally, it showed impressive performance in recent quarterly results with 8.5% higher comparable same-store sales year-over-year and growth rates of 180 bps and 40 bps for Popeye’s and Burger King banners, respectively.Restaurant Brands reported strong financial results, with earnings per diluted share growing by over 21% to $3.25 and sales rising by 13.4% to $6.5 billion.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At International Business MachinesThe CFO and Senior VP of Finance &amp; Operations, James Kavanaugh, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$134 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$123. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In total, International Business Machines insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.07% of International Business Machines shares, worth about US$79m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About International Business Machines Insiders?The fact that there have been no International Business Machines insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Our analysis of International Business Machines insider transactions leaves us cautious. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for International Business Machines (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.But note: International Business Machines may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:V) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Visa The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At VisaIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Vice Chair, Kelly Tullier, sold US$6.1m worth of shares at a price of US$233 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$231. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Visa shares, than buying. They sold for an average price of about US$225. It's not too encouraging to see that insiders have sold at below the current price. Of course, the sales could be motivated for a multitude of reasons, so we shouldn't jump to conclusions. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Visa Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Visa. In total, insiders dumped US$15m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$237m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Visa Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Visa stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. On the plus side, Visa makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Visa has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on NVIDIA is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$5.6b ÷ (US$41b - US$6.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).Therefore, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Semiconductor industry average of 13% it's much better. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NVIDIA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering NVIDIA here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of NVIDIA's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 32%, but since then they've fallen to 16%. However it looks like NVIDIA might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.In Conclusion...To conclude, we've found that NVIDIA is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 365% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesLike most companies, NVIDIA does come with some risks, and we've found 3 warning signs  that you should be aware of.While NVIDIA may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) so let's look a bit deeper.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Genuine Parts is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$17b - US$7.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Genuine Parts has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Retail Distributors industry average of 18%. See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Genuine Parts compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Genuine Parts here  for free.What Can We Tell From Genuine Parts' ROCE Trend?The trends we've noticed at Genuine Parts are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 19%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 28%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Genuine Parts thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.On a side note, Genuine Parts' current liabilities are still rather high at 47% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Genuine Parts' ROCETo sum it up, Genuine Parts has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 113% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.Genuine Parts does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Genuine Parts  that you might be interested in.While Genuine Parts isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Worryingly, the AP reported recently that the banking crisis isn’t over yet. It’s just a matter of how much pain we may incur.If that’s the case, you don’t want to mess around with too many risk-on assets. Instead, you should consider recession-proof stocks to buy now. Thanks to their resilient profile or their business models’ emerging relevancies during rising troubles, these stout enterprises may fare better (perhaps even much better) than others. In addition, as circumstances become more ambiguous, investors may assign a premium toward wealth protection over outright wealth accumulation. Therefore, market participants may want to target the below safe haven stocks in volatile market.DLTRDollar Tree$155.17KOCoca-Cola$63.39CLColgate-Palmolive$80.64TJXTJX Companies$78.59NEENextEra Energy$75.58KELYAKelly Services$16.25MCYMercury General$29.87InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDollar Tree (DLTR)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buySource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comWe’re just going to get right into it with the technical performance of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR). On a year-to-date basis through May 5, DLTR gained nearly 11% of equity value. During the same period, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index gained a bit over 8%. That’s a conspicuous gap over the broad index, implying greater demand for discount retailers. Of course, that’s a mixed bag for the economy.Nevertheless, for investors, DLTR easily ranks within the best safe stocks for market crash list. Financially, Dollar Tree doesn’t offer the sturdiest books, I must say. However, it gets the job done. For example, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 3.6, which slightly rides into the safe zone.Operationally, Dollar Tree features a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.5%, above 69.47% of defensive retail players. Also, its trailing-year net margin impresses at a lofty 5.7%. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg DLTR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is a modest $158.83, implying over 2% upside potential. Still, for recession-proof stocks to buy now, it’s difficult to ignore.Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockFor much of this year, shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) fell into negative territory. However, in the past month, KO gained over 2% of equity value. Fundamentally, Coca-Cola should move higher as the trade-down effect takes hold. Basically, consumers may start trading down their caffeine addiction from pricey coffeeshops to soda cans at the grocery store.Financially, KO doesn’t make for the most remarkable name within the best safe stocks for market crash list. However, it does enjoy high fiscal stability and low risk of bankruptcy, as evidenced by its Altman Z-Score of 4.33. Operationally, though, its three-year revenue growth rate of 4.6% is just above average for the non-alcoholic beverages industry.However, Coca-Cola’s strength centers on consistent profitability. Presently, its trailing-year net margin stands at 22.69%, above 95.33% of its rivals. Thus, it’s a strong idea for the safe haven stocks in volatile market list. Lastly, analysts peg KO as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $69.44, implying over 8% upside potential.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAs with Coca-Cola above, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) fell into negative territory in the charts for much of this year. But in the trailing one-month period, CL gained over 7% of market value. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, CL poked its head above parity by nearly 2%. Fundamentally, investors should have confidence that this recovery will continue. Basically, no matter how bad the economy gets, everyone needs to brush their teeth.Just from the perspective of common sense, CL should make the best safe stocks for market crash list. That said, the financials present somewhat of a mixed bag. Regarding stability, Colgate brings it in spades, according to the Altman Z-Score of 6.38. Operationally, though, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is only 50.23%, just a bit above average for the consumer packaged goods industry.Nevertheless, CL intrigues because the underlying enterprise commands consistent profitability. Also, its trailing-year net margin is 8.71%, above 76.25% of its peers. To close out, analysts peg CL a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $87.46, implying almost 9% upside potential.TJX Companies (TJX)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comOn paper, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) doesn’t seem particularly encouraging because its shares slipped roughly 1% YTD. However, TJX attempts to rank within the best safe stocks for market crash list with its recent performance. Since March 13, TJX shot up nearly 7%. Fundamentally, as companies start normalizing their workplace environment (i.e. recalling workers), people will look to upgrade their wardrobe for cheap.Naturally, TJX off-price department store business should be relevant for this endeavor. Thus, it ranks within the safe haven stocks in volatile market list. Financially, the company offers a decent canvas. First, TJX’s Altman Z-Score hits a credible 5.16, indicating stability and low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 7.6%, above 65.36% of the competition.On the bottom line, TJX enjoys consistent profitability (10 consecutive years of net income). Also, its net margin is 7%, above 76.26% of sector players. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg TJX a unanimous strong buy. On average, their price target stands at $90.73, implying almost 16% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the low-risk high-reward stocks to consider.NextEra Energy (NEE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Admittedly, shares of the American energy firm NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) don’t seem particularly helpful under the context of best safe stocks for market crash. Down nearly 10% for the year through the May 5 session, NEE will require patience. However, the company also commands enormous relevancies for its renewable infrastructure network. Plus, power companies tend to enjoy natural monopolies.Over the past 365 days, NEE did return shareholders almost 7%; thus, it’s not a completely speculative idea. Now, like other regulated utilities, NextEra doesn’t command the greatest financial stats if we’re being honest. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate is only 2.3%, which is poor compared to the wider industry. However, NextEra benefits from consistent profitability. Also, its net margin smokes the field at 26.97%, above 90.85% of its peers. With a return on equity of 17.31%, it’s also one of the high-quality defensive stocks to consider.Looking to the Street, analysts peg NEE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $89.64, implying nearly 19% upside potential.Kelly Services (KELYA)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comWhile keeping in the spirit of best safe stocks for market crash, I’m going to dial up the risk-reward factor with the last two ideas. First, staffing agency Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) might be a compelling idea to consider. Sure, since the beginning of this year, KELYA slipped more than 4%. Also, in the past month, it dipped 1%, which seemingly doesn’t offer much confidence.However, I’m almost certain that KELYA deserves to be one of the recession-proof stocks to buy now because of layoffs. With pink slips flying across other industries besides technology, desperation should make Kelly Services interesting. Also, the company differs from other staffing firms in that it covers a wide footprint, including manufacturing and logistics.Financially, investors will point to Kelly’s three-year revenue growth rate of 1.6% below zero. However, the company suffered disproportionately during the Covid-19 crisis. With the pandemic fading but worker desperation rising, Kelly stands ready to rock and roll. Lastly, analysts peg KELYA as a moderate buy. Their average price target hits $24, implying nearly 48% upside potential. Thus, the experts believe it’s one of the low-risk high-reward stocks.Mercury General (MCY)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen.

However, as you’ll see later, the upside for MCY may be phenomenal. Nevertheless, investors shouldn’t ignore the risk. Since the Jan. opener, MCY fell slightly more than 14%. In the trailing one-year period, it’s down a staggering 41%. Of course, I have some explaining to do.Fundamentally, I appreciate Mercury’s auto insurance business. Let’s face it – the roadways aren’t getting any safer. And people just seem to be on edge these days, meaning that financial protection is a must. Also, for the vast majority of states in the Union, auto insurance is the law. Therefore, Mercury benefits from a captive audience. To be sure, Mercury suffered from the Covid-19 crisis. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate sits at 2.9% below zero. Also, its book growth rate is 5.4% below breakeven.Nevertheless, well-respected Raymond James analyst Charles Peters pegs MCY a buy. Also, the expert forecasts a price target of $45, implying over 52% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

When we see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) in conjunction with a declining base of capital employed, that's often how a mature business shows signs of aging. This indicates to us that the business is not only shrinking the size of its net assets, but its returns are falling as well. On that note, looking into Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), we weren't too upbeat about how things were going.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Juniper Networks:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.081 = US$587m ÷ (US$9.3b - US$2.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Juniper Networks has an ROCE of 8.1%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Communications industry average of 9.1%. View our latest analysis for Juniper Networks roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Juniper Networks compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Juniper Networks' historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 11% that they were earning five years ago. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Juniper Networks becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesOur Take On Juniper Networks' ROCEIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. In spite of that, the stock has delivered a 26% return to shareholders who held over the last five years. Regardless, we don't like the trends as they are and if they persist, we think you might find better investments elsewhere.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Juniper Networks, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

It’s currently 20.6%, well above 8%, the percentage I look for in value plays. STLD hit a 52-week high of $136.46 in early March before falling considerably due to its weak outlook for the remainder of the year. Steel Dynamics reported Q1 earnings in late April. The good news was that it earned an adjusted $4.04 a share, 20 cents better than expected. The bad news is that its earnings were 33% lower than in Q1 2022.

To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In.Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), or fast food restaurants as most people know them, have been among the few restaurant stocks that fared well even during the COVID-19 pandemic. These stocks continue to do well today because of their resilience and consumer reliance on quick and quality food options in times of crisis. Fast food chains also tend to do well in the market because of the vast consumer base available to them. Most of these chains operate internationally and have managed to retain overseas markets for decades. This has led to widespread recognition of, and a taste for, many renowned fast food chains across the globe, whether you are looking at developing countries or developed ones.The QSR 50Some of the most well-known fast food chains with international footprints include the McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), and The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN). Each of these companies, and many of those like them, have managed to build brand loyalty for themselves since they have been operating, and most of them have come to be considered common household names when it comes to picking a place to grab takeout from. Since these companies have made such a name for themselves in the fast food sector today, they have become part of the QSR 50 list - a list of the top QSR companies operating across the globe today.The QSR 50 Report for 2022 listed McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as the top QSR company in 2022. Through 2021, the company's system-wide sales rose by 21% to reach the $112 billion mark, a new record for the restaurant chain. The domestic sales for McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) also rose by 13.8% over the same period, which signaled the highest-recorded comps performance since the company began reporting this metric in 1993. Digital sales for the company also crossed $18 billion by the end of 2021, which was another record. All in all, these factors enabled the company to be named the number one QSR on the list for 2022.Story continuesApart from McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) also ranked high on the list, coming in at number five, while Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) came in at number nine. These companies, alongside the other names listed below in this article, have all been included in the QSR 50 list because of their stellar performance in the past and their ability to retain their customers at times when the financial markets are taking a hit. As such, the QSR 50 list has proven itself to be a highly valuable resource for scouting top-tier fast-food restaurant companies every year.What Did 2022 Say About The Fast Food Industry?According to the QSR 50 report, many fast food companies benefited during the pandemic because they were well-positioned to support off-premises dining. Since most fast-food restaurants already offer drive-thru services, the takeaway frenzy that began during the pandemic was only more of the same for them. If there's anything fast-food chains learned during this time, it is that their customers will continue to be loyal to brands that please them with a well-rounded and high-quality experience.Restaurants that failed to provide this experience to their customers did suffer from customer dissatisfaction. This has been measured by the report through a metric it has designed and named ""theme performance scores"" (TPS), where a higher score indicates that the restaurant concerned was performing well, while a lower score indicated the opposite. Using this metric, the report shows that brands such as Chick-Fil-A and Culver's managed to satisfy their customers with their food and dedication to serving. As a result, these brands had 1.4 and 2.09 for their respective TPS. However, KFC and Taco Bell were surprisingly seen to have dissatisfied their customers with their food quality and dedication during the pandemic, leading to both these brands being awarded scores as low as 0.55 and 0.74, respectively. In this manner, the report shows us that fast-food restaurants could not survive merely by banking on their growing sales during difficult times, but rather, they had to focus on improving the quality of their food and service just as much as regular restaurants. With these insights from 2022, many fast-food stocks are set to improve their service in 2023, leading us to compile a list of the best fast-food stocks to buy today.10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest InJonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comLet's now take a look at the 10 best fast food stocks to invest in.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list below, we used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked.

If you want to explore similar stocks that Jim Cramer likes, you can also take a look at 5 ""Great"" Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About.""The Fed is Either Done Tightening, or Almost Done Tightening""On May 4, Jim Cramer of Mad Money shared his insights on the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike and its implications for investors. Cramer discussed the Fed's decision to raise rates by another 25 basis points. He pointed out that the Fed has now raised rates five times in just 14 months, making it the fastest series of rate increases in recent history.Cramer expressed his support for staying heavy in cash in the current environment, as he thinks several challenges lie ahead for the market. However, he also highlighted that the Fed's commitment to fighting inflation could bode well for stocks, particularly growth stocks, in the long term even if it drags them down in the short-term.According to Cramer, the Fed's approach to rate hikes will heavily depend on economic conditions. If the economy continues to heat up, the Fed may raise rates further. However, if it cools down, the Fed might take a more cautious stance. Cramer thinks that ""the Fed is either done tightening or almost done tightening"", however, he does not anticipate rate cuts in 2023.Cramer advised investors to consider investing in sectors that historically perform well during economic downturns. On the other hand, he also suggested buying housing stocks, citing that long-term interest rates have actually declined, which positively impacts mortgage rates. Additionally, Cramer also talked about investing in tech stocks since he thinks they will do well as the Fed stays committed to bringing inflation down to the target 2% rate. According to Jim Cramer, these counterintuitive approaches reflect the unique dynamics of the current market, where historical patterns may not hold true.Story continuesIn a recent episode, Jim Cramer broke down multiple corporate earnings and split them in three categories: ""great"", ""okay"", and ""more work to do"". Some companies that reported ""great"" earnings, according to Jim Cramer, include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58On April 24, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) posted earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $0.68 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.03.

Of those, Berkshire Hathaway was the leading investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $25.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), other best-in-class stocks that delivered strong quarters include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

The total value of these stakes amounted to $26.8 billion. As of December 31, Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in the company and has a stake worth $22.4 billion.8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Cramer owns shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) through his charitable trust and said that the company has ""showed that nice progression that we have been waiting for"". Cramer noted that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported a ""line in the sand quarter"" and said that he anticipates strong performance over the next few quarters as the company's operating costs come down and it becomes ""a lot more profitable"".On April 21, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) announced strong earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ""shot the lights out"" and the company's ""revolutionary cancer drug"" KEYTRUDA posted ""incredible numbers"".

The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%). Merck produced over $48 billion in sales in 2021, just under half of which were generated in the United States. Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster1 drug Keytruda. The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

61,771686ec-92b5-3a5e-8642-f1d3418b9902,MDLZ,2023-05-14,‘We didn’t ruin Cadbury – we made it better’,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/didn-t-ruin-cadbury-made-090000996.html,1684054800,STORY,"['MDLZ', 'KHC']","[Dirk Van de Put, the CEO of Cadbury's parent company Mondelez - Andrew FoxCadbury needed to be taken over to improve its flagging business, the chief executive of its US owner has claimed.Dirk Van de Put, chief executive of Mondelez, the Chicago-owner of Cadbury, said his company had improved the British chocolate maker since its controversial 2010 takeover.He said: “It’s like you’re sick and you need to take some medicine. We took some medicine but in the end, the business is in a much better position than it was when we took it over.”Many would take issue with the claim that Cadbury was struggling when Kraft Foods launched a hostile bid for the company in 2009.The chocolate maker controlled about 10pc of the global confectionery sales and around a third of the market in Britain. Global sales were up 11pc in 2009 and it took £1.36bn in Britain alone despite the global economic downturn.Today Cadbury’s market share is more or less flat in Britain compared to when it was taken over, at around 31pc. Sales were around £1.8bn last year in Britain, according to industry estimates.However, Mr Van de Put argued that Cadbury has only been able to maintain its market share thanks to investment on a scale that only a major conglomerate such as Kraft Foods could provide. (Kraft Foods' chocolate and biscuit brands were spun off as Mondelez in 2012.)Mondelez said it has invested nearly £300m into Cadbury’s operations in the UK over the last decade to improve chocolate factories that it argues were under-performing European rivals.Mr Van de Put said: “Look at the health of Cadbury as a brand and as a business now and when we took it over. The numbers, the consumers… It's night and day.”The £11.5bn hostile takeover of Cadbury was the most controversial foreign takeover of a British business so far this century.The deal was opposed by everyone from unions to politicians and even City investors.The prospect of a predatory American firm snapping up a beloved British brand was seized on by then-business secretary Lord Mandelson, who accused Kraft of wanting to “turn round a short-term profit and make a quick buck”.Story continuesHe said the deal would face “huge opposition, not just from the workforce and the local population but also from the British government”.Unions warned that up to 30,000 jobs could be at risk from the takeover and protestors picketed Cadbury’s Birmingham headquarters after the deal was announced, with one sign urging Kraft to “go to hell”.cadbury kraft takeover - PAUL ELLIS/AFP/Getty ImagesEven Legal &amp; General, the investment giant that was Cadbury’s second biggest shareholder, opposed the sale of “this iconic and unique British company”.However, ultimately money won out and the 199-year–old chocolatier was sold to the US. (Lord Mandelson admitted he was powerless to stop the deal but urged Kraft to continue making “perfectly formed Creme Eggs” in Britain.)Kraft Foods appeared to prove its critics right when it almost immediately shut a Cadbury factory in Bristol, despite promising not to do so during the takeover process.The incident earned a rebuke from Britain’s takeover regulator.A decision in 2017 to move production of some Dairy Milk products to Poland also sparked outcry given Kraft had vowed to keep making the brand at Cadbury's Bournville headquarters in the aftermath of the takeover.Mondelez defended the move as a temporary measure as it upgraded the Birmingham factory.Mondelez’s UK boss Louise Stigant said a small handful of Dairy Milk products continue to be made in Poland today, but “the majority” is now once again being made in the brand's historic home.Cadbury factory in Bournville - Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesAnother £15m was spent upgrading the Bournville factory in 2021 to allow it to produce an additional 125 million large sharing bars of Dairy Milk each year.Ms Stigant said: “The Bournville plant needed some very significant investment to make it competitive.”Mondelez operates nine factories across the country, employing over 4,000 people. As well as the British chocolate maker, Mondelez also owns Oreo, Toblerone, Ritz and Green &amp; Black's.However, Mr Van de Put describes Cadbury as the “jewel in the crown”.Cadbury produces around 132,000 tonnes of chocolate per year in Bournville, of which about 90pc is sold in the UK and Ireland.In the lead up to Easter, over one million Cadbury Creme Eggs and 400 million Cadbury Dairy Milk Buttons are made there every day.Mr Van de Put has been in charge of Mondelez since 2017. He succeeded the architect of the Cadbury deal, Irene Rosenfeld.Mr Van de Put said Britain has become a tougher place to operate in recent years.The 62-year-old said: “[The UK] is certainly not the easiest country to do business in in the world.”The Belgian-born executive is frustrated with how Britain’s exit from the European Union has played out.“What we produce in the UK, a big chunk stays in the UK but we also export to Europe. With Brexit that has become complicated. We have to shift production around so the additional costs we have are quite big.“Not that the UK should go back on Brexit, but if it could… get another agreement that would make it more easy for us.”However, Mondelez remains committed to Britain and believes businesses can still make a success of it, he said.“Would that mean that you would invest less in the UK? No, not at all. Would that mean that we think our business will not be so successful going forward? Not at all. It’s just more difficult.”Like all businesses, Mondelez is being buffeted by rising costs, with Mr Van de Put reeling of “labour inflation, transportation inflation, commodities inflation” as the biggest headaches.Rising costs have forced prices of its chocolates and snacks higher, but he denies this is aide of pushing up profits.“Our prices go up, but our percentage margin has gone down.”Asked what he makes of ongoing allegations that big food companies are pushing through over-inflated price increases, he said: “I can’t speak for the industry, but in our case, that is not true.“What we have taken as a principle is that we do want to offset our input costs as much as we can.”More than 1m Creme Eggs are made every day in Bournville ahead of Easter - Simon Dawson/BloombergThe company has chosen to shrink some products rather than increase prices. It cut the size of its medium Dairy Milk bars from 200g to 180g in 2022, for instance, but kept the price the same. Ms Stigant and Mr Van de Put were speaking at the company's Bournville headquarters close to where the chocolate brand was founded.The company was established in 1824 by John Cadbury, a Quaker, who started off selling tea, coffee and drinking chocolate in the centre of Birmingham.Cadbury launched its first chocolate bar in 1849 and, in 1854, was granted a royal warrant by Queen Victoria.Bournville became the company’s centre of manufacturing in the 1870s and has remained so ever since. It was set up as a “model village”  with hundreds of cottages and houses for workers.It was part of a paternalistic approach to capitalism that extended to paying workers unusually high wages for the time, creating a health service for them and introducing pension schemes.In recent years, rivals have questioned Cadbury's ethical credentials.Tony’s Chocolonely, the Dutch chocolatier that has taken a public stance against eradicating forced labour in the chocolate supply chain, criticised the company in 2022 after a Channel 4 documentary claimed to have found children as young as 10 working in Ghana to harvest cocoa pods that it claimed ended up in Mondelez's supply chain.Mr Van de Put said Mondelez immediately launched an investigation and insisted the company is committed to eradicating forced labour in its supply chain.He pointed out it is a far more complex task for a business the size of Mondelez because of the sheer number of farmers it works with and the complexity in the supply chain.“Is it possible to take positions like Tony’s when you’re small, and your supply chain is very controlled? Yes. If you become bigger, like Cadbury is, or any other chocolate brands, we need to work on a more systematic solution, and we have extensive programmes.“It’s going to take a while but it’s not like we’ve thrown in the towel and said this is never going to get solved.”Mr Van de Put added: “I personally think that we’ve done a very good job and we’ve been very good stewards of the business.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

63,e3935b2e-6b9c-3a34-ba22-c7f7384eecca,NSC,2023-05-14,Why Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) Could Be Worth Watching,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-norfolk-southern-corporation-nyse-131636783.html,1683983796,STORY,['NSC'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$255 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$199. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Norfolk Southern's current trading price of US$212 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Norfolk Southern’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern What's The Opportunity In Norfolk Southern?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 13.03% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Norfolk Southern today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $187.47, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Norfolk Southern’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Norfolk Southern generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 15% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Norfolk Southern. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? NSC’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NSC, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Norfolk Southern, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

If you want to explore similar stocks that Jim Cramer likes, you can also take a look at 5 ""Great"" Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About.""The Fed is Either Done Tightening, or Almost Done Tightening""On May 4, Jim Cramer of Mad Money shared his insights on the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike and its implications for investors. Cramer discussed the Fed's decision to raise rates by another 25 basis points. He pointed out that the Fed has now raised rates five times in just 14 months, making it the fastest series of rate increases in recent history.Cramer expressed his support for staying heavy in cash in the current environment, as he thinks several challenges lie ahead for the market. However, he also highlighted that the Fed's commitment to fighting inflation could bode well for stocks, particularly growth stocks, in the long term even if it drags them down in the short-term.According to Cramer, the Fed's approach to rate hikes will heavily depend on economic conditions. If the economy continues to heat up, the Fed may raise rates further. However, if it cools down, the Fed might take a more cautious stance. Cramer thinks that ""the Fed is either done tightening or almost done tightening"", however, he does not anticipate rate cuts in 2023.Cramer advised investors to consider investing in sectors that historically perform well during economic downturns. On the other hand, he also suggested buying housing stocks, citing that long-term interest rates have actually declined, which positively impacts mortgage rates. Additionally, Cramer also talked about investing in tech stocks since he thinks they will do well as the Fed stays committed to bringing inflation down to the target 2% rate. According to Jim Cramer, these counterintuitive approaches reflect the unique dynamics of the current market, where historical patterns may not hold true.Story continuesIn a recent episode, Jim Cramer broke down multiple corporate earnings and split them in three categories: ""great"", ""okay"", and ""more work to do"". Some companies that reported ""great"" earnings, according to Jim Cramer, include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.10 ""Great"" Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking AboutOur MethodologyWe watched the Mad Money episode that aired on May 2 and compiled a list of companies that reported ""great"" earnings, according to Jim Cramer. We then sourced each stock's hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey's database of roughly 900 money managers. We narrowed down our selection to stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58On April 24, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) posted earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $0.68 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.03. The company generated a revenue of $10.96 billion, up 4.35% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $175.16 million. As of May 12, the stock has gained 5.57% over the past 6 months.Cramer said that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ""crushed it, as always"". Jim Cramer noted that the company reported 12% organic growth, ahead of Wall Street estimates by 2%, and also said that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) had ""tremendous pricing power and solid share take"".At the end of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds were long The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and disclosed stakes worth $28.8 billion in the company. Of those, Berkshire Hathaway was the leading investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $25.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), other best-in-class stocks that delivered strong quarters include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).9. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Cramer likes American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) and thinks that the company had ""a gigantic quarter with tremendous growth"". American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, on April 20. The company reported an EPS of $2.40 and generated a revenue of $14.28 billion, up 21.70% year over year and ahead of revenue consensus by $265.91 million.71 hedge funds disclosed having stakes in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of Q4 2022. The total value of these stakes amounted to $26.8 billion. As of December 31, Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in the company and has a stake worth $22.4 billion.8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Cramer owns shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) through his charitable trust and said that the company has ""showed that nice progression that we have been waiting for"". Cramer noted that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported a ""line in the sand quarter"" and said that he anticipates strong performance over the next few quarters as the company's operating costs come down and it becomes ""a lot more profitable"".On April 21, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) announced strong earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company grew its revenue by 3.54% and generated a revenue of $20.07 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $747.3 million.

These funds held positions worth $4.71 billion in the company. As of December 31, Bridgewater Associates is the top shareholder and has a position worth $757 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ""shot the lights out"" and the company's ""revolutionary cancer drug"" KEYTRUDA posted ""incredible numbers"".

(NYSE:MRK) and held positions worth $5.16 billion in the company. Of those, AQR Capital Management was the leading investor in the company and held a position worth $344.8 million.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Founded in 1891 and headquartered in New Jersey, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms. The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%). Merck produced over $48 billion in sales in 2021, just under half of which were generated in the United States. Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster1 drug Keytruda. The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

If you want to explore similar stocks that Jim Cramer likes, you can also take a look at 5 ""Great"" Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About.""The Fed is Either Done Tightening, or Almost Done Tightening""On May 4, Jim Cramer of Mad Money shared his insights on the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike and its implications for investors. Cramer discussed the Fed's decision to raise rates by another 25 basis points. He pointed out that the Fed has now raised rates five times in just 14 months, making it the fastest series of rate increases in recent history.Cramer expressed his support for staying heavy in cash in the current environment, as he thinks several challenges lie ahead for the market. However, he also highlighted that the Fed's commitment to fighting inflation could bode well for stocks, particularly growth stocks, in the long term even if it drags them down in the short-term.According to Cramer, the Fed's approach to rate hikes will heavily depend on economic conditions. If the economy continues to heat up, the Fed may raise rates further. However, if it cools down, the Fed might take a more cautious stance. Cramer thinks that ""the Fed is either done tightening or almost done tightening"", however, he does not anticipate rate cuts in 2023.Cramer advised investors to consider investing in sectors that historically perform well during economic downturns. On the other hand, he also suggested buying housing stocks, citing that long-term interest rates have actually declined, which positively impacts mortgage rates. Additionally, Cramer also talked about investing in tech stocks since he thinks they will do well as the Fed stays committed to bringing inflation down to the target 2% rate. According to Jim Cramer, these counterintuitive approaches reflect the unique dynamics of the current market, where historical patterns may not hold true.Story continuesIn a recent episode, Jim Cramer broke down multiple corporate earnings and split them in three categories: ""great"", ""okay"", and ""more work to do"". Some companies that reported ""great"" earnings, according to Jim Cramer, include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.10 ""Great"" Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking AboutOur MethodologyWe watched the Mad Money episode that aired on May 2 and compiled a list of companies that reported ""great"" earnings, according to Jim Cramer. We then sourced each stock's hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey's database of roughly 900 money managers. We narrowed down our selection to stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58On April 24, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) posted earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $0.68 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.03. The company generated a revenue of $10.96 billion, up 4.35% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $175.16 million. As of May 12, the stock has gained 5.57% over the past 6 months.Cramer said that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ""crushed it, as always"". Jim Cramer noted that the company reported 12% organic growth, ahead of Wall Street estimates by 2%, and also said that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) had ""tremendous pricing power and solid share take"".At the end of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds were long The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and disclosed stakes worth $28.8 billion in the company. Of those, Berkshire Hathaway was the leading investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $25.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), other best-in-class stocks that delivered strong quarters include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).9. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71Cramer likes American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) and thinks that the company had ""a gigantic quarter with tremendous growth"". American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, on April 20. The company reported an EPS of $2.40 and generated a revenue of $14.28 billion, up 21.70% year over year and ahead of revenue consensus by $265.91 million.71 hedge funds disclosed having stakes in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of Q4 2022. The total value of these stakes amounted to $26.8 billion. As of December 31, Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in the company and has a stake worth $22.4 billion.8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Cramer owns shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) through his charitable trust and said that the company has ""showed that nice progression that we have been waiting for"". Cramer noted that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported a ""line in the sand quarter"" and said that he anticipates strong performance over the next few quarters as the company's operating costs come down and it becomes ""a lot more profitable"".On April 21, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) announced strong earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company grew its revenue by 3.54% and generated a revenue of $20.07 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $747.3 million. The company reported earnings per share of $1.37 and beat expectations by $0.05. As of May 12, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has returned 10.63% to investors over the past 6 months.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was held by 74 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2022. These funds held positions worth $4.71 billion in the company. As of December 31, Bridgewater Associates is the top shareholder and has a position worth $757 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ""shot the lights out"" and the company's ""revolutionary cancer drug"" KEYTRUDA posted ""incredible numbers"".

(NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Founded in 1891 and headquartered in New Jersey, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms. The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%). Merck produced over $48 billion in sales in 2021, just under half of which were generated in the United States. Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster1 drug Keytruda. The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

67,7553e0fa-cc94-3ef2-a33a-df5878f46fa4,LKQ,2023-05-14,LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lkq-nasdaq-lkq-paying-larger-121921425.html,1684066761,STORY,['LKQ'],"[LKQ Corporation's (NASDAQ:LKQ) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.275 on 1st of June. The payment will take the dividend yield to 1.9%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for LKQ LKQ's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. However, LKQ's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 7.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 23% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendLKQ Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryIt's not possible for us to make a backward looking judgement just based on a short payment history. This doesn't mean that the company can't pay a good dividend, but just that we want to wait until it can prove itself.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. LKQ has impressed us by growing EPS at 19% per year over the past five years. LKQ definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.LKQ Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Gap's stock price has reduced by 41% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield. Check out our latest analysis for Gap Gap Is Paying Out More Than It Is EarningA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Despite not generating a profit, Gap is still paying a dividend. Along with this, it is also not generating free cash flows, which raises concerns about the sustainability of the dividend.The next 12 months is set to see EPS grow by 181.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could reach 114%, which probably can't continue without putting some pressure on the balance sheet.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.50 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.60. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 1.8% a year over that time. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Over the past five years, it looks as though Gap's EPS has declined at around 36% a year. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Story continuesWe're Not Big Fans Of Gap's DividendOverall, while some might be pleased that the dividend wasn't cut, we think this may help Gap make more consistent payments in the future. The company seems to be stretching itself a bit to make such big payments, but it doesn't appear they can be consistent over time. Overall, this doesn't get us very excited from an income standpoint.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.
